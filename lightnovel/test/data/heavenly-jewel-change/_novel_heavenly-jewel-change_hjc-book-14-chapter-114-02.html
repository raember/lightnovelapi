                                            charged state, did not even think before charging forward. It was only until
                                            he was standing in front of Zhou Weiqing protectively, that he suddenly
                                            remembered that he was only at the two-Jeweled stage, without a single piece
                                            of Consolidated Equipment…</p>
                                        <p>“Good brother…” Zhou Weiqing’s voice came from behind, causing Ma Qun’s
                                            quivering heart to stabilize a little.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Zhou Weiqing’s first meeting with Ma Qun had been his wily
                                            tricks, trying to fool him. As such, he did not have a good first impression
                                            of him, and did not think too highly of him. It was only at this point that
                                            he truly started to look upon Ma Qun as a true brother.</p>
                                        <p>The remaining three black Zun Stage enemies and the single seven-Jeweled
                                            powerhouse paused slightly at the sight of Ma Qun’s appearance. Zhou Weiqing
                                            had given them too huge of a shock, and they subconsciously thought that
                                            anyone together with Zhou Weiqing would be powerful as well. That was
                                            especially since they knew of the existence of Lin TianAo, that ultimate
                                            Defense Heavenly Jewel Master. Seeing the yellow glow around the large body
                                            of Ma Qun’s, they immediately stopped, and did not charge forward.</p>
                                        <p>However, in the next moment, they spotted the puny two Physical Jewels around
                                            Ma Qun’s wrist, and an embarrassed look crossed their faces. They were all
                                            at least upper level Zun Stage or higher, and they had actually been
                                            intimidated by a mere two-Jeweled little fellow. That was such a huge loss
                                            of face.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was not in a good state currently. The coughing out of blood was
                                            actually not the main issue, after all, in the Demonic Change State, his
                                            toughness, resistance, and ability to take hits was not to be
                                            underestimated. Furthermore, his own physique and healing capabilities was
                                            also extremely strong. Added to the fact, the Immortal Deity Shield had also
                                            helped blocked a large portion of damage, and the enemy’s strike, while
                                            powerful, was not his full strength too. Although Zhou Weiqing had been
                                            injured, it was not very serious.</p>
                                        <p>However, the true problem was that in that attack, it had caused Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s Devoured Heavenly Energy to be in trouble. His energy whirlpools
                                            had already slowed down to almost a halt, causing his internal Heavenly
                                            Energy to be in a messy flux, and he was unable to fully control the
                                            external Devoured Heavenly Energy. As such, he was in a total mess
                                            internally, even his Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms were on the verge of losing
                                            control and dissipating.</p>
                                        <p><i>What now?!</i> Zhou Weiqing’s mind spun rapidly. If Ma Qun was not here,
                                            he believed that he could still manage to attempt to escape, and perhaps
                                            barely succeed. As long as he could escape, with his recovery rate and many
                                            Skills, he definitely had a chance of staying alive. However, Ma Qun was now
                                            right in front of him… how could he possibly run away at this time. If he
                                            did so, Zhou Weiqing would never be able to forgive himself. As such, he
                                            could only stay and fight.</p>
                                        <p>Making a prompt decision on the spot, Zhou Weiqing instantly dismissed the
                                            Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms, taking out the Black Dawn Bow from his Spatial
                                            Ring and nocking an arrow to it. At his current state, he could no longer
                                            afford to use any more Consolidated Equipment, and could only fight with his
                                            archery. Although his efforts might be, and would most likely be futile,
                                            there was always a small thread of hope if he fought with all his might…</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, at this critical moment, a door of a small room to the side
                                            opened, and Dou Dou walked out in a confused state. “What are you all doing…
                                            so noisy… I was sleeping so soundly…”</p>
                                        <p>Seeing her blurry look, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but feel a sense as if he
                                            did not know whether to laugh or cry. They had been fighting so loudly
                                            outside, yet this girl could still sleep so soundly.</p>
                                        <p>With the appearance of Little Miss Muddle, the four black clad men who had
                                            been about to launch their attacks paused once more. However, this time,
                                            they did not delay for long. After all, Dou Dou did not seem even as
                                            threatening as Ma Qun, and they dismissed her quickly. Instantly, the four
                                            of them jumped up and pounced towards Ma Qun and Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>“You all can’t hit him!” Dou Dou said urgently. As she said that, no one else
                                            could clearly see how she moved, and in a silver flash of light, Dou Dou was
                                            standing right in front of Ma Qun and Zhou Weiqing, blocking the four black
                                            clad men’s route. The next moment, another bright screen of silver light
                                            rose up, and four muffled thumping sounds rang out, and the four black clad
                                            men all flew backwards about ten yards before landing hard.</p>
                                        <p>Dou Dou spread apart her delicate, thin hands, making an action like a mother
                                            chicken protecting her young chicks. She was not tall, her figure that of a
                                            petite young lady, and that action of hers in contrast to her figure would
                                            have seemed rather funny. However, at that moment, no one found it funny at
                                            all, because around those delicate hands of hers, seven glowing Dragonstone
                                            Jade Physical Jewels revolved around her left wrist, while seven blue-green
                                            Elemental Jewels revolved around her right wrist.</p>
                                        <p>It was a unique blue-green colour, a gem that was rare enough that the black
                                            clad men did not recognize it at once. However, Zhou Weiqing instantly did.
                                            They were Alexandrite Gemstones!</p>
                                        <p>What did Alexandrite Gemstones signify? It meant that Dou Dou’s Elemental
                                            Jewels had at least between two to four Elemental Attributes!</p>
                                        <p>As such, the ones who were the most shocked weren’t their enemies, but Zhou
                                            Weiqing and Ma Qun!</p>
                                        <p>None of them had imagined that this Little Miss Muddle who only seemed to
                                            know how to eat all day long would be such a hidden powerhouse.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of age, Dou Dou was actually a little older than the three Shangguan
                                            sisters, but even so, Zhou Weiqing had not expected her to be actually at
                                            the seven-Jeweled stage.</p>
                                        <p>As for the four black clad enemies, their expressions were extremely ugly.
                                            After a short moment of stunned dullness, they finally recognized the rare
                                            Alexandrite gemstone, and that she had used a Spatial Attribute earlier
                                            against them.</p>
                                        <p>Then again, Dou Dou’s teacher was the greatest God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master in the world today, Xing Tianyi. For him to fancy her
                                            talents enough to take her as his disciple, how could her talent and gifts
                                            be low at all?</p>
                                        <p>In fact, Dou Dou’s Elemental Jewel Attributes were that of Spatial and Wind,
                                            with her Physical Jewel being that of the Agility Attribute. Although in
                                            terms of Consolidating Equipment Master talent, she could not compare to
                                            Zhou Weiqing with the additional Time Attribute, she could already be
                                            considered to be one of the rare talents that came about only once in a
                                            hundred years. Furthermore, in terms of disposition and character, Dou Dou
                                            definitely had a large edge over Zhou Weiqing. She was much more simple,
                                            pure in nature, and it was definitely a lot easier for someone like her to
                                            focus on one thing, and not be distracted easily by anything else. If not
                                            for the fact that Xing Tianyi approved of Zhou Weiqing and thought well of
                                            his character, he would not have allowed his precious disciple to leave
                                            together with him!</p>
                                        <p>As for Dou Dou’s cultivation level, that was even simpler. As the only main
                                            disciple of the greatest Consolidating Equipment Master, who was also a
                                            powerful Heavenly Jewel Master in his own right, how could she lack any
                                            teachings. Furthermore, she was also older than Shangguan Xue’er, and with
                                            her simple nature, she had definitely spent a lot of time focused on
                                            cultivating as well. More so, in terms of treasures and supplements for her
                                            training, how could she possibly lack those with Xing Tianyi behind her?</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s mouth trembled a little. No wonder Old Xing had said that Dou
                                            Dou could protect herself. From what she had shown so far, she was probably
                                            even more powerful than he was now.</p>
                                        <p>“Dou Dou, beat them up, and I’ll give you something good to eat.” After
                                            spending these few days with her, Zhou Weiqing had a very good understanding
                                            about Dou Dou, and he immediately threw out his top ‘weapon’ of allure to
                                            her.</p>
                                        <p>Dou Dou blinked her eyes, looking at Zhou Weiqing awkwardy, saying: “But…
                                            but… Big Bro Little Fatty, I do not know how to beat someone up! However, I
                                            won’t let them beat you too… if they beat you til you are broken, then I
                                            won’t have anything to eat.”</p>
                                        <p>“Let’s go.” The Low Level Zong Stage enemy could not withstand the pressure
                                            any longer. Seeing Dou Dou’s power, he did not think that Dou Dou was
                                            telling the truth, and assumed that she was mocking them.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, at this point, it was too late for them.</p>
                                        <p>Along the walls of the courtyard, a few figures appeared, and Lin TianAo’s
                                            voice rang out from above. “Did you think you could leave so easily after
                                            taking action in our Fei Li City? Get them!”</p>
                                        <p>It was not just Lin TianAo. Crow, Little Four, Xiao Yan, Drunken Bao and Yun
                                            Li had all arrived.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why they had taken so long to was due to the fact that they had
                                            won the champion of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and they been delayed by
                                            some celebrations in the Heavenly Jewel Academy. After which, they had
                                            joined up with Yun Li before heading down to Zhou Weiqing’s house. Luckily,
                                            they had clearly seen the Heavenly Skill Image of the Demonic Dragon Lady in
                                            the distance while en route, and they had rushed down immediately, to arrive
                                            just in time at this point.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo and the others did not have time to be shocked about Little Miss
                                            Muddle’s power, and they quickly launched their attacks.</p>
                                        <p>With his companions all here, Zhou Weiqing no longer needed to hold back
                                            anything. Of course, in his current state, he couldn’t do much else to help.
                                            Still, the Dragon Silencing Seal did not require any Heavenly Energy to use,
                                            and he expended the last three of his remaining Dragon Silencing Seals on
                                            the low level Zong Stage and two other upper level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters.</p>
                                        <p>These black clad men might have a high cultivation level, but in terms of
                                            Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills, they were no match for the members
                                            of the Fei Li Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>The Fei Li Battle Team could be said to be the cream of the crop of the
                                            younger generation of the entire Fei Li Empire. This was especially so for
                                            Lin TianAo, who had actually already broken through to the six-Jeweled stage
                                            a day before, and he had already Consolidated the sixth shield of his
                                            Assembly Set. Let alone these six, seven Jeweled Masters in front of him, it
                                            would not be easy for even ordinary eight or nine Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters to break through his defense. Furthermore, these black clad men had
                                            already expended a lot of their energy in the fight against Zhou Weiqing,
                                            and now with the Dragon Silencing Seal, they could be said to be fangless
                                            tigers. Instantly, they were in a severely disadvantageous position.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing his companions surround and attack the enemies, Zhou Weiqing heaved a
                                            sigh of relief. Under the protection of Ma Qun and Dou Dou, he backed down
                                            to the side and sat down cross-legged to start to cultivating and
                                            recovering. Before that, he did not forget to summon the two Icy Soul
                                            Heavenly Bears to head to the walls, as a precaution in case the four
                                            enemies tried to escape.</p>
                                        <p>In this fight today, Zhou Weiqing had used so many of his Skills, and if
                                            possible, he did not want any of the enemies to escape and allow the Bai Da
                                            Empire to learn more about his own abilities. As such, when Lin TianAo and
                                            the rest had charged forward, he had already given them the signal to kill
                                            them off. Towards members of the Bai Da Empire, he did not have any shred of
                                            mercy, as they were already mortal enemies.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>In the end, Zhou Weiqing's ace-up-the-sleeves Icy Soul Heavenly Bears did not
                                            get to do anything. Under the effect of the Dragon Silencing Seal, the
                                            seven-Jeweled Zong Stage Master was not even able to take on Lin TianAo, and
                                            the other four naturally did not stand any chance against the rest of the
                                            team.</p>
                                        <p>Xiao Yan managed to kill off one, while Crow also chopped down another with
                                            her Axes. The last two were also taken down by the others working together.
                                            The Bai Da Empire had truly suffered a great loss today, having lost all
                                            eight of the powerful Heavenly Jewel Masters they had sent to assassinate
                                            Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>In the end, clearing the battlefield was a simple task. Lin TianAo was an
                                            Earth Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, and he easily commanded the earth to
                                            swallow up the bodies before restoring to its original state.</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, are you alright?” After getting rid of the bodies, Lin TianAo
                                            walked up to Zhou Weiqing. At this point, no one knew why, but Ma Qun had
                                            cowered to another corner with his head lowered, and only Dou Dou was at
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s side.</p>
                                        <p></p>
