                                            aid, especially with three elite Heavy Cavalry Regiments… it was clear that
                                            they had already realised the importance of the Peerless Battalion to this
                                            war. Perhaps all those reinforcements added together might not be able to
                                            defeat the Mammoth Regiment, but he was confident that it was definitely
                                            sufficient to protect the Peerless Battalion. The only worry Hua Feng had
                                            was the Eagle Tribesmen Air Force Regiment high up in the sky… After all,
                                            being suppressed was not a good feeling at all. The destructive power of the
                                            Eagle Tribesmen soldiers were not to be underestimated at all, and besides
                                            the Heavy Infantry soldiers and the Purple Tasseled Regiments, the rest of
                                            the Northwest Army Regiments would not likely be able to block their
                                            attacks.</p>
                                        <p>“Wait a while more.” Hua Feng said solemnly.</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi said urgently: “Battalion Commander, let us go. They do not have any
                                            more javelins, they haven’t thrown any in quite some time. Our Brothers can
                                            hold up their shields as we charge up… there should not be any big danger.
                                            Once we reach a sufficient distance, we will be able to exchange fire, and
                                            show them our own strength.”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng hesitated a moment, eyeing the skies calmly. Finally, he turned to
                                            Shangguan Fei’er and said: “Chief Drill Instructor, please lead the First
                                            Main Company up. I leave them in your capable hands.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er had long since been aching to join the fight, and she nodded
                                            before turning to Lei Zi, saying: “I’ll lead the way to draw their fire and
                                            cause them some trouble first. You all follow suit.”</p>
                                        <p>As she said that, two dark gold lights sprang out in an aura around Shangguan
                                            Fei’er’s body. At the same time, a green light spread out from her body,
                                            sweeping up several dozen of the fallen Eagle Tribesmen javelins that had
                                            fallen to the ground. As Shangguan Fei’er flew up into air at lightning
                                            speed, those javelins flew up right behind her, and the massive gold and
                                            green ray flew towards Eagle Tribesmen Air Force Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>The massive dark gold Consolidated Wings and her sheer speed caused Shangguan
                                            Fei’er to look like a strange dark--gold meteor smashing towards the Eagle
                                            Tribesmen Air Force.</p>
                                        <p>The greatest strength and advantage of the Eagle Tribesmen Air Force was that
                                            they were airborne. In terms of pure defensive capabilities, they were
                                            perhaps no match for even the Wolf Cavalry soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>As Shangguan Fei’er flew up into air, dozens of blood mist sprayed out in mid
                                            air. The javelins that Shangguan Fei’er had thrown up with her powerful
                                            Heavenly Xu Energy and Wind Attribute force was not something that ordinary
                                            War Eagle mounts or Eagle Tribesmen could handle. As for Shangguan Fei’er,
                                            she had already charged into the midst of the Eagle Tribesmen, like a war
                                            goddess smashing into them.</p>
                                        <p>She had long since been bursting with impatience, itching to join the fight.
                                            After all, she was most adept at air combat… it was what she had trained for
                                            all her life… being suppressed by an enemy air force, how could she feel
                                            happy at all? She did not use her other Consolidated Equipment, not even her
                                            bracer-claws, just with her pair of dark gold Consolidated Wings, and she
                                            was like an unstoppable spear stabbing savagely deep into the formation of
                                            the Eagle Tribesmen. Where she flew to, the corpses of the War Eagles and
                                            Eagle Tribesmen fell, and the Eagle Tribesmen Regiment which had been
                                            enjoying their unparalleled easy life high in the skies were suddenly put in
                                            disorder and disarray.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, the Eagle Tribesmen Regiment knew about the Peerless Battalion
                                            having several hundred Air Force troops of their own. As such, they had
                                            saved a portion of the javelins in preparation of their attack which they
                                            had expected at any time. Alas, they had never in their wildest imaginations
                                            dreamed that it would only be a single person flying up first… a single but
                                            deadly person indeed.</p>
                                        <p>Soon after, Lei Zi led his First Main Company behind Shangguan Fei’er, all of
                                            them using their small round shields held protectively in front of them as
                                            they flew at top speeds high up into the skies.</p>
                                        <p>When the Northwest Armies soldiers saw five hundred men actually fly up into
                                            the skies and charging towards Eagle Tribesmen Regiment, their jaws almost
                                            dropped in shock. They only had one thought in mind: <i>Since when did we
                                                have an Air Force?! </i></p>
                                        <p>The facts had indeed proved themselves… What Lei Zi promised to Hua Feng
                                            earlier was no exaggeration. As the gap between the two Air Forces drew
                                            close, the first salvo of the Peerless Battalion First Main Company Air
                                            Force once again rang out with the familiar shrill ringing of arrows flying
                                            through the sky, and what resulted was a tragedy for the Eagle
                                            Tribesmen.</p>
                                        <p>It wasn’t that the Eagle Tribesmen lacked powerhouses, but when Shangguan
                                            Fei’er had charged in at the front, all of the powerhouses had gone after
                                            her.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the superiority of personal flight versus mounted flight
                                            showed itself. In midair, Shangguan Fei’er moved around at lightning speed,
                                            and the sheer speed and agility was not something that the War Eagles could
                                            match, especially while carrying their riders. Amongst the Eagle Tribesmen
                                            Air Force Battalion, there were a few dozen Heavenly Jewel Masters, and out
                                            of them there were a few Six and Seven Jeweled ones. However, even for them,
                                            against Shangguan Fei’er’s terrifying offensive power, they did not have a
                                            chance at all.</p>
                                        <p>Along with the shrill sounds of the Consolidated Bows and arrows, a large
                                            cloud of blood mist appeared in the skies. Below, the four thousand and five
                                            hundred Peerless Battalion soldiers on the ground shouted in unison:
                                            “Peerless… Peerless!” This time, even the Northwest Army soldiers were
                                            infected, shouting out loud together with them. Under the leadership of the
                                            Purple Tasseled Regiment, the four Cavalry Regiment reinforcements charged
                                            towards their foes.</p>
                                        <p>When armies met on the battlefield, one of the most important things that
                                            would influence outcome was definitely morale. With the invincible Eagle
                                            Tribesmen Air Force suffering an unforeseen beating, it was like injecting
                                            an extra boost of stimulants to the entire ZhongTian Northwest Army. More
                                            importantly, the Peerless Battalion had proven to them that the Beastmen
                                            were not unbeatable. In a short amount of time, soldiers used their lives to
                                            start pushing back against the berserking Tyrannical Bear Regiment, and for
                                            once with some measure of success.</p>
                                        <p>The Eagle Tribesmen Regiment realised things were not going well, but by the
                                            time they wanted to react better against the Peerless Battalion, they had
                                            already reached the same level height as them.</p>
                                        <p>Being at equal height meant that only arrows could be of any use, and the
                                            javelins would no longer be effective.</p>
                                        <p>Even for the finest javelin thrower, being able to throw a distance of a
                                            hundred yards accurately was already a miracle. Normally, the effective
                                            killing distance of a thrown javelin was about forty to fifty metres, but in
                                            mid air, what was a mere forty or fifty yards?</p>
                                        <p>Next, the true clash would be the archery skills and defensive capabilities
                                            of both sides.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, with the protection of their War Eagle mounts, the Eagle Tribesmen
                                            had a pretty decent defense. However, when compared to the Peerless
                                            Battalion all dressed in titanium mail, their defense was definitely not on
                                            the same league. More importantly, the killing power of the Peerless
                                            Battalion’s Consolidated Bows were far superior to the ordinary, if well
                                            crafted, long bows of the Eagle Tribesmen warriors.</p>
                                        <p>In just four rounds of exchanging shots, several hundred out of the two
                                            thousand Eagle Tribesmen Air Force fell to the ground. Seeing that things
                                            were not going well, the Eagle Tribesmen Regiment did not dare continue
                                            fighting against the Peerless Battalion, fleeing back towards their side.
                                            The Peerless Battalion Air Force gave chase, and in the end barely a hundred
                                            of the strongest Eagle Tribesmen managed to escape with their lives. The two
                                            thousand strong Eagle Tribesmen Air Force had been almost wiped out.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion Air Force were not done with that. After all, throwing
                                            javelins was not just something the Eagle Tribesmen could do. Soon after,
                                            the first salvo of javelins from the Peerless Battalion descended upon the
                                            Mammoth Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, the Mammoth Regiment truly lived up to their names as the aces and
                                            ultimate elites of the WanShou Empire. Their huge and tough bodies, along
                                            with the massive wooden totem poles in their hands… even the javelins thrown
                                            by the Peerless Battalion did not manage to harm them, with only a few
                                            causing some minor injuries.</p>
                                        <p>From the air, it was extremely clear to see everything on the ground and the
                                            situation. Shangguan Fei’er did not continue chasing the remnants of the
                                            Eagle Tribesmen Regiment, instead turning around and leading the Eagle
                                            Tribesmen Air Force back towards the center lines of the ZhongTian Army
                                            formations. She knew that not all of the Beastmen would be as powerful or
                                            tough as the Mammoth Tribesmen, being able to withstand the onslaught of the
                                            javelins.</p>
                                        <p>By this time, each of the Peerless Battalion Air Force soldiers only had
                                            about three javelins each, and they were all ‘gifted’ to the currently
                                            berserking Tyrannical Bear Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>At least a thousand Bear Tribesmen Heavy Infantry soldiers were savagely
                                            pinned to the ground, and the Peerless Battalion soldiers on the ground also
                                            started targeting the Raging Bull Regiments with their arrows.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that once the Peerless Battalion Air Force had taken down
                                            the Eagle Tribesmen, the tide of the battle was fully turned at last, and
                                            for the first time the ZhongTian Northwest Army were not on the back
                                            foot.</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, the Purple Tasseled Regiment had also started clashing
                                            against the Mammoth Regiment. The strongest part of the Purple Tasseled
                                            Regiment was that they had an entire Squad of Physical Jewel Masters with
                                            cultivation levels of Six Jewels and above. These hundred men had personal
                                            strength that was at least able to hold their own against the Mammoth
                                            Tribesmen warrior. Under their leadership, although the four Cavalry
                                            Regiments had serious losses, at least they were managing to block the
                                            offense of the two Regiments.</p>
                                        <p>By now, the destructive power of the Peerless Battalion was beginning to drop
                                            substantially. The main reason was because the ordinary Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers on the ground had the majority of their Heavenly Energy expended,
                                            and they had no choice but to switch to their ordinary longbows and arrows.
                                            Such arrows when against the Raging Bull and Tyrannical Bear Regiment
                                            soldiers, they were not able to do much damage.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the Peerless Battalion Air Force was still going well. After all,
                                            previously on the battleground, they had been conserving their strength, and
                                            this was their time to shine.</p>
                                        <p>Who knows if it was because she had been exposed to Zhou Weiqing for too long
                                            a time, Shangguan Fei’er had become so much craftier than before. She did
                                            not get the Peerless Battalion Air Force to continue firing arrows with
                                            their Consolidated Bows, instead flying down to the ground and gathering up
                                            more javelins that the Eagle Tribesmen had thrown down previously. With
                                            that, each of them gathered up a bunch of javelins and flew back into the
                                            sky… and once again, tragedy struck the Tyrannical Bear and Raging Bull
                                            Regiments.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Long led a group of his Tribesmen, and as the Peerless Battalion Air Force
                                            rose back into the air again, they charged into the battlefield. Their
                                            target was naturally the scattered Heavenly Beast Unicorns that were now
                                            wondering amiss after their riders had been killed. The current biggest
                                            problem that the Peerless Battalion faced was their lack of movement and
                                            transportation, so how could they let go of so many Unicorns Heavenly
                                            Beasts? After all, these Unicorns were able to withstand even the weight of
                                            the heavy female warriors of the Gold Crow Tribe!</p>
                                        <p>When the Peerless Battalion descended once again to collect another round of
                                            javelins, the WanShou Empire Armies finally decided they had enough, and the
                                            order to retreat was given. The remaining WanShou Empire Beastmen soldiers
                                            retreated like a tidal wave, with the last one to retreat being the powerful
                                            Mammoth Regiment. Although the WanShou Empire had indeed taken a big loss
                                            here, the Mammoth Regiment’s sheer power still sent shivers down the spines
                                            of all the ZhongTian Army soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>With aid and support from the Nimble Panther Regiment, the thousand Mammoth
                                            Berserker Soldiers had actually managed to take down almost a third of the
                                            elite Purple Tasseled Regiment, and the other three Heavy Cavalry Soldiers
                                            lost almost half their men forever on this battlefield. This was also
                                            because the fight had not lasted too long. Perhaps if they had continued
                                            fighting on longer, even the Purple Tasseled Regiment was at the risk of
                                            being wiped out. The scary thing was that when the Mammoth Regiment finally
                                            retreated, they did not even leave behind a single corpse… their massive,
                                            terrifying bodies like that of a steel fortress, and even after such a tough
                                            fight, they had only sustained injuries, without a single death. In fact,
                                            most of the injuries had been either caused by the Physical Jewel Master
                                            Squad of the Purple Tasseled Regiment, or the javelins thrown previously by
                                            the Peerless Battalion Air Force.</p>
                                        <p>The Northwest Armies did not give any order to give chase… attempting to
                                            strike out at Beastmen on the open fields was always a choice that ended in
                                            a tragedy of blood and tears.</p>
                                        <p>When the Peerless Battalion Air Force descended back to the ground, the
                                            entire Northwest Army, from soldier to officer, raised the weapons in their
                                            hands. The slogan of the Peerless Battalion had somehow become that of the
                                            entire Northwest Arrmy… “Peerless in the world!” The four words rang out
                                            throughout the entire battlefield… throughout the entire north west
                                            zone…</p>
                                        <p>Despite the fact that during this battle, the Northwest Armies had lost more
                                            than a hundred thousand of their soldiers’ lives, this was still considered
                                            a major victory in the fight between both Empires… an unprecedented victory
                                            in the history of their war indeed.</p>
