                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing turned to Lin TianAo and said: “I guess Bing’er will take while
                                            more, let’s go down and see how the rest are doing first. If they have
                                            already finished choosing their Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, I’ll settle
                                            their payments first before returning here by myself to wait for Bing’er.
                                            Leader, as for your Scroll, we’ll wait until tomorrow before coming here
                                            alright?”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo knew that it would be a rare chance for Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan
                                            Bing’er to meet up today, and he did not want to waste any time of it.
                                            Nodding, he said: “No problems, there is no rush for my Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scroll.”</p>
                                        <p>Both of them returned to the first level to look for the other members of the
                                            Fei Li Battle Team, and they had already chosen their Scrolls. As a
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master, Zhou Weiqing helped them look through to see
                                            if their choices were good, and soon after, they made the purchases at the
                                            Consolidating Equipment Pavilion.</p>
                                        <p>Although the members of the Fei Li Battle Team had all ‘conned’ Zhou Weiqing,
                                            they did not overdo it. Besides Lin TianAo, the other five had spent a total
                                            of sixteen million gold coins. Of course, this was after a ten percent
                                            discount.</p>
                                        <p>As for Little Witch, Zhou Weiqing would naturally not pay for her. Currently,
                                            she was nowhere to be seen; after all, she was here this time on behalf of
                                            the Heavenly Demon Sect to purchase a large amount of Scrolls and Materials,
                                            and would likely be carrying a large amount of gold coins. As for what
                                            exactly she bought, Zhou Weiqing had no interest in finding out. It was the
                                            business of the Heavenly Demon Sect, and not a secret that he wanted to
                                            know, but no matter what, it was likely a massive purchase.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing turned to Lin TianAo and said: “You guys go ahead first, if you
                                            want to head back or explore the area further. I’ll be waiting for
                                            Bing’er.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo said: “Do you want me to go with you?” This was after all the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island, and could be said to be populated by many
                                            powerhouses. He was afraid that Zhou Weiqing might encounter any
                                            problems.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “That shouldn’t be necessary. In this place,
                                            I’m certain that any Heaven’s Expanse Palace disciple will be stronger than
                                            us; if anything really happens, even if you are there, it will not make any
                                            difference. Do not worry, I will be fine, I’ll just be waiting for Bing’er.
                                            We are after all guests for the Heavenly Jewel Tournament.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo nodded, and the rest of them left. Just as Zhou Weiqing was about
                                            to head back up to the fourth level, Shangguan Longyin entered the Pavilion
                                            and spotted him.</p>
                                        <p>“You all sure do not waste any time. After reporting to the Palace Masters
                                            about your requests, I returned to your inn to look for you, but you had
                                            already came to the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion. How was it? Did you
                                            find any suitable scrolls?” Shangguan Longyin asked sincerely.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “My companions have already chosen
                                            and purchased their own, and as for myself, I was of course waiting for
                                            you.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin said: “Weiqing, the two Palace Masters have said, since the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament is about to start, there isn’t sufficient time. We
                                            hope that you will go through the Tournament with all your power, and once
                                            the Tournament is over, no matter what the result is, we will go through the
                                            trade according to the terms you have mentioned. Is that alright?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “That sounds great. It’s a deal then.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin said: “You still have two more days to prepare yourselves,
                                            and I hope you make use of that time wisely. The finals is a very different
                                            ball game from the preliminary heats, and everything will be decided in this
                                            one single ‘fight’. The other three teams have all entered the finals
                                            before, and they have some idea about the finals. Let me give you a simple
                                            idea about it - in the finals, you will be going through a massive
                                            free-for-all in a unique environment, you will find out more when it
                                            actually starts. I truly look forward to you pulling off a miracle once
                                            more.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, Shangguan Longyin patted Zhou Weiqing on the shoulder
                                            before turning to leave.</p>
                                        <p>One should not underestimate just that short and simple explanation that
                                            Shangguan Longyin had given Zhou Weiqing. To the Fei Li Battle Team, this
                                            being their first time at the finals of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and
                                            with their opponents all experienced, this could spell the difference
                                            between a swift defeat and some hope of success. In any case, it would at
                                            least give them two days of preparation.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing hurried back down, managing to catch up with Lin TianAo at the
                                            first level, and told him about Shangguan Longyin’s description. After
                                            which, he headed back to the fourth level to wait for Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>At the same time as Zhou Weiqing was anxiously waiting for Shangguan Bing’er,
                                            Shangguan Fei’er had already left the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion and
                                            had walked over to one of the inns on the Heavenly Jewel Island.</p>
                                        <p>“Hello, Young Miss.” All the employees of the various establishments around
                                            the entire Heavenly Jewel Island were actually outer disciples of the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and naturally they recognized Shangguan Fei’er, and
                                            most of them could differentiate the two Young Miss from their expressions
                                            and airs. As for Shangguan Bing’er, their Third Young Miss, she had just
                                            returned, and not many knew about her just yet.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er looked to be in a huffy, irritable mood, and she said:
                                            “Where are the members of the ZhongTian Battle Team? Call them out, I want
                                            to see them.”</p>
                                        <p>Seeing her in such a mood, the employee did not dare to question her, and
                                            quickly headed in to comply with her request.</p>
                                        <p>In moments, the eight members of the ZhongTian Battle Team had gathered at
                                            the main hall of the inn, including the youth leader who had caught the
                                            attention of Zhou Weiqing previously.</p>
                                        <p>“Second Miss, what is the matter? Who angered you?” As soon as the youth saw
                                            Shangguan Fei’er, his eyes lit up and he quickly approached her.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er gave a humph, and said: “That is none of your concern, Zhan
                                            LingTian, I need your help to do something.”</p>
                                        <p>This Zhan LingTian was naturally the leader of the ZhongTian Battle Team, and
                                            was also one of the core disciples of this generation of the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace, and he had training with the First Palace Master Shangguan
                                            Tianyang since a young age, and could be said to be one of the top few of
                                            the core disciples of their generation currently. In terms of cultivation
                                            level, he was also the cream of the crop.</p>
                                        <p>When he saw Shangguan Fei’er, he had gotten a headache. Even though Shangguan
                                            Fei’er and Shangguan Xue’er looked exactly the same, in Zhan LingTian’s
                                            heart, they were of totally different status. Since a young age, he had
                                            fallen for Shangguan Xue’er, but kept a respectful distance from the Little
                                            Devil Girl Shangguan Fei’er. Of course, seeing her here now, he could easily
                                            guess that it wouldn’t bode well for them.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er glanced at the only female member of the ZhongTian Battle
                                            Team, then turned to Zhan LingTian and said: “Zhan LingTian, let me swap
                                            with her, I want to join the Battle Team and attend the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament!”</p>
                                        <p>“Whaa??” Zhan LingTian was caught by surprise. “Second Miss, please don’t
                                            joke around with me. How can that be possible? You are of exalted rank and
                                            status, and no harm must come to you. Should anything happen to you in the
                                            finals, how can I possibly take the responsibility for that? Furthermore,
                                            there are rules to the Tournament, and it is strictly forbidden to change
                                            team members after entering the Finals. Even though we are the organisers,
                                            we cannot break our own rules.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said angrily: “Don’t talk to me about all those principles
                                            and rules. Is my power not strong enough? I do not care, I want to join!
                                            None of you really fought much in the preliminary heats, I’m sure no one
                                            will have even taken much note of the members, what’s wrong with just a
                                            quick swap. Nobody will notice!”</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Zhan LingTian had gotten a slight headache when he saw her, but
                                            looking at her stubborn expression, it now grew into a severe migraine. He
                                            was clear on how difficult it was to get this Second Miss to change her mind
                                            once she had set her sights on something.</p>
                                        <p>“Second Miss, this is a matter of principle. I’m sorry, but I definitely
                                            cannot agree to it. If you really insist on it, I will have to report to the
                                            Palace Masters.” As one of the leading disciples of the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace, he would not give in so easily.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing him bring up her father and uncle, Shangguan Fei’er knew she couldn’t
                                            continue forcing him. A mischievous look flashed in her eyes as she thought
                                            quickly, then she suddenly gave a loud sigh, saying: “Big Brother Zhan,
                                            don’t you know why I suddenly insist on joining the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian had also been curious about that, and he asked uncertainly:
                                            “Why is that?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er’s eyes reddened, and she said pitiably: “Because… because
                                            big sis was bullied…”</p>
                                        <p>“What did you say?!” Zhan LingTian exclaimed, a cold light flashing in his
                                            eyes. His stable countenance warped into a heavy killing intent, surprising
                                            even the other members of the ZhongTian Battle Team. None of them had ever
                                            seen their leader in such an enraged state.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er continued sadly: “I am speaking the truth. In the Fei Li
                                            Battle Team, there is a little rascal called Zhou Weiqing, and he was the
                                            one who brought back my Third Sis, and is also my Third Sis’ boyfriend.
                                            However, that time in the ZhongTian City Consolidating Equipment Pavilion,
                                            he mistook Big Sis for Third Sis, and kissed her without warning… he just
                                            stole away Big Sis’ first kiss like that!”</p>
                                        <p>“Big Sis actually wanted to kill him, but Third Sis appeared, and for her
                                            sake, she held back. However, I can still see that Big Sis was not happy,
                                            but with her character, you know she would never take action against that
                                            Zhou Weiqing. After all, he is Third Sis’ man! But… I won’t take it so
                                            easily, hmph, how can that fellow just steal Big Sis’ first kiss like that!
                                            Big Bro Zhan, I want to join the ZhongTian Battle Team in order to teach
                                            that rascal a lesson, to help Big Sis get some revenge. As long as we don’t
                                            kill or severely injure him, then we will be fine.”</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhan LingTian knew very well what Shangguan Fei’er’s character was
                                            like, her mischevious desire to stir up trouble notorious amongst the core
                                            disciples, but when he heard her words, he still fell for it, his eyes
                                            reddening in rage. After all, it was his idol, his love’s first kiss!</p>
                                        <p>As the saying goes, caring causes mistakes [1. Direct translation of 关心则乱,
                                            which is an idiom shortened from the saying 无欲则刚 关心则乱. Basically, you can
                                            probably get the gist of the meaning from the direct translation, but the
                                            entire thing means ‘If you have no desires, you will not be easily affected
                                            or tricked by others. Once someone cares a lot about something/someone, it
                                            is easy to make mistakes or misjudgements when the thing in question is at
                                            risk]. Even though Zhan LingTian was one of the top disciples in the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace, perhaps one of the top of his generation in the
                                            entire mainland even, but he was still no exception to that. In his heart,
                                            Shangguan Xue’er was like his goddess, and for her first kiss to be stolen
                                            by some stranger, the rage and jealousy in his heart burned fiery hot.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the fiery rage in Zhan LingTian’s eyes, Shangguan Fei’er smirked to
                                            herself inwardly. She knew that as long as she mentioned her Big Sis, she
                                            could easily manipulate this stubborn blockhead. This Zhan LingTian was so
                                            infatuated by her Big Sis, alas she did not have any reciprocal feelings for
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>“Alright! I’ll let you join!” Zhan LingTian said curtly, his words filled
                                            with killing intent.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er started, furrowing her brow, before saying in a low tone:
                                            “Big Bro Zhan, that Zhou Weiqing is hateful, but he is after all Third Sis’
                                            fiance. You can teach him a lesson, but you better not try to kill him!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian looked at her, a cold light in his eyes, but he did not say
                                            anything else, instead turning back into his room.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Consolidating Equipment Pavilion.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing sat quietly cross-legged at the entrance of the stairway to the
                                            fourth level, his eyes closed as he cultivated his Immortal Deity Technique.
                                            His emotions were still in turmoil from seeing Shangguan Bing’er earlier,
                                            and he was barely able to concentrate.</p>
                                        <p>Defeat Shangguan Xue’er, only then can you marry Bing’er. That was the
                                            condition that the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had set for him.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing did not think that just because he had barely beaten
                                            Shen Little Demon from the Blood Red Hell, that he would be able to take on
                                            Shangguan Xue’er. He had personally experienced the sheer presence she had,
                                            and the overwhelming power he could sense from her.</p>
                                        <p>Seven Jewels. Low Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master. Just her Heavenly
                                            Energy alone was more than twelve levels above his own. Furthermore,
                                            Shangguan Xue’er was from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Without even needing
                                            to verify, Zhou Weiqing was certain that she was using God Tier Consolidated
                                            Equipment, likely Legendary Sets. And unlike him or Shen Little Demon, she
                                            probably already had several pieces completed! The only advantage he would
                                            have over her would be his Elemental Jewels, but everything else he had
                                            would definitely pale in comparison, or perhaps even totally useless against
                                            her!</p>
