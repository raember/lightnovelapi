                                            saw him like that, her heart ached for him, and these two days she had
                                            stewed some meat soup which was extremely nourishing.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing had finished his closed door cultivation, the first
                                            thing he had checked on was the status and progress of the Peerless
                                            Battalion. Luckily, things had progressed close to his expectations, and the
                                            Peerless Battalion training was on the right track. Although it was still
                                            quite some distance from the true, peerless and matchless elite force in his
                                            heart, he knew it was not an easy feat to actually get to such a height, and
                                            such immense progress was already more than satisfactory.</p>
                                        <p>“Ask me to join a military conference?” Zhou Weiqing said curiously.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since the previous event, none of the Seventh Legion soldiers had dared
                                            to come provoke the Peerless Battalion, and even Shen Ji had not come
                                            looking for him since.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng nodded his head and said: “Perhaps it has something to do with the
                                            WanShou Empire armies. I have heard the rumour that this year, the WanShou
                                            Empire armies are far greater than past years, and the situation at the
                                            border is extremely tense. The higher ups in the headquarters must be
                                            contemplating whether or not to clash against them head on or to retreat to
                                            the TianBei City to hold the defense.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing furrowed his brow deeply: “Retreat to the TianBei City? How
                                            could that be possible? What about the surrounding little towns and
                                            villages, wouldn’t they be left out cold to die? Fine, I shall go to this
                                            conference then.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, Zhou Weiqing changed into his Battalion Commander armour
                                            before following Wei Feng out.</p>
                                        <p>As they exited the large tent, they bumped into a man. He was extremely large
                                            and muscular, his eyes radiating with vigour and power. The titanium mail of
                                            the Peerless Battalion allowed him to cut a dashing and valiant figure, but
                                            with a roguish brigand air about him, just like a hunting panther ready to
                                            strike at any time. His head of short, inch long black hair accentuated his
                                            manly features.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Wei Feng and Zhou Weiqing, he did not show any signs of respect,
                                            striding towards them with large steps.</p>
                                        <p>“Vice Battalion Commander Wei, this is?” The youth looked towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing with curiosity, his gaze drawn to the helmet with the yellow
                                            feathers denoting the Battalion Commander rank.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng laughed heartily and said: “Lei Zi, let me introduce you. This is
                                            our Peerless Battalion Battalion Commander Zhou. Battalion Commander, this
                                            is our new First Main Company’s Company Leader, Lei Zi. He achieved victory
                                            in the last Battalion martial Competition. Mammoth is now his vice
                                            commander.”</p>
                                        <p>“Oh? Welcome to the Peerless Battalion.” Zhou Weiqing said politely. However,
                                            in Lei Zi’s eyes, this youth who looked to be several years younger than
                                            himself actually extended his hand with an honest look on his face, to shake
                                            hands with himself, and his heart was filled with disdain. <i>This young
                                                fellow, how could he be qualified to be the Battalion Commander of the
                                                Peerless Battalion!</i></p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi grasped Zhou Weiqing’s hand, a mirthless grin on his face as he said:
                                            “Battalion Commander Zhou, I have already been with the Peerless Battalion
                                            for some time. I think your policy and rules are very well set, allowing us
                                            to be united together. However, may I know if the rules that you set also
                                            apply to yourself? If I defeat you, does that mean I can become the
                                            Battalion Commander?”</p>
                                        <p>After more than two months, the over three thousand new Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers had almost fully integrated into the entire unit. The many
                                            impressive means of the Peerless Battalion had impressed even those wild and
                                            intractable people like Lei Zi, but he was undoubtedly curious about this
                                            so-called legendary Battalion Commander Zhou Weiqing. If Zhou Weiqing was
                                            powerful enough, then he would accept it, but right in front him was such a
                                            young fellow, looking to be honest and naive. Instantly, that recalcitrant
                                            nature within him rushed out, his ruffian nature out to the core and he
                                            could not resist challenging Zhou Weiqing right at that moment.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng said solemnly: “Lei Zi, do not cause trouble. Battalion Commander
                                            Zhou has to attend a meeting at the Seventh Legion now.”</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi glanced at him dismissively. Wei Feng’s power was actually no match
                                            for him, but he had no interest in the position of Vice Battalion Commander,
                                            feeling he would rather lead a main Company of his own, which was the reason
                                            why he had not challenged Wei Feng. However, it also meant he did not fear
                                            or respect Wei Feng at all.</p>
                                        <p>Pursing his lips, he said: “Vice Battalion Commander Wei, that is not correct
                                            for you to say. Since the army rules are for everyone, then if I defeat him,
                                            I will be the Battalion Commander, and I would be the one going to the
                                            Seventh Legion meeting.”</p>
                                        <p>For the three of them to be standing in the center of the Battalion camp and
                                            speaking so loudly, several of the Peerless Battalion soldiers passing by
                                            had seen it. Naturally, they stealthily walked closer to watch. The older
                                            soldiers all knew Zhou Weiqing well, but the newer soldiers were all
                                            extremely curious. Lei Zi’s position and prestige in the Peerless Battalion
                                            was not low, especially after the Battalion Competition, and he was
                                            extremely hardworking in his training as well. Furthermore, his character
                                            was extremely valiant and he loved to fight, and he had definitely garnered
                                            much respect amongst his peers. More so, he had actually dared to do
                                            something that caused everyone to take a second look at him, actually
                                            attempting to chase after Shangguan Fei’er. Although that had resulted in
                                            him being beaten up severely, but at least he was the only one who had ever
                                            dared to do such a thing. As a result, his prestige in the entire Peerless
                                            Battalion was extremely high, especially in his own First Main Company.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the wild arrogance and obstinate look in Lei Zi’s eyes, Zhou Weiqing
                                            smiled faintly. Shaking Lei Zi’s hand, he looked to Wei Feng and said: “No
                                            problem, it shouldn’t take much time. Alright, you want to challenge me
                                            right? Very well, if you win, the Peerless Battalion Battalion Commander
                                            position is yours. However, challenging me has a price. What if you
                                            lose?”</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing spoke, the gentle smiling look of his gave Wei Feng a chill
                                            down his spine. He had been working with Zhou Weiqing for almost a year now,
                                            and he definitely understood this young Battalion Commander of his. The
                                            happier he smiled, the more honest he looked, the more evil thoughts he was
                                            up to… <i>Lei Zi ahh Lei Zi, you are asking for trouble yourself!</i></p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi gave a humph and said: “If I lose, you can deal with me however you
                                            wish.” He was originally a person who feared nothing in the heavens or
                                            earth, and he couldn’t help but think to himself: <i>Even when the chief
                                                instructor herself beat me up, I was still find. What more can you
                                                do?</i></p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded to him and smiled, saying: “Very good. Come on then.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he released Lei Zi’s hand. However, right at the instant
                                            that Zhou Weiqing loosened his grip, Lei Zi had charged forth abruptly. He
                                            did not pull back his hand, instead using it to strike upwards towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s throat.</p>
                                        <p>In order to become the ZhongTian Central Army Ruffian Battalion Battalion
                                            Commander, Lei Zi had definitely forged his own way up the ranks through
                                            fights. Although he was only thirty years old, he was already battle
                                            hardened and experienced. It could be said that after joining the army, he
                                            had earned his power and rank by clambering through the ranks of the dead
                                            powerhouses.</p>
                                        <p>His actual combat experience was just too abundant, definitely not like
                                            ordinary Heavenly Jewel Masters who might have the cultivation level but not
                                            the wherewithal to use it. He had always been chasing the fight, and as long
                                            as he could win, no matter what the method was, he would use it.</p>
                                        <p>Due to his sheer speed, even Zhou Weiqing did not have time to react, and he
                                            could only move his head slightly in an attempt to dodge Lei Zi’s
                                            strike.</p>
                                        <p>Sweeping his right hand forward, Lei Zi struck out once more at Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s neck. At the same time, his entire body of Heavenly Energy was
                                            already circulating at the max, a thick white light covering his palm. He
                                            was not using any Stored Skills, just purely Heavenly Energy. After all, the
                                            two of them were originally already at such a close distance, and with his
                                            Heavenly Energy unleashed, it almost instantaneously reached Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            neck.</p>
                                        <p>If this palm really hit, perhaps Zhou Weiqing’s head might be sliced off.
                                            Around Lei Zi’s wrist, six Icy Jade Physical Jewels shone brilliant, showing
                                            his powerful status as a six Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>However, even as Lei Zi felt his sudden attack had succeeded and was about to
                                            soften the blow slightly, he abruptly realised that his hand was suddenly
                                            unable to move. The air around his hand seemed to have coalesced into
                                            something, actually binding his hand and causing it to halt in midair.
                                            Although it was just a very simple block, Lei Zi’s Heavenly Energy was also
                                            successfully stalled by it.</p>
                                        <p>With just that short instant, Zhou Weiqing had spun around to face Lei Zi’s
                                            palm. He did not try to dodge again, instead lowering his head abruptly and
                                            slamming his forehead onto Lei Zi’s palm. At the same time, his own right
                                            hand lifted up towards Lei Zi, a bright silver light flashed out towards his
                                            face.</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi lifted his left hand, an earth shield consolidating in front of him to
                                            block Zhou Weiqing’s attack, while his right hand slammed into Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s forehead.</p>
                                        <p>*Peng**Peng* Two collision sounds rang out simultaneously. Lei Zi’s earth
                                            shield in his left hand shattered. At the same time, he felt a sudden pain
                                            from his right hand as an immense force slammed into his entire body,
                                            causing him to spin around and almost fall down.</p>
                                        <p>“Careful!” Zhou Weiqing’s voice rang out in his ears. The next moment, he saw
                                            a green blade of light, a purple-blue ball of light and a silver blade of
                                            light fly towards him from different directions. Their speeds did not seem
                                            fast, but the sheer pressure from them instantly hit Lei Zi’s entire
                                            body.</p>
                                        <p>Three Attribute Elemental Jewel? Lei Zi’s heart was filled with shock.
                                            Although he could see that Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Jewels only had five
                                            sets, one less than his own, but if Zhou Weiqing had three Attributes, then
                                            he would have many more Skills than his own. Furthermore, with just that
                                            single strike of Zhou Weiqing’s forehead on his own hand, he could sense
                                            that this young Battalion Commander’s physical strength was not to be
                                            underestimated.</p>
                                        <p>There was no time to think, and Lei Zi instantly struck the ground with the
                                            tip of his feet, his entire body lunging back in a quick retreat. Before
                                            defeating an enemy, one had to protect oneself, this was the law of survival
                                            on the battlefield. Still, Lei Zi’s retreat was not unplanned, and every
                                            time he took a step back, the previous position he was at would shoot up
                                            with an earth spike, accurately striking forth towards the three Skills that
                                            Zhou Weiqing had launched.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, to Lei Zi’s surprise, the three seemingly unassuming Skills seemed to
                                            come to live, easily dodging his earth spikes. Although their speed did not
                                            increase, not fast or slow, they still managed to continue chasing his
                                            retreating body.</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi’s had a discerning vision after all from all his battle experience,
                                            and with a look, he could easily tell that these three Skills were highly
                                            compressed. If any of them landed on him, it would definitely not be a good
                                            feeling. As such, with the stress of the three advancing Skills, he had no
                                            choice but to keep retreating.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not chase forward after him, his hands weaving out in a
                                            gesture before striking out once more, and another three bouts of lights
                                            shot forth towards Lei Zi. One was a grey whirlwind, one a dark green ball
                                            of light, and the last a twisting ball of light, forming a triangular symbol
                                            of transparent energy.</p>
                                        <p>These Skills were all unleashed directly from his hands, without any
                                            preparation time, instantly unleashed. Six Skills all at once, six different
                                            Attributes, and all six of these Skills all came flying into different
                                            directions and attacking Lei Zi from different directions. Wei Feng had been
                                            standing at the side, and all he saw was Zhou Weiqing’s fingers dancing in a
                                            rhythmetic movement, like butterflies dancing through a sea of flowers. At
                                            the same time, the six Skills were like puppets, following his instructions,
                                            constantly dodging Lei Zi’s attempts at blocking, chasing him unrelentingly
                                            and getting closer all the while.</p>
