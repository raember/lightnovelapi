                                        <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing’s emotions grew more and more excited, as he started
                                            daydreaming about the power he got. All of a sudden, his body started
                                            trembling, as a burning heat flowed from his right leg towards his entire
                                            body, and the sudden pain caused him to grunt and fall onto the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Jewels appeared around his wrists in their original
                                            form, lighting up in succession as the bright lights flashed out. Green,
                                            Blue, Silver, Black and Grey, and of course a ‘colourless’ light that
                                            couldn’t be seen. The six lights gathered above his head, forming six
                                            strange symbols, and the tiger tattoos on his body started gathering speed
                                            as they continued in their rhythmic undulations, seeming to form strange
                                            symbols as they did so.</p>
                                        <p>When Fat Cat saw this, she finally heaved a sigh of relief. Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            current state was the normal state of evolving that she knew so well.</p>
                                        <p>Two lights lit up around Fat Cat as well, purple and gold, and similarly
                                            gathering above her head. She took a step forward, coming to Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            body, allowing the two symbols of light to meet with the six around Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s head. As per what happened during her evolving, the eight lights
                                            gathered in a strange formation above them, forming a shield of light
                                            enveloping them.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst the eight lights, the purple and gold of Fat Cat, as well as the Grey
                                            and Colourless of Zhou Weiqing’s were the brightest, with their symbols the
                                            largest as well.</p>
                                        <p>As the shield formed around them, Zhou Weiqing’s body slowly returned to its
                                            normal state, the black scorpion hook of his right leg vanishing as his
                                            right leg and both arms were restored to their original states, though the
                                            tiger tattoos remained on his body, still twisting and undulating.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to Fat Cat’s evolution, Zhou Weiqing’s was much shorter, lasting
                                            only 1 day and 1 night. As the light shield vanished, Fat Cat roused
                                            first.</p>
                                        <p>When her eyes opened, a surprised delight appeared in them as she could
                                            clearly sense that there had been a marked improvement in her cultivation
                                            level. Although it could not match her own evolving, it had already given
                                            her more than three months worth of cultivating! However, Fat Cat did not
                                            realise that when she looked at Zhou Weiqing, a slight tinge of dependence
                                            flashing in her eyes.</p>
                                        <p>After she fully awoke, Fat Cat quickly turned into her small form, and Zhou
                                            Weiqing started to wake up as well at that time.</p>
                                        <p>The instant Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes, the six different colours flashed
                                            one by one in his eyes, as if bolts of swift lightning. With a shudder, he
                                            felt a slight pricking pain all over his skin. Subconsciously, he looked
                                            down, only to see that his skin was split apart almost everywhere.</p>
                                        <p>As he moved, the splitting of the skin grew more obvious, but just a surface
                                            layer. Zhou Weiqing tried touching it, and at the slightest graze of his
                                            fingers, the skin peeled aside, revealing a new layer of skin below.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to his previous skin, the fresh new layer was a few shades
                                            darker, a deep bronze filled with the sheen of health. If one looked
                                            closely, they would be able to see a special glow. Also, after further
                                            examination, Zhou Weiqing found that his physique was actually taller than
                                            before, his muscles and body even more well built, sheer power and strength
                                            flooding his body.</p>
                                        <p>The black pearl.</p>
                                        <p>The first thing that Zhou Weiqing thought of was the black pearl that had
                                            given him everything, Awakened his Heavenly Jewels. Without question, what
                                            happened to him earlier definitely had something to do with the black
                                            pearl.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, when Little Witch came looking for him, he hadn’t been very
                                            interested in their training method for the Demonic Attribute. That was
                                            because of what little he knew of his own Demonic Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>The Demonic Attribute Skill he had was not Stored from any Heavenly Beast,
                                            but had appeared on its own. Furthermore, when he had competed with Crow in
                                            physical strength, he had vaguely senses that he was close to being able to
                                            control the Demonic Change.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, his judgement was accurate. This was indeed the result of his
                                            Demonic Change, and him, evolving, thanks to the black pearl. He had even
                                            gained another Demonic Attribute Skill, and not an ordinary one from the
                                            looks of it. Furthermore, he had gained control over the Devour Skill, and
                                            also had quite an impressive improvement to his body, not just in terms of
                                            strength, but also toughness and flexibility.</p>
                                        <p>Turning his sense inwards, Zhou Weiqing realised that once again, his
                                            Heavenly Energy had reached the peak of its current stage. This time,
                                            however, he wasn’t lucky enough to have it break through automatically, if
                                            not he could possibly have reached the 14th stage of Heavenly Energy by now,
                                            or the 2nd stage of the Heavenly Shen Energy. Still, he had reached the 13th
                                            stage not long ago, and he was already at the peak; such speed was already
                                            unheard of, it had barely been half a month!</p>
                                        <p>In fact, what Zhou Weiqing did not know was that his evolving was something
                                            that would definitely happen. In fact, it should have happened when he
                                            reached the first stage of Heavenly Shen Energy. However, at that point, he
                                            had not broken through that stage on his own cultivation, but through the
                                            evolving of Fat Cat. As such, it had not been sufficient to bring about his
                                            own full evolution, though he had still benefited from that of course,.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy grew, adding to the fact he had being going
                                            all out in his training in the last week or so, it all culminated to this
                                            point when he had expended all his spirit, especially after the training of
                                            the Touch of Darkness; it had been the last spark needed to bring about his
                                            evolution. That black pearl, from another world, bringing with it the powers
                                            of that powerful beast Dark Demon God Tiger, causing his body to go through
                                            a second evolution.</p>
                                        <p>Although there wasn’t a huge increase in Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy, it
                                            was truly the evolution and improvement of his body that was striking. With
                                            his current body, both in terms of toughness and strength, it was beyond any
                                            ordinary Five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master. As for the improvement of his
                                            Demonic Attribute, Demonic Change, and addition of skills, that would only
                                            be a huge boost to his overall combat prowess, bringing it up to a whole new
                                            level.</p>
                                        <p>Stretching himself and working out the kinks in his muscles and bones, the
                                            first thing that Zhou Weiqing did was to take a nice long bath. Although he
                                            had not eaten and drank for two days, he did not feel any hunger; the
                                            peeling old skin on his body was terribly unbearable though.</p>
                                        <p>Luckily, although his scalp did peel off, all his hair remained, or it might
                                            have been a strange sight. After a good long wash, he had finally removed
                                            all the excess old skin, and cleansed, he felt fresh and new again.</p>
                                        <p>The most obvious feeling was of course that new strength that coursed through
                                            every bit of body, as if every movement he took would cause a ripple in the
                                            air.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at himself in the mirror, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but say
                                            something that he hadn’t said for a long time. “Damn, you’re looking
                                            handsome indeed!”</p>
                                        <p>This time, he was not being narcissist, at least not too much. Besides the
                                            change in his skin, his aura seemed totally different, his eyes deep and
                                            magnetic, his disposition hidden and not like the previous showy feel he
                                            once had. He had not even reached seventeen years of age, and it was
                                            definitely unusual for a person of that age to have such an aura. Along with
                                            his huge physique, he looked more mature than his actual age.</p>
                                        <p>Returning to his room and putting on a fresh set of clean clothes, only then
                                            did Zhou Weiqing feel some hunger. By this time, it was already evening, and
                                            when he ran to the dining hall for food, he found the rest of the Fei Li
                                            Battle Team having dinner as well.</p>
                                        <p>Without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing sat himself down at the table, and set down
                                            to gorging himself, giving the rest of the team a scare at how he wolfed it
                                            all down.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo examined Zhou Weiqing from top to bottom, revealing a surprised
                                            look. He was not the only one; as all the team members seemed to sense
                                            something was different about him. After all, they had all been together for
                                            a time now, and they were very familiar with Zhou Weiqing. Looking at him,
                                            with his hair still damp from his bath, his physique clearly larger, and
                                            with a different air about him, how could they not feel strange?</p>
                                        <p>Crow’s eyes lit up, as she said: “Weiqing, why do I feel like you have become
                                            more suave?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not stop eating, as he said: “Of course I’m suave and
                                            handsome, what’s new about that?” Pausing a second, he slid Crow a wary side
                                            glance before saying: “Crow, your brother here already belongs to someone,
                                            don’t have any designs on me!”</p>
                                        <p>Crow gave a humph and said: “Isn’t it common for men to have wives and
                                            concubines? Anyway, you are thinking too much, I also have a fiance
                                            already.”</p>
                                        <p>Little Four grinned and said: “Heh heh, Weiqing, don’t tell me that your
                                            Heavenly Energy cultivation level raised again?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, still chewing. In a matter of minutes, the
                                            entire table of food had been polished off, mostly by him. Lin TianAo had no
                                            choice but to order another round of food.</p>
                                        <p>After they had all finished eating, Zhou Weiqing finally heaved a sigh of
                                            satisfaction, patting his stomach and saying: “Ahhh, that hit the spot.”</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao smiled and said: “Weiqing, why are you acting like a hungry
                                            ghost? That being said, recently you have been extremely diligent! From your
                                            looks, it seems like your efforts have paid off well right?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, looking towards Crow and saying: “Come on, let’s compete
                                            strength again.” After saying that, he extended a hand to her.</p>
                                        <p>Crow started, slightly taken aback, but she subconsciously lifted her hand to
                                            his. Her hand was even larger than Zhou Weiqing’s, and as soon as their
                                            hands met, she exerted her considerable strength.</p>
                                        <p>In their previous competition of strength, she had not been fully convinced
                                            of her loss, feeling like she had not performed well. Furthermore, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had previously started with a sudden burst of power, causing her
                                            loss. As such, this time, she quickly used her full power from the start,
                                            thinking to pay him back in kind this time.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, as soon as she did so, she immediately felt that something was wrong.
                                            She felt as if Zhou Weiqing’s palm was filled with a strangely solid feel.
                                            The next moment, a huge power overwhelmed her, and before she could react,
                                            she had been lifted up from the ground totally.</p>
                                        <p>This time, Zhou Weiqing’s sleeve on his arm did not burst apart like the
                                            previous time. In fact, he did not even seem to be exerting himself, as if
                                            it was all a breeze to him.</p>
                                        <p>Releasing his hand, Zhou Weiqing placed Crow back on the ground. The members
                                            of the Fei Li Battle Team all stared at each other, shocked to the core.
                                            Crow herself had a blank look on her face. This time, she did not even know
                                            how she lost. Earlier, she had already used all her might in order to win,
                                            but when Zhou Weiqing had exerted strength, she did not even have a
                                            chance!</p>
