                                        <p>Taking a deep breath, Long Shiya forced himself to calm down, though he kept
                                            his guard up and senses extended to the max. If he sensed anything amiss, he
                                            would definitely take action first.</p>
                                        <p>As Xue AoTian sent wave after wave of Divine energy into Gu Yingbing’s body,
                                            his wounds slowly mended and his spirit also recovered slightly. However, he
                                            eyes were currently filled with a conflicted expression. Without question,
                                            he had lost at this last round of the test. Up until now, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            still withstanding the pressure. Furthermore, when Zhou Weiqing had actually
                                            entered the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, he had already left the suppression
                                            area and clearly sensed it. Power aside, the patience and thought behind
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s actions caused Gu Yingbing to be filled with alarm.</p>
                                        <p>There were still two more competitions ahead, and as his Master had said,
                                            Zhou Weiqing had to defeat him in all three before he could claim victory.
                                            Currently, Gu Yingbing truly wanted to know what the contents of the next
                                            two tests were, and the one he hoped for most was a direct confrontational
                                            clash with Zhou Weiqing. Only then did he feel that he could grasp victory
                                            in his hands. After all, in terms of cultivation level, he was still so far
                                            ahead of Zhou Weiqing, almost an insurmountable gap between them. No matter
                                            how powerful and pure his bloodline was, he would not be able to fully bring
                                            it into play in an actual fight.</p>
                                        <p>If those were the terms of fighting, Gu Yingbing was still confident in his
                                            own victory.</p>
                                        <p>Just as the others were still nervously lost in their own thoughts, all of a
                                            sudden, the entropic barrier dissipated. The Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia
                                            had already disappeared, leaving on Zhou Weiqing sitting there cross-legged
                                            in a meditative position.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing was sitting there with his eyes closed, his face
                                            peaceful. The Dragon-Tiger Transformation had already vanished, though his
                                            upper body was naked, showing his solid bronzed muscles.</p>
                                        <p>Without Phelia’s shield covering Zhou Weiqing, Long Shiya could instantly
                                            sense his condition. Seeing his disciple was fine, he heaved a sigh of
                                            relief.</p>
                                        <p>Turning his gaze to Xue AoTian, he said: “Old Monster Xue, the outcome of
                                            this first test is very clear right, you should proclaim it now.”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian nodded his head and said: “Very well, as you all have seen, the
                                            first round of overwhelming with aura, the results are out. Zhou Weiqing has
                                            lasted longer in the tenth round, so he is the victor of the overall
                                            competition. I will give you both another two hours to rest and recover
                                            before we start on the next test.”</p>
                                        <p>Towards Xue AoTian’s proclamation, the Lion King Gu Site was not able to say
                                            anything. The outcome had been very clear to everyone’s eyes, and if he
                                            tried to argue it would be beneath his status. Furthermore, there were still
                                            two more rounds. However, his feelings were no longer as relaxed as they had
                                            been earlier. Zhou Weiqing’s showing had proved that he could be of actual
                                            threat to Gu Yingbing.</p>
                                        <p>“Mountain Lord, while bloodline and aura suppression is important, actual
                                            combat is the most important to any Heavenly Jewel Master. For the second
                                            test, shouldn’t they compete in actual combat?” Gu Site asked Xue AoTian
                                            curiously. His thinking was the same as Gu Yingbing, that it would be faster
                                            and more direct to just defeat Zhou Weiqing in a face to face clash.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing had the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor as his Master, Gu
                                            Yingbing also had the strongest powerhouse in the entire world as his
                                            Master, the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord. Even if their fighting skills were
                                            similar, or with Zhou Weiqing’s slightly higher, but the difference in
                                            cultivation level was too huge that no amount of talent or skills could
                                            overcome. Actual combat was very different from aura suppression and
                                            overwhelming after all.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian nodded and said: “That is correct. The second test is actual
                                            combat.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing those words, Gu Site finally smiled once more. Long Shiya did not say
                                            anything; he knew that since he dared to bring Zhou Weiqing here, there was
                                            no avoiding some fighting. Towards Zhou Weiqing, this would be his most
                                            difficult test, and the most important as well. If he wanted to go home with
                                            his girl, he had to pass this round as well, otherwise everything else was
                                            false.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Long Shiya was not sure whether or not Zhou Weiqing could succeed,
                                            but he wanted to give his precious disciple a chance. After all, one could
                                            lose a fight, it was just a matter of your skill being below your opponent
                                            for now, and he had the confidence he could still bring his disciple back
                                            down safely. Having the courage to fight for yourself was the most important
                                            thing. In any case, at least from the way things were going, it was still
                                            relatively smooth sailing. However, this next test would be a critical point
                                            ahead.</p>
                                        <p>Time passed, minute after minute. No one else knew what had happened between
                                            Zhou Weiqing and the Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia in the last round, but
                                            they could all sense that his Heavenly Energy was still brimming. Sitting
                                            there cross legged, it seemed like like he had already recovered from the
                                            previous test, perhaps just some fatigue in terms of spirit.</p>
                                        <p>The bloodline of Dragon and Tiger… was this bloodline of that unknown black
                                            tiger fused with the Solidified Dragon Spirit so strong? Even the Entropic
                                            Nether Tiger was not able to fully suppress him. That only meant one thing -
                                            just in terms of bloodline quality alone, Zhou Weiqing’s bloodline was
                                            already above that of the Entropic Nether Tiger, and naturally that also
                                            meant that it was superior to both the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger and
                                            Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion bloodlines. One could imagine what a
                                            shocking news that was! Towards Zhou Weiqing, all the powerhouses present
                                            had a fresh recognition towards him.</p>
                                        <p>Two hours passed very quickly. Previously when Xue AoTian was speaking out
                                            the time for their rest, both Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing could clearly
                                            hear it. Although Gu Yingbing was injured, his spirit somewhat damaged by
                                            the invasion of the entropic field, but under Xue AoTian’s healing and the
                                            two hours of rest, he had pretty much recovered back to his prime state.</p>
                                        <p>Gu Yingbing stood up once more. Currently, this Lion Prince was once again
                                            filled with a powerful fighting intent. He had not expected to lose the
                                            first round, but he would not allow himself to lose again this time.
                                            Otherwise, even if he finally won the third test, he would not be able to
                                            live with himself as it would be an overall loss in his eyes. How could he
                                            live up to his name as the Lion Prince? Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing was more
                                            than ten years younger than he was! If he could still lose, then in the near
                                            future as that fellow grew stronger, could he have a chance?</p>
                                        <p>Filled with all sorts of complicated thoughts, Gu Yingbing’s fighting spirit
                                            was fuelled to the maximum.</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, Zhou Weiqing had slowly gotten up from the floor. His eyes
                                            had returned to their normal black colour, looking as if he was totally
                                            fine, and he had not just been aura suppressed by the Entropic Nether
                                            Tiger.</p>
                                        <p>However, the one most familiar with Zhou Weiqing, Long Shiya, could tell from
                                            the details that Zhou Weiqing’s eyes had some changes. An additional calm
                                            and tranquility, and a hint of joy within as well. Seeing that, Long Shiya
                                            finally relaxed. With Zhou Weiqing’s intelligence and wit, he would not be
                                            taken advantage of so easily, and if he had been, then he would not have
                                            such a look in his eyes. It was clear that the future mother in law had
                                            given him some benefits. Furthermore, he could judge from it that the one
                                            Phelia had chosen was clearly Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Although this was the first time Long Shiya had met Old Monster Xue’s wife,
                                            he could just imagine how much feelings Xue AoTian must have for her. Twenty
                                            years apart! Without question, Phelia would have a great influence on him,
                                            and if this future mother-in-law had approved of Zhou Weiqing, then his
                                            chances would increase greatly.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian motioned Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing to come before him. As they
                                            did so, Xue AoTian said solemnly: “The first test was on your personal
                                            potential and bloodline power.”</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou Weiqing is the victor for the first test, but there are two more tests
                                            to go. Now, for the second competition, it will a test of your actual
                                            fighting capabilities. If either of you want to marry my daughter, you will
                                            need to have the ability to protect her.”</p>
                                        <p>“This fight will not between the two of you. After all, you are more than ten
                                            years apart in terms of age, and your cultivation level gap is large too. If
                                            it is just a fight between the two of you, then it will be too unfair to
                                            Zhou Weiqing.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Xue AoTian’s words, the Lion King Gu Site was anxious. Taking a
                                            hurried step forward, he said: “Mountain Lord, that isn’t good right?
                                            Although his age is younger, he was the one who came here to snatch the
                                            bride. You said it yourself earlier, Yingbing deserves to have an advantage
                                            right.”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian’s face darkened. “Lion King, do you think that my disciple is not
                                            able to win a fight under fair circumstances?”</p>
                                        <p>Although Gu Site was the King of the WanShou Empire, and his character had
                                            always been strong, in front of Xue AoTian he dared not be too impetuous.
                                            His face changed several times, before he sighed softly and said: “As the
                                            Mountain Lord instructs.”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian continued passively: “This second test, Bro Long, you and the Lion
                                            King will be participating. For fairness sake, you will each be testing Zhou
                                            Weiqing and Gu Yingbing. Bro Long, you will be testing Yingbing, the Lion
                                            King will test Zhou Weiqing. In this way, there will not be any
                                            unfairness.”</p>
                                        <p>The Lion King Gu Site was still having a vexed look on his face a moment ago,
                                            but he started upon hearing that, and joy replaced it. He thought to
                                            himself: “The heavens are with me. Hmph, for this King to take care of that
                                            little brat, won’t it be a simple task?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya’s expression grew ugly. Although he did not think that Gu Yingbing
                                            could defend against himself for long, but with Zhou Weiqing at the
                                            six-Jeweled cultivation level, it was even worse for him against the Lion
                                            King Gu Site! How could they possibly compete like that?”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian said: “My words are not done, both of you do not need to be so
                                            anxious. In order to properly test their power, I will be binding both your
                                            powers. I will use a Sealing Skill to restrict your Heavenly Energy… once
                                            the Heavenly Energy you use goes beyond my Seal, then it will be breaking
                                            the rules, and that means the disciple or son of your side will be
                                            considered to have lost. If that does not happen, then whoever loses first
                                            between Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing will have lost the fight.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, Long Shiya’s expression settled. “Old Monster Xue, to what
                                            levels will you be restricting our cultivation level during the fight
                                            then?”</p>
                                        <p></p>
