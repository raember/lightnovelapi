                                            bloodline power was also being awakened and merged… the strange black pearl
                                            that he had once swallowed.</p>
                                        <p>No one could guess what would be the final result, but at least now Zhou
                                            Weiqing was safe, and he did not need to worry about the pain or breaking
                                            down from it. As for what would happen eventually, even he did not know. He
                                            could only hold down the fort in his mind’s core, keeping it clear and
                                            protected as possible. In doing so, he could only sense the heat around him,
                                            and not know much about the changes in his own body.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Long Shiya finally relaxed. He knew that this transformation
                                            of Zhou Weiqing’s would be a long process, and even his own prior estimate
                                            of forty nine days may not be accurate. However, he did not worry any
                                            longer, instead feeling a strong sense of anticipation and hope. This
                                            precious disciple of his… if he not only Awakened his Solidified Dragon
                                            Spirit, but also that unique bloodline power of his, what would happen to
                                            him? He wouldn’t become a little monster right?</p>
                                        <p>As he thought up to that point, Long Shiya’s mouth curved up in a faint
                                            smile. He did not leave, instead looking for a spot in the area that wasn’t
                                            covered in magma before sitting down to cultivate.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>North Border, Northwest Camp. Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>The WanShou Empire had already started taking action once more. However, this
                                            time, it was not just any ordinary sneak attacks. A dozen WanShou Empire
                                            Legions were advancing in neat formation towards the ZhongTian Northwest
                                            Army Camp. Alas, all of the Northwest Army Scouts that had been sent out had
                                            all been caught and slain.</p>
                                        <p>The WanShou Empire armies did not advance quickly. In a few days that they
                                            had been moving, they had only moved a few dozen li per day before
                                            stopping.</p>
                                        <p>It had already been eight days since the competition between the Peerless
                                            Battalion and the Heavy Infantry Regiment. At this point, currently, the
                                            watchtowers of the Northwest Army Camp could already spot the slowly
                                            advancing lines of the WanShou Empire armies far off in the distance. The
                                            battle was nigh.</p>
                                        <p>The advancement of the WanShou Empire was definitely with some plan in mind,
                                            and as they did so in such a constricting fashion, the atmosphere within the
                                            Northwest Army camp grew more oppressive as the days passed. No one knew
                                            when the WanShou Empire armies would choose to actually attack, and thus the
                                            entire Northwest army had to keep in a constant high alert and preparation
                                            mode all the time. In such a circumstance, no matter generals, officers or
                                            ordinary soldiers, all of them were left in an exhausted state, both mind
                                            and body. This was the true goal of the WanShou Empire. They were confident
                                            that the ZhongTian Empire Northwest Armies would not dare to take the
                                            initiative against them especially on the plains, and they could easily use
                                            such psychological warfare against the Northwest Armies to affect their
                                            energy and morale. When the WanShou Empire finally launched their attack, it
                                            would undoubtedly be a lightning swift one to take down their enemies as
                                            quickly as possible.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to the rest of the Northwest Armies, the atmosphere in the
                                            Peerless Battalion was a stark contrast. For them, all they had to do was to
                                            continue their daily routine of training. Of course, the only difference was
                                            that the Peerless Battalion did not train alone anymore, but along with the
                                            Heavy Infantry Regiment, as both had to integrate their training to properly
                                            fight together.</p>
                                        <p>These past few days, Oni had been truly feeling rather vexed and depressed.
                                            His Heavy Infantry Regiment that he was so proud of had actually lost to the
                                            Peerless Battalion in the area they were the most confident in, even with a
                                            numbers advantage. Without even considering how much money they had all
                                            lost, just that sheer humiliation of that loss was unprecedented for the
                                            entire Heavy Infantry Regiment. After that fight, one could say that the
                                            morale of the entire Heavy Infantry Regiment had sunk down to its lowest
                                            ever.</p>
                                        <p>However, orders were orders, and they were still sent to camp together with
                                            the Peerless Battalion. More so, Shen Ji had given them the order that Oni
                                            and his Heavy Infantry Regiment would be under the command structure of the
                                            Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Still, the integrated training was going on rather well. On the side of the
                                            Peerless Battalion, their requirements were rather simple - two Heavy
                                            Infantry soldiers to a single Peerless Battalion soldier in tandem, and with
                                            their Tower Shields protecting the front and air, it would ensure that the
                                            Peerless Battalion soldiers would not have any chance of being hit by enemy
                                            archers.</p>
                                        <p>Such a tactic of cooperation was definitely not difficult, and the one Heavy
                                            Infantry soldier in charge of defending the front had the easier task, just
                                            needing to position his Tower Shield to cover all their bodies, and did not
                                            even require much effort. As for the one covering the top, he only needed to
                                            lift his tower shield to do so, and with the two Heavy Infantry soldiers
                                            taking turns and swapping when required, the integration of fighting for
                                            these powerful Heavy Infantry soldiers known for their physical strength was
                                            indeed an easy task.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Peerless Battalion soldiers, it was even easier, as they could
                                            just practice their archery under such protection. Under the cover of the
                                            Heavy Infantry soldiers, it was without question that the safety of the
                                            Peerless Battalion soldiers was highly guaranteed even in the heat of
                                            battle, and correspondingly their offense as well.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Zhou Weiqing had arranged it as such on the precaution that the
                                            Peerless Battalion meet any enemies far beyond anything they could not
                                            handle on the battlefield. In that case, the Peerless Battalion soldiers
                                            could quickly retreat. Of course, in that case, the Heavy Infantry Regiment
                                            would not be able to retreat in time due to their lack of speed, and would
                                            be forced to cover their retreat. Naturally, this was a worst case scenario
                                            that would only be used as an absolute last resort.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, all the Peerless Battalion soldiers were extremely satisfied by
                                            such an arrangement. Although Zhou Weiqing did not appear frequently before
                                            them, but this young Battalion Commander of theirs had definitely earned all
                                            their respect, not the least with his unique thinking and how it showed his
                                            concern for all their safety.</p>
                                        <p>This training lasted for five days before the dejected morale of the Heavy
                                            Infantry Regiment finally showed some change...</p>
                                        <p>The reason for the change was simple… they no longer felt anger and hate for
                                            the Peerless Battalion, instead full of envy and jealousy.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the reason of that was clear - due to their training together, the
                                            two troops were camped together, but their supplies and logistics were all
                                            separate… for example, their meals.</p>
                                        <p>In just the matter of a few mere meals, the Heavy Infantry Regiment soldiers
                                            was already unable to stand it.</p>
                                        <p>In the Seventh Legion, the Heavy Infantry Regiment was considered one of the
                                            top elites, and their treatment was definitely the best amongst the entire
                                            Legion, and their food was also top quality, considering. However, when it
                                            was compared with the Peerless Battalion, the Heavy Infantry soldiers almost
                                            wanted to cry.</p>
                                        <p>On the side of the Heavy Infantry Regiment side, for their three meals a day,
                                            one was at least with meat. This was already considered an extremely good
                                            treatment in the army, and it was to ensure their combat effectiveness.</p>
                                        <p>Yet, what were the Peerless Battalion soldiers eating?!</p>
                                        <p>For them, each and every one of their soldiers ate six meals everyday. That
                                            was right. Six meals.</p>
                                        <p>Their schedule was as such. Early in the morning, they would awake and gather
                                            before having their breakfast. This would be the first meal, usually milk or
                                            soya bean milk, with each drinking a large bowl of it. Next,, each would
                                            have four eggs, green vegetables and lean meat, sometimes even a bit of
                                            cheese.</p>
                                        <p>After their meal, they would rest for an hour before their vigorous training
                                            would start, lasting an hour. Another hour of rest before another snack.
                                            Although it was just a small snack, it was usually with meat… sometimes even
                                            with expensive Heavenly Beast meat.</p>
                                        <p>When it came to lunch, this third ‘meal’ of the day was the most substantial
                                            and sumptuous one. All of them got at least six dishes, with meat, meat soup
                                            or at least stewed with bones; with all six meals being relatively different
                                            everyday.</p>
                                        <p>With the two troops camped so close to one another, just the sweet fragrance
                                            of meat almost covered the entire Heavy Infantry Regiment. As the Heavy
                                            Infantry soldiers ate their simple and homogeneous food, that feeling was as
                                            if they were chewing on wax.</p>
                                        <p>For the afternoon training, the Peerless Battalion soldier’s fourth afternoon
                                            snack was mostly fresh fruits and vegetables. Sometimes, for convenience
                                            sake, it was just barrels and barrels of fresh fruit juice, warm and
                                            delicious.</p>
                                        <p>Dinner was simpler than lunch, but it was still meat soup, but mostly with
                                            medicines and herbs, filled with ginseng, deer horn and various other
                                            tonics, herbs good for the body, and the smell of this was even more
                                            temptingly delicious.</p>
                                        <p>Every night, an hour before they slept, the Peerless Battalion would have
                                            their sixth meal of the day, supper. After that, they would chat a while
                                            between themselves before they had a good sleep. Their tents were all lined
                                            with beast leather and furs, and inside their armour, they would always have
                                            fresh and clean cotton inline clothes.</p>
                                        <p>When some of the Heavy Infantry soldiers inquired more into the matter about
                                            how the Peerless Battalion were getting so much good food, they realised
                                            that every day, the Peerless Battalion had specialised people purchasing
                                            large amount of supplies from the TianBei City, with at least a thousand
                                            people hired to support them. They did not even eat any of the supplies from
                                            the Seventh Legion.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Seventh Legion Army Headquarters.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss… this will not do… if this continues, I will not have any men left to
                                            lead…. What kind of lives are those Peerless Battalion punks living?! The
                                            food you eat, it’s lots better than even what you eat! Ordinary soldiers…
                                            having six meals a day! How do you think my brothers feel when they see
                                            that!”</p>
                                        <p>Oni exclaimed huffily towards Shen Ji.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji looked at him exasperatedly and said: “What do you want me to do? Get
                                            your boys the same food as them? Do you know how much money the Peerless
                                            Battalion spends every day? I dispatched some men to investigate previously…
                                            and they spend around ten thousand gold a day just on their food alone. That
                                            is to say… almost two gold coins or more for a single soldier. How can we
                                            compare to that? You know how much our pay and provisions are every
                                            month…”</p>
                                        <p>Oni gave a helpless look and said: “Boss… how about recalling us from that
                                            duty then… I…”</p>
                                        <p>“No.” Shen Ji said firmly. We already lost the fight and the bet, we cannot
                                            lose our honour and integrity as well. Ask your brothers to endure for a
                                            while more… the war will be starting soon, and once the fighting starts, I
                                            expect that they will not be able to enjoy themselves and eat like that any
                                            longer. Once the annual fight against the WanShou Empire is over, I will be
                                            able to recall your Regiment from this duty. During this period of time, I
                                            can only trouble you to help persuade them and work on their ideology…”</p>
                                        <p>Oni gave a deep sigh and said: “Alright, I guess that is the only choice now.
                                            However, those Peerless Battalion bastards are just too shameless. Everyday,
                                            they have remnant food and they actually feed it to their horses instead,
                                            hmph, not even thinking about giving us some of it. And they dare give the
                                            excuse that they do not want to humiliate their allies. Dammit I feel like
                                            slapping them hard!”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji said solemnly: “Don’t just look at their benefits and how well they
                                            are eating. Haven’t you observed their training at all? Every day, their
                                            training is like pitting their hearts and lives. It is as if they do not
                                            care about exhaustion, and even their sparring within their own ranks is
                                            going all out. Their training is more than three times that of our elite
                                            forces…”</p>
                                        <p>Oni gave a bitter smile and said: “How could I not know that? But… look at
                                            what they are eating! In the evening, they even have medicinal soups and
                                            tonics, all their energy expenditure will be easily replenished. Damn, Boss,
                                            do you know what I was thinking? I was thinking why I didn’t commit any
                                            mistakes in the past and never got sent to the Ruffian Battalions. Their
                                            lives are just too good, better than even nobles! Furthermore, the money
                                            they are spending... splurging on... it is the money they have won from
                                            us!!”</p>
