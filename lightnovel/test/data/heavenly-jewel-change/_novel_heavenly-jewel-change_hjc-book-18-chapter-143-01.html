                                            just not sufficient, I have been too impatient, reaching far above my means.
                                            Furthermore, now that the Blood Red Hell members have clashed with us, and
                                            we need to report this back to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace immediately, and
                                            let them decide on a solution. Bro Zhan, what do you think?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s last question showed his respect for Zhan LingTian, and as
                                            soon as he heard that he felt much more comfortable. After the past few
                                            days, Zhou Weiqing had revised his opinion of the arrogant young man. Though
                                            that fellow was undoubtedly extremely proud and arrogant, and rather focused
                                            on wanting face, he was not a bad person. Just from how he was able to step
                                            forward bravely in a time of danger, that was enough to cover his other
                                            faults.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian nodded and said: “This time, the Blood Red Hell was the one who
                                            betrayed their own word, also disregarding the honour of our Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace. We do have to send word back about this as soon as possible.
                                            I agree with Weiqing, we should return to his Peerless Battalion before
                                            returning to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace immediately.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er pursed her lips in dissatisfaction before saying: “Fine… I
                                            originally wanted to go play around in the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, you
                                            guys are so boring. The first time we meet some problems, you just shrink
                                            back.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, that ‘shrink’ word, well done.” [1.
                                            Innuendo ;) you know what can shrink heh]</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er blushed suddenly, giving him a punch on his shoulder. “You
                                            just barely escaped death, and you can’t control your mouth again. As a
                                            matter of fact, I have to say your luck is unbelievably good. Do you know
                                            who the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor is? He is one of the top Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters in the entire world, even more senior than my father or big
                                            uncle. His power is truly unfathomable, and in the Heavenly Emperor Stage,
                                            he is unparalleled.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Well, I don’t know about that, but
                                            my teacher has already left. After some time, he will come to the Peerless
                                            Battalion to look for me.” He only explained things simply; after all this
                                            was the secret history of the Legacy of Strength, and he did not wish to
                                            spread it in detail.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian said: “In that case, let us head back then.”</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, eight Snow Deer Tribesmen walked forth, each carrying
                                            different sorts of delicious looking food. The one in front was an old man,
                                            looking to be about sixty to seventy years of age. He bowed down
                                            respectfully towards them and said: “Honoured guests, greetings to you.
                                            Since you are all friends of Great Ancestor, no matter what, you should have
                                            a nice meal here at our Snow Deer Tribe before leaving, otherwise Great
                                            Ancestor will blame us.”</p>
                                        <p>After the events of the evening, the group were rather hungry. Furthermore,
                                            in such a biting weather, looking at the piping hot, delicious food, if they
                                            could just ignore it like that, they would not be human.</p>
                                        <p>Besides Shangguan Fei’er, all of them were large and stout, especially Ma Qun
                                            and Crow, the two champion appetites were tantamount to that of three
                                            ordinary men. Looking at the delicious spread before them, deer milk, fried
                                            biscuits, bread, barbequed meats, it was a true feat that they managed to
                                            keep themselves from drooling.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Alright, thank you all so much. We will leave after
                                            eating then.” In the first place, he had planned to discuss the possibility
                                            of purchasing some mounts from the Snow Deer Tribe, so this was a good
                                            opportunity for him. Since their previous tents had been totally destroyed
                                            by Han Tianyou, the Snow Deer Tribe led the group to another larger, more
                                            luxurious tent. It was lined with soft fur, causing the entire tent to be
                                            warm.</p>
                                        <p>The Snow Deer Tribe food definitely was a unique local flavour, although
                                            rather heavy, it was filled with a wild fragrance, and they all enjoyed the
                                            delicious cuisine. Even Zhan LingTian and Shangguan Fei’er who had eaten
                                            many delicious foods in their time couldn’t help but eat with gusto.
                                            Especially the slightly sweet deer milk was unique but delicious, increasing
                                            their appetite drastically while sending a comfortable warmth throughout
                                            their bodies in a nourishing way.</p>
                                        <p>As they ate, they quickly learned that the old man was the current Tribe
                                            Leader of the Snow Deer Tribe. Although he was rather respectful and polite,
                                            the Heavenly Energy reverberations around his body was definitely not
                                            weak.</p>
                                        <p>The old man was very respectful towards Zhou Weiqing, and he clearly knew
                                            about the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor taking him as disciple.</p>
                                        <p>“Elder, has your Snow Deer Tribe always lived here?” Zhou Weiqing asked the
                                            old man.</p>
                                        <p>The old man answered with a hint of fear in his voice: “Please do not call me
                                            elder, my name is Yi Erhan, please call my name directly. In terms of
                                            seniority, you are one generation senior to myself. In the past, my
                                            grandfather served the Great Ancestor, and if not for him, our Snow Deer
                                            Tribe would have been wiped out long ago.”</p>
                                        <p>“Oh. In that case, I’ll call you by your name directly, you can also call me
                                            by my name. I am Zhou Weiqing.” Zhou Weiqing was not overly polite, as he
                                            knew how important such seniority matters were. Modesty was a virtue, but
                                            overdoing it was just being false. Especially since he was now the Six
                                            Ultimate Heavenly Emperor’s disciple, and he could not let his teacher lose
                                            face.</p>
                                        <p>“In that case, this old man will comply deferentially rather than decline
                                            courteously. Mr Zhou, we Snow Deer Tribe are nomadic in nature, though we
                                            rear these Snow Deer, the totems of our tribe. In truth, this camp here is
                                            just a mere portion of our entire Tribe. The main reason we stay here at
                                            this time is to seize the opportunity when there is no war to earn some
                                            money from the human traders who take the trading route, to aid our entire
                                            tribe in survival.”</p>
                                        <p>“In the vast plains of the WanShou Empire, our Snow Deer Tribe is merely a
                                            tiny one, barely ten thousand strong. Compared to the larger tribes like the
                                            Wolfmen Tribe, Tigermen Tribe, or the Lionmen Tribe, we cannot compare at
                                            all. Furthermore, after so many years of wars, many of our tribesmen were
                                            drafted for war. Although our death toll was not high, our numbers have
                                            never been high, and several times we have came close to being wiped out.
                                            Luckily, our Great Ancestor asked the Heavenly Snow Mountain to spare us
                                            from drafting, and the great Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord personally allowed
                                            it. That gave our Snow Deer Tribe a chance to recuperate and rebuild up our
                                            strength, to do some small business in the borders.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Yi Erhan’s words, Zhou Weiqing’s heart stirred. It looked like his
                                            teacher did have some connection with the Heavenly Snow Mountain after all,
                                            even knowing the Legendary Top Powerhouse in the entire mainland.</p>
                                        <p>“I see, so that is why… Well, could I ask if your Snow Deer are available for
                                            sale?” Zhou Weiqing asked tentatively.</p>
                                        <p>Yi Erhan started at that question, before shaking his head with an apologetic
                                            look on his face. “I’m afraid not. Unfortunately, the Snow Deer are our
                                            totems, and they are the ones who have given us life and everything, how
                                            could we possibly trade them? The Snow Deer are our guardian deities, and
                                            when we meet any enemies, our finest warriors will mount the Snow Deer to
                                            charge through their formations.”</p>
                                        <p>“Ahh, I see. No problem.” Zhou Weiqing nodded his head with some
                                            disappointment. Of course, he would not force such a thing.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the disappointed look in Zhou Weiqing’s face, the Snow Deer Tribe
                                            Leader felt some fear. All this while, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had
                                            been their greatest benefactor, yet he had never asked them for anything. In
                                            truth, with Long Shiya’s power and status, besides providing him with food
                                            and comfort, they could not really offer him anything.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Long Shiya, who had always been alone, had finally managed to
                                            get a disciple, and he had finally a request. Wasn’t this the perfect
                                            opportunity to repay the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and stay in his good
                                            books?</p>
                                        <p>“Mr Zhou, could I ask why you are looking to buy the Snow Deer?” Yi Erhan
                                            asked tentatively.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “I have a troop of soldiers at the
                                            other side of the border. Since I’ve heard so much about the strength, build
                                            and speed of your Snow Deer friends, I originally wanted to purchase some
                                            for my soldiers as mounts. They would be extremely useful in future
                                            battles.”</p>
                                        <p>Yi Erhan furrowed his brow, silent. Selling the Snow Deer was naturally
                                            impossible, as it was the most important of their tribal laws. Furthermore,
                                            even if he agreed to the request, his own tribesmen would rebel against
                                            it.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing had not had much hopes that this would succeed, and he
                                            had only been trying his luck in asking. Seeing that Yi Erhan remained
                                            silent, he quickly headed back to the table to snatch more food to eat.
                                            Snatch was indeed the right word to use here, as in just the short period of
                                            time he had been speaking with Yi Erhan, the other members had been gorging
                                            on the food. If Zhou Weiqing had been any slower, it would have been likely
                                            he did not have anything left to eat.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued eating comfortably, enjoying himself. However, Yi
                                            Erhan was in a dilemma; after all, such a chance was indeed hard to come by,
                                            yet it was just too difficult to accomplish.</p>
                                        <p>After a few minutes of silence, it was as if he had suddenly set his resolve,
                                            and he abruptly looked up towards Zhou Weiqing and said: “Mr Zhou, as you
                                            said, our Snow Deer Tribe’s Snow Deers are indeed extremely powerful, even
                                            in a one versus one fight, against the tiger or panther steeds, we still
                                            have confidence to fight with them. However, our Snow Deer can only be
                                            ridden by our Snow Deer Tribesmen, and even for us, we need to individually
                                            gain their approval and respect before we can do so, and to become our great
                                            Snow Deer Cavalry Warriors. How about this instead, if you have any
                                            requirements in future, you can send in a request. As long as the fight is
                                            not against our WanShou Empire, I can lend you five hundred Snow Deer
                                            Cavalry Warriors. When the fight is over, you can just let them come
                                            back.”</p>
                                        <p><i>What? There was even such a good deal? </i>As soon as Zhou Weiqing heard
                                            the offer, he was extremely delighted. Without even needing to train these
                                            soldiers and he would be able to gain a troop of five hundred powerful Snow
                                            Deer Cavalry Warriors? That was unbelievably great news!</p>
                                        <p>Yi Erhan thought that Zhou Weiqing’s silence meant he thought it was too
                                            little, and he said with a slightly pained tone: “Mr Zhou, our entire tribe
                                            only consists about ten thousand in population, and only those finest
                                            warriors and elites will be able to become Snow Deer Cavalry Warriors. In
                                            our entire army, the Snow Deer Cavalry Warriors only number about a
                                            thousand, and we will need to keep some around to deter any possible enemy
                                            incursions. Sending out five hundred of them is already our absolute
                                            maximum.”</p>
                                        <p>“Oh! I do not think it is too little at all, I am extremely happy with that.”
                                            Zhou Weiqing said hastily. “Tribe Leader Yi Erhan, thank you so much for
                                            that. Do not worry, even if I do need your help in the future, I will not
                                            use your Snow Deer Cavalry Warriors for nothing. I will pay a good fee as
                                            well as food, we’ll count it as I am hiring your Snow Deer Cavalry Warriors.
                                            How does that sound?”</p>
                                        <p>Yi Erhan did not reject Zhou Weiqing’s suggestion. After all, the Snow Deer
                                            Tribe was a small tribe, and their Snow Deer Cavalry Warriors were highly
                                            sought after by many of the stronger tribes. If not for the fact that the
                                            Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had ascended the Heavenly Snow Mountain on
                                            their behalf, their Snow Deer Tribe might have been swallowed up by a larger
                                            tribe by now.</p>

                                        <p><em>Tang Tang (his daughter) is sick with pneumonia, and she is on the drip.
                                            Yet, at this time, I suddenly saw that I have dropped far below on the
                                            monthly vote. Could this be the legendary ‘Joy comes never more than once

                                            which is closer to the hospital where she needs to be on the drip. After
                                            this post, I will go to see her again, before coming back to write some
                                            more. I will not miss tonight’s post as well, as promised I will rush out
                                            another release before going back to see Tang Tang.</em></p>

                                            All this while, my wife has paid a heavy price for my sake, and it is only
                                            because of her support that I can continue writing stably. Now that our

                                            only ask that, brothers and sisters of the Tang Clan, could you allow me to
                                            relax and take care of them, to pay back all the support they have given me
                                            all this while, and I can leave the monthly vote roll to you? Thank
