                                        <p>At this point, it showed the true difference between the WanShou Empire and
                                            the ZhongTian Empire. Without question, the WanShou Empire had powerful
                                            beastmen warriors with terrifying personal power. In terms of ordinary
                                            soldiers, the ZhongTian Empire might need at least ten to face off against
                                            one of the WanShou Empire’s soldiers to be able to hold their own. However,
                                            in terms of the higher ranked powerhouses, it was totally different.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of numbers of Heavenly Jewel Masters, the WanShou Empire was
                                            actually only slightly less than the ZhongTian Empire. However, in terms of
                                            quality, it was quite a major difference. The greatest reason came from
                                            Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills.</p>
                                        <p>Just like all other Empires, Consolidating Equipment Masters were an
                                            extremely rare commodity in the WanShou Empire. On the other hand, with the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island as their backbone, especially the Consolidating
                                            Equipment Pavilion there, the ZhongTian Empire had an advantage that no
                                            other Empire held.</p>
                                        <p>This Butler was already a nine-Jeweled powerhouse, but he could only unleash
                                            seven Consolidated Equipment at once. More importantly, they were not Sets
                                            at all, just seven loose pieces. The best one was the heavy spiked mace in
                                            his hands, a Zong Stage Consolidated Equipment. As for his other six, there
                                            were even High Level Consolidated Equipment, and a Mid Level Consolidated
                                            Equipment, with only two Grandmaster Consolidated Equipment that was still
                                            relatively decent. Unleashing seven Consolidated Equipment at once might
                                            seem scary, but in truth, their boost to Butler was not too huge, especially
                                            considering his current level.</p>
                                        <p>“Who are you…” Butler shouted out loud. Facing a Heavenly Skill Image, he was
                                            no fool, how could he possibly charge forward without thought. Alas, the
                                            Heavenly Skill Image also caused him to totally neglect Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            age.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a cold laugh and said: “I am the Peerless Battalion
                                            Battalion Commander, Zhou Weiqing. Remember my name…” A killing intent
                                            flashed in his eyes. Seeing that his opponent did not come to him, Zhou
                                            Weiqing charged forward towards Butler instead. At this moment, his Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal was already fully prepared and ready to strike at any
                                            instant. He would not allow the same thing that had happened to him during
                                            the fight against Han Tianyou to happen again for this fight he had prepared
                                            for so long.</p>
                                        <p>A ferocious light flashed in Butler’s eyes. He was after all the Regiment
                                            Commander of the Swift Wolf Regiment, and at this point his bloodlust and
                                            ferocity was fully evoked. Forcing his gold war wolf mount forward, he
                                            charged forth to face Zhou Weiqing head on.</p>
                                        <p>However, at the same time, the Swift Wolf Regiment who were behind Butler had
                                            run into great trouble.</p>
                                        <p>Butler had charged forth all by himself towards Zhou Weiqing, and not long
                                            after he had done so, the rest of the Swift Wolf Regiment had only reached
                                            about one hundred and fifty yards from the Peerless Battalion formation. The
                                            war wolf mounts began to lose their balance, stumbling as they fell into
                                            traps, large trenches that had been prepared and set beforehand.</p>
                                        <p>With an Earth Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master like Lin TianAo on their side,
                                            it was an easy task to open a wide trench like that, especially with the
                                            help of over a thousand Peerless Battalion Soldiers. That was the reason why
                                            Zhou Weiqing had chosen this place to hold their ground and fight. It would
                                            also allow the Swift Wolf Regiment to see their low numbers and in such a
                                            case, they would not split their forces and just attack head on.</p>
                                        <p>The trenches were about thirty metres wide, and even with the war wolf
                                            mounts’ powerful leaping capabilities, they would not be able to jump
                                            across. The depth of the trenches was only six metres, but they were filled
                                            with many ‘surprises’. For example, many sharp spikes, brimstone, dried
                                            grass, fire oils and other easily flammable substances.</p>
                                        <p>The over one hundred officers of the Swift Wolf Regiment were Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters, with Company Commanders around two to three Jeweled cultivation
                                            level, Battalion Commanders around four to five Jeweled cultivation level.
                                            Alas, they had the same problem with the lack of Consolidated Equipment. The
                                            hundred or so of them were charging in a single row in order to block the
                                            arrows from the front, using their Heavenly Energy. As a result, by the time
                                            they had reached the trenches, the few hidden soldiers below just needed to
                                            release the trapdoors to unleash the full power of the trap.</p>
                                        <p>Over a hundred officers fell into the trap instantly.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why Zhou Weiqing had allowed Butler to come to him without setting
                                            off the traps was simple. With Butler’s power, the trench would be totally
                                            useless to him, and he could help his officers out easily. It would be much
                                            better to let him through and fight him head on, which would also have the
                                            added benefit of increasing the morale of his Peerless Battalion troops at
                                            the same time.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng had already calculated the distance, and at the same moment that the
                                            enemy officers crashed down into the trap, he had already given the
                                            order.</p>
                                        <p>The thirty six Fire Attribute Elemental Jewel Masters shot out the arrow they
                                            had prepared for this time… a titanium alloy full arrow imbued with the
                                            Explosive Fireball. They did not have any Consolidated Bows to help them, so
                                            their Explosive Fireball would start burning the Titanium Arrows. This was
                                            the reason why the trap had to be set at a one hundred and fifty yard
                                            distance, not any further. After all, that was the distance that their fire
                                            arrows could be sustained at an accurate measure.</p>
                                        <p>The war wolves of the officers were definitely of the highest quality, and
                                            even as they fell into the traps, they still managed to somewhat maintain
                                            their balance. Their defensive capabilities were also pretty decent with
                                            their tough fur, but no matter what they would not be able to fight against
                                            the physics of gravity and inertia.</p>
                                        <p>In a short period of time, the trench was filled with pained cries and shrill
                                            screams. Although not many of the Swift Wolf Regiment officers were actually
                                            injured, most of their war wolf mounts had died from the sharp spikes, or
                                            were heavily injured. Some luckier ones who had avoided the spikes still had
                                            their bones broken from the fall.</p>
                                        <p>These officers were old hands on the battlefield, and even with such a sudden
                                            blow to them, they knew better than to attempt to save their beloved war
                                            wolf mounts. They all knew that staying in the trap would possibly mean
                                            their deaths. Let alone what their enemies could do, their own men would be
                                            charging forth soon, and at such speeds, they would not be able to stop in
                                            time. If they fell on top of them, even as Heavenly Jewel Masters, these
                                            officers would not enjoy such treatment.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, just as they were preparing to react, the well prepared thirty six
                                            Explosive Fireball arrows struck down with precise accuracy into the
                                            trap.</p>
                                        <p>A whole series of explosions, and flames blazed high up into the air. The
                                            flammable and explosive materials in the trap were overabundant, especially
                                            with brimstone and fire oil added together, increasing the spread of fire
                                            and burning. Ignited by the powerful Explosive Fireballs, with loud booms, a
                                            wall of flame rose up across the entire trench, even reaching seven or eight
                                            metres tall.</p>
                                        <p>Some of the faster officers still managed to jump out in time, but there were
                                            those slower ones who had either been knocked back down into the trench by
                                            the Explosive Fireball arrows, or were just swallowed by the rising flames
                                            as they tried to jump.</p>
                                        <p>Those Battalion Commanders were still able to use their Heavenly Energy to
                                            barely protect themselves, but the Company Leaders were not so lucky. Their
                                            Heavenly Energy was not strong enough to protect them from such an onslaught
                                            of flames, and as the saying goes, the elements have no mercy upon mankind.
                                            In that instant, over twenty of the officers were swallowed up by the flames
                                            and perished. Even those surviving officers had lost all their war wolf
                                            mounts.</p>
                                        <p>This fire trap was just too perfect, and this plan was not from Zhou Weiqing,
                                            but from Mu En. In terms of sly cunning, who could compare to this God Eye
                                            Scoundrel?</p>
                                        <p>The true reason of the fire was not to kill the officers, but to cause them
                                            to lose all their war wolves. Towards the unique charging formation of the
                                            Swift Wolf Regiment, the Peerless Battalion officers had already witnessed
                                            it for themselves so many times, and it was all part of their plan. In order
                                            to block their arrows, they knew their enemies would definitely make use of
                                            this formation once more. With this fire, those strongest officers had now
                                            lost their greatest asset - their speed. Furthermore, this trap and fire
                                            wall would also slow down the remaining Wolf Cavalry soldiers behind. After
                                            all, they would not be able to vault across such a wide trench of thirty
                                            metres, and they could only pass around.</p>
                                        <p>This would give the Peerless Battalion soldiers time to retreat.</p>
                                        <p>“Retreat…” Hua Feng’s order came without hesitation, following their plan to
                                            the letter. His orders did not include the eighty ‘special forces’.
                                            Previously, they had been saving their strength, and this was their time to
                                            explode with all their might. Their task was not just to snipe down as many
                                            officers as they could, but also to cover their comrades’ retreat.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion did not have many warhorses, but their running speed
                                            was not to be underestimated. Following Hua Feng’s shouted orders, all of
                                            them turned to run without hesitation, springing towards the hills where
                                            their ‘home’ had been. As for the seven Heavenly Bow Unit masters, they
                                            continued waiting there silently with the special forces unit. They were not
                                            in a rush to retreat; after all, they all had warhorses as mounts. Although
                                            not all were Ghost Demon Horses, it would not be a problem for them to
                                            retreat easily.</p>
                                        <p>Without a doubt, the combination of trench and fire wall had disrupted the
                                            steadfast charge of the Swift Wolf Regiment, causing some chaos amongst the
                                            ranks. At least a few dozen wolf cavalry soldiers on the second row had been
                                            charging too quickly, and they had not been able to stop in time, falling
                                            down into the trench trap as well. Sadly for them, they did not have the
                                            same power as their officers, and it was instant death for these ordinary
                                            wolf cavalry soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>Butler had been separated from his troops by the trench at his back, and as
                                            the wall of flame rose, the fight between him and Zhou Weiqing finally
                                            started.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing pounced towards Butler, and in midair, he did something that
                                            Butler could not understand. With the power of his right leg, Zhou Weiqing
                                            had jumped up high, but Butler did not see any weapons in his hands, instead
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s right foot came crashing down upon him.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing had spent the last six months training in the Six
                                            Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, it would take him a far higher cultivation
                                            level to be able to use it to unleash a greater power. As such, in terms of
                                            current actual combat, his fighting style was not very different from
                                            previously, just that his control over Heavenly Energy and his own Stored
                                            Skills had been greatly improved, and he would not waste a single drop of
                                            Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p><i>Is this little brat crazy? He’s actually trying to attack me with his
                                            leg? </i>That was Butler’s exact thought at the moment. After all, he was
                                            currently holding a massive 2.2 metre long spiked mace, the thickest portion
                                            on top even thicker than his own thigh and covered with a layer of
                                            terrifying looking sharp spikes. Even a thick block of steel would be
                                            smashed apart by his spiked mace, let alone Zhou Weiqing’s mere flesh and
                                            bone.</p>
