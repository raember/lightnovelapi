                                            Dragon Set, they had the ability to fight against a Max Level Heavenly God.
                                            On the other hand, the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell did not have
                                            any more Heavenly Gods on their side. Who was able to stop Dongfang Hanyue’s
                                            attacks? </p>
                                        <p>Under extreme helplessness, the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley had
                                            dispatched forty Heavenly Emperors to surround Dongfang Hanyue and attack
                                            her from all directions. Only then did the speed of her Dragon Spear
                                            reduce. </p>
                                        <p> “Kill——” Dongfang Hanyue’s appearance had greatly decreased the pressure
                                            placed on Xue AoTian. He no longer had to put in all his effort and might to
                                            resist against the Destruction Celestial Territory. The Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain Lord could finally participate in the battle by attacking the
                                            enemy.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of the headcount, they had less than a hundred people on their side,
                                            whereas their enemy still had nearly 400 powerhouses. However, they had
                                            three Heavenly Gods - the battle was no longer tilted to one side. It was
                                            still hard to determine which side was going to emerge victorious. However,
                                            due to the terrifying destructive power of Dongfang Hanyue’s Dragon Spear,
                                            victory was leaning towards the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless
                                            Sect. </p>
                                        <p>In the previous Grand Tournament, Xue AoTian was the only Heavenly God. But
                                            this time? Just within the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain itself, there
                                            were more than ten Heavenly Gods! </p>
                                        <p>The battlefield on this side had stabilized. On the other side, the battle
                                            between the Shangguan brothers, who were leading the Heavenly Spirits and
                                            Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum Formation, and Huang Xingyun and his
                                            wife, Yun Ruoyu, was in full swing. </p>
                                        <p>In terms of cultivation base, Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyu had the absolute
                                            upper hand. However, the current situation on the battlefield said otherwise
                                            - they were on the losing end. </p>
                                        <p>For the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum Formation to
                                            be considered as the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s trump card, how could it be
                                            that easy to be dealt with? Without the presence of a Heavenly God to lead
                                            them, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace still managed to be the number one Saint
                                            Land for the past couple of years. It was definitely not because of sheer
                                            luck. </p>
                                        <p>The moment the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum
                                            Formation had been unleashed, it made Huang Xingyun and his wife feel as
                                            though they became a pure, whole entity. Regardless of where they attacked
                                            or ran to, they were greeted by the combined energy and power of all 108
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace powerhouses.</p>
                                        <p>The Shangguan brothers, Tianyang and Tianyue, were the central “eyes” of the
                                            Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum Formation. The
                                            Destruction Celestial Territory had no effect within the formation. This was
                                            also one of the unique characteristic of the formation - disabling any
                                            effects of Celestial Territories.</p>
                                        <p>Even though it was true that Heavenly Gods were powerful, Huang Xingyun and
                                            Yun Ruoyu’s own attacks were weakened by half as a result of the formation.
                                            Thereafter, the power of their attacks were equally split amongst the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace powerhouses, who were able to rely on the profound
                                            nature of the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum
                                            Formation to dissolve their attacks with ease. </p>
                                        <p>The formation did not directly attack Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyu, and yet…
                                            every single time the faint white mist swept past them, they felt as though
                                            their lives were threatened, forcing them to mobilize their Heavenly Energy
                                            at full capacity to counter it. </p>
                                        <p>High Level Heavenly God powerhouses presently had the highest status in the
                                            world. Even so, there was still a limit to the Heavenly Energy that they
                                            possessed. Continuous draining of their Heavenly Energy would constantly
                                            weaken their cultivation base. Since the Heaven’s Expanse Palace powerhouses
                                            were using the Heavenly Spirit and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum
                                            Formation to create a fantastic energy circulation, each individual’s energy
                                            drain would be far less than Huang Xingyun and his wife. </p>
                                        <p>If Huang Xingyun could make a choice all over again, he would have rather
                                            gone to fight against Zhou Weiqing instead of being trapped within the
                                            Heavenly Spirit and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum Formation. It felt
                                            too painful to be unable to fully use his power. Furthermore, even if he
                                            wanted to escape, it was impossible for him to do so. Within the vast misty
                                            formation, he was unable to charge out of it - even with his will. Hence, he
                                            was also unable to sense what was happening in the external world.</p>
                                        <p><em>I don’t think that the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends Boundless
                                            Infinitum Formation that Xue AoTian was faced with in the past was as
                                            powerful as the current one, right?</em> Huang Xingyun lamented in his
                                            heart, and was filled with hatred. He could only hope that the other battles
                                            would end as quickly as possible, so they could go over to lend him a
                                            helping hand. Even though he and his wife were unable to break out of the
                                            formation, he could sense that the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends
                                            Boundless Infinitum Formation was already at its limit when faced with their
                                            joint attacks. As long as another Heavenly God was roped in to support them,
                                            they would definitely be able to break out of the formation. </p>
                                        <p>Huang Xingyun still had a rather accurate judgment of the current state of
                                            affairs on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. From what he could tell,
                                            their people had the absolute upper hand in at least two of the battles.</p>
                                        <p>One of which was the battle where the main forces on both sides were fighting
                                            head on - in terms of numerical strength and attributes, they had the upper
                                            hand. He believed that the battle would end within a short period of time.
                                            The other battle was naturally the one Fen Tian was in. Huang Xingyun knew
                                            Fen Tian’s strength and abilities very well. A Max Level Heavenly God could
                                            easily kill off the Peerless Sect fellow within a short period of time. By
                                            then, as long as Fen Tian gave him a helping hand, then naturally, his
                                            battle would end within the shortest time possible. </p>
                                        <p> “Xingyun, we need to conserve some of our Heavenly Energy,” Yun Ruoyu’s
                                            voice rang in Huang Xingyun’s ear. </p>
                                        <p>Huang Xingyun nodded. The husband and wife held hands, as the distorted
                                            Darkness light continuously orbited around their bodies. Even though they
                                            were trapped within the formation and hence were unable to absorb the
                                            attributes’ energy from the external world, given their high cultivation
                                            base, the Heavenly Energy generated from the bodies could sustain them for a
                                            very long period of time. </p>
                                        <p>The two brothers, Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue, were calmly observing Huang
                                            Xingyun and his wife. Seeing them take on a defensive stance, the brothers
                                            could not help but smile. </p>
                                        <p>They knew the essence of the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends Boundless
                                            Infinitum Formation best. In a way, this formation was almost perfect -
                                            regardless of where the enemy attacked from, the formation could not be
                                            broken, unless the opponent’s power was three times stronger than the
                                            combined power of everyone supporting the formation. Within the formation,
                                            all laws were rendered ineffective, and Celestial Territories could not be
                                            used either. </p>
                                        <p>However, the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum
                                            Formation had a weakness - its offensive power was insufficient. Based on
                                            Huang Xingyun and his wife’s powers, even if they had no defense mechanism
                                            put in place, the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum
                                            Formation would still be unable to harm them. If that was truly the case,
                                            the situation would have been reversed - sustaining the formation would
                                            cause them to drain a large amount of energy after all. If Huang Xingyun and
                                            his wife were able to hold out, ultimately, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace
                                            powerhouses would be the ones to fully drain their Heavenly Energy. </p>
                                        <p>It might be easy to say that, but under the threat of losing one’s life at
                                            any moment within the formation, nobody would dare to forgo their defense
                                            mechanisms, allowing them to attack freely. Furthermore, this weakness was
                                            aimed specifically at the Heavenly Gods. Huang Xingyun and his wife still
                                            did not have the courage to abandon their defense. Hence, it was destined
                                            that the battle over here would be a very long one. It also looked the
                                            calmest compared to the other ongoing battles. </p>
                                        <p>At this moment, both battles on the ground had regained the state of
                                            equilibrium. However, the three battles in the sky were completely
                                            different. </p>
                                        <p>The word ‘spectacular’ could be used to describe the battle between the Six
                                            Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya and the Blood Red Hell Deputy Hell Lord
                                            Shen Mo. </p>
                                        <p>In terms of cultivation base on the whole, Shen Mo had a slight upper hand.
                                            However, in terms of the control over the Heavenly Energy, it was apparent
                                            that Long Shiya had the upper hand. If they had chosen to continue battling
                                            in their initial fight, both of them would have ended up fatally
                                            injured. </p>
                                        <p>However, they did not choose to continue fighting - instead, they had chosen
                                            to stop in the middle of their fight. This time, they would be competing
                                            based on the energy restored during the period of time when they were
                                            resting. </p>
                                        <p>Once again, Long Shiya’s huge figure metamorphosed in the sky. However, this
                                            time, it was only a hundred meters in height. Even though his Heavenly
                                            Energy became a lot richer, it still could not be compared to the massive
                                            figure he had before. </p>
                                        <p>On the other hand, on Shen Mo’s side, the enormous devouring mouth appeared
                                            again. It continuously launched frenzied attacks towards Long Shiya. Shen Mo
                                            hated the Peerless Sect people to the core - even Shen Bu got killed off by
                                            Zhou Weiqing; it was something that he could never accept. </p>
                                        <p>They were both Heavenly Gods - naturally, they both have an accurate
                                            understanding pertaining to their battle earlier. Shen Mo knew his current
                                            condition very well. Even though he was injured and thus affecting his
                                            cultivation base, but from what he knew, Long Shiya should be more severely
                                            affected. This was due to the fact that Long Shiya had drained too much of
                                            his will, and it was harder for will to be restored, compared to the healing
                                            of injuries. Within such a short period of time, it was impossible for Long
                                            Shiya to make any substantial recovery. This was clearly seen within the
                                            battle - it was evident that Long Shiya’s will could only control a hundred
                                            meter tall figure at the moment. </p>
                                        <p>The moment any of the five ongoing battles had an outcome, it would affect
                                            the overall situation. Shen Mo was a lot more optimistic compared to Huang
                                            Xingyun, because in his eyes, they had the upper hand in every single
                                            battle, apart from the one between the Sidhe and the two enormous dragons.
                                            What he wanted to do right now was to kill off Long Shiya, whose will was
                                            lacking, in the shortest time possible, before going on a killing spree.
                                            Only bloodshed could get rid of the rage in his heart. </p>
                                        <p>Everything that was happening at the moment seemed to be developing in the
                                            direction that he wanted - under his powerful attack, Long Shiya was
                                            completely unable to launch any effective counterattack, and this was after
                                            the Destruction Celestial Territory was being subdued yb the Sidhe’s Nature
                                            Celestial Territory. Dealing with Long Shiya’s completely passive defense
                                            stance, Shen Mo launched unbridled attacks on all fronts. Every single time
                                            a part of Long Shiya’s hundred meter tall figure’s energy got ripped out by
                                            Shen Mo, it would shrink a little. It was a matter of time before Shen Mo
                                            defeated him. </p>
                                        <p>The area in the sky occupied by the battle between the Sidhe and the two
                                            enormous dragons was the greatest. The Sidhe Empress became the main
                                            restrictive power within the formation. </p>
                                        <p>Even though the Nature Celestial Territory Formation set up by the twelve
                                            elders was able to restrain Hui Yao and Duo Si, these two enormous dragons
                                            were too powerful and strong - especially after they had possessed the
                                            Destruction Attribute. It had caused their attacks to become extremely
                                            terrifying. Hui Yao’s cultivation base was even higher than that of Fen
                                            Tian’s.</p>
                                        <p>If it were truly up to them to attack at full force, the formation would not
                                            be able to bind them. </p>
                                        <p>From the looks of it, the Sidhe might have five Heavenly Gods on their side,
                                            but in truth, the four elders had only broken through to the Heavenly God
                                            Stage a while back. Without the Sidhe Empress, Hui Yao alone could easily
                                            defeat them all.</p>
                                        <p>However, the present Sidhe were no longer as weak as they used to be when
                                            they were living in seclusion within their sealed grounds. With the
                                            evolution of the Sidhe Ancient Tree, as well as the Sidhe Queen’s evolution
                                            to the Sidhe Empress, they were not easy targets at all. </p>
                                        <p>In ancient times, the Sidhe Empress was as equally renowned as the Dragon
                                            Emperor! </p>
