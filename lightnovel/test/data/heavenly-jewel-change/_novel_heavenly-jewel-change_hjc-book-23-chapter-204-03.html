                                            they actually retreated to recover and try again, wouldn’t that mean an even
                                            greater loss? As such, the Kalise Empire commander had given the death
                                            order. No matter what the cost, they had to take the Crescent City
                                            today!</p>
                                        <p>In a full scale, mass battle, Zhou Weiqing’s combat effectiveness was
                                            definitely terrifying. No one would believe he was just a six-Jeweled
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master from all he had done.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that for the entire section of the wall, nearly a third of
                                            it was covered by Zhou Weiqing alone. The dual Legendary Hammers in his
                                            hands were like cannon turrets, constantly spitting out large amounts of
                                            lightning pearls, which spread out to knock down countless of enemies.</p>
                                        <p>With the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, Zhou Weiqing could maintain such
                                            attacks for a long time, but the Kalise army would not give him the chance
                                            to keep doing so. In that moment, more than a dozen figures appeared on the
                                            city walls like the wind, all directed at Zhou Weiqing. All of them could
                                            tell how important Zhou Weiqing was to the Heavenly Bow Empire, and as long
                                            as they could kill him, there would be no longer any suspense about the
                                            outcome of the war. Even if they could not kill him, they could at least
                                            prevent him from attacking their ordinary troops.</p>
                                        <p>When the over dozen figures appeared on the city walls, the pressure the
                                            frontal wall was under increased greatly. The reason was simple, the Bai Da
                                            Regiment had finally joined the battle. They had treated the Kalise soldiers
                                            like cannon fodder, and now that they had reached the city walls, they had
                                            also begun their own attacks.</p>
                                        <p>Although the Bai Da Regiment had lost their Heavy Cavalry soldiers and a
                                            large number of Heavy Infantry soldiers, their ordinary infantry soldiers’
                                            fighting capabilities were already far beyond that of the Kalise Empire
                                            soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>Even for their ordinary light infantry soldiers, these Bai Da Empire fighters
                                            had a full set of leather equipment and helmet, even their left hands had a
                                            small round shield buckled on.</p>
                                        <p>This allowed them to have a greater survivability on the battlefield, not to
                                            mention their better training. Furthermore, the officers of the Bai Da
                                            Empire were all Jewel Masters, and for their Company Leaders and above, they
                                            had to be at least a two-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master or higher. Battalion
                                            Commanders and above had to be Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p>
                                        <p>With these powerhouses joining the fight, the pressure the Peerless Regiment
                                            faced instantly increased.</p>
                                        <p>Firstly, the fresh recruits of the Heavenly Bow Empire were being injured or
                                            even killed rapidly. Although they had been given basic training, and with
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s actions and words inspiring them to bloodlust and they were
                                            just giving it their all, but they were still fresh recruits with no real
                                            combat experience. Unfortunately, facing the crazed onslaught of their
                                            enemies, these fresh recruits were the first to perish.</p>
                                        <p>On the frontal wall, there were only a total of a thousand fresh recruits,
                                            and under such a circumstance, the injury and death toll began to rise. Only
                                            those luckier ones who were right beside the Peerless Regiment warriors were
                                            saved.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the rest of the Peerless Regiment soldiers also showed their
                                            considerable fighting abilities.</p>
                                        <p>By now, the two hundred Peerless Regiment archers had morphed into close
                                            combat fighters. Not long after this bloody battle began, they started to
                                            truly feel so much gratitude for their beloved drillmaster Shanggaun Fei’er.
                                            It was her merciless training and spurring that had given them their current
                                            skill in hand to hand combat.</p>
                                        <p>All of the Peerless Regiment soldiers were dressed in titanium mail, light,
                                            flexible but extremely tough. Ordinary arrows, swords and sabres could not
                                            harm them easily. This allowed them to fight on without too many
                                            distractions. Furthermore, all of them were Jewel Masters. To be able to
                                            enter the First Main Company, they were at least four-Jeweled Physical Jewel
                                            Masters or higher. Even if a lot of their Heavenly Energy had been expended
                                            earlier with their Consolidated Wings and Consolidated Bows, as Jewel
                                            Masters their physique, physical attributes and even toughness were far
                                            beyond any ordinary soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>In the hands of the Peerless Regiment soldiers, the long spears thrust,
                                            pierced, flick, dodged, all the various simple yet effective techniques
                                            working wonders in their hands. Even for the Bai Da Empire soldiers, none
                                            could last around them. Almost every time they took action, the Peerless
                                            Regiment soldiers could severely injure or kill an enemy, and already a
                                            large number of enemy troops had been sent off the wall.</p>
                                        <p>Melee combat had barely started for more than fifteen minutes, and the
                                            Peerless Regiment soldiers, including the Heavy Cavalry soldiers were all
                                            drenched in blood. However, none of them were injured yet, and they even had
                                            to intervene or take blows to protect the fresh recruits beside them. It was
                                            their powerful presence and performance that kept the Crescent City from
                                            falling there and then.</p>
                                        <p>Without a doubt, the pressure that Zhou Weiqing was under was the greatest.
                                            Lin TianAo and Xiao Yan had both been dispatched by him to protect the other
                                            sides of their wall. Currently, more than a dozen Bai Da Empire Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters were surrounding Zhou Weiqing on his side of the wall. This
                                            was a war, not an arena fight, and there was no such thing as being ‘fair’
                                            on the battlefield. As soon as these Heavenly Jewel Masters appeared atop
                                            the wall, they instantly surrounded Zhou Weiqing and began attacking crazily
                                            together.</p>
                                        <p>*BANG*</p>
                                        <p>The crying-face hammer savagely smashed one of the Bai Da Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters into meat paste, but at the same time, Zhou Weiqing had took take
                                            blows from two enemies at his back.</p>
                                        <p>With the wings behind his back, Zhou Weiqing’s speed was extremely fast.
                                            However, amongst the surrounding Bai Da Empire Heavenly Jewel Masters, two
                                            of them were at the eight-Jeweled cultivation level, while the rest were at
                                            least four Jewel or higher, with some six and seven Jeweled respectively.
                                            This force gathered together was definitely a formidable one.</p>
                                        <p>Despite his speed and agility, Zhou Weiqing could not dodge everything and
                                            still go on the offensive. As such, he had done his best, accepting the hits
                                            from the weakest four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters, while forcefully
                                            killing one of the six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Zhou Weiqing’s tremendous physique and constitution proved its
                                            true use in actual combat.</p>
                                        <p>As the two four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters struck Zhou Weiqing, they felt
                                            as if his body was just like a tough and flexible rubber. Not only did their
                                            attacks seem to lose strength immediately, there was a return
                                            counter-force.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing’s body was surrounded by lightning, and his Dual
                                            Legendary Hammers continued to constantly spit out large amounts of
                                            lightning pearls which spread out in the area, causing the Bai Da Empire
                                            powerhouses to have to react to them. This barely allowed him to hold his on
                                            for now, but Zhou Weiqing had definitely been contained by his foes, and
                                            would not be able to affect the rest of the battle.</p>
                                        <p>More and more enemies climbed up the walls, and the stacks of corpses piled
                                            up there was already so much that there was barely space for more to
                                            stand.</p>
                                        <p>The Bai Da and Kalise soldiers that climbed up the walls after were forced to
                                            actually clear some of their fallen comrades before they could continue
                                            fighting.</p>
                                        <p>The intensity and viciousness of the fight far surpassed the expectations on
                                            both sides. For Zhou Weiqing’s side, he had never imagined that the Kalise
                                            Empire would be so resolute in their efforts to take down the Crescent City,
                                            and to bring so many forces into play now. There were no probing attacks or
                                            exploratory moves like he had expected, instead this all-in attack with more
                                            than fifty thousand soldiers. The sheer amount of resources and powerhouses
                                            channeled into this was astonishing. Although Zhou Weiqing knew that the
                                            frontal assault was the toughest, he could imagine that the other three
                                            walls were also facing their own uphill battles.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, there was no time for regrets, nor was there any meaning in
                                            doing so. All they could do was to fight, to put everything on the line and
                                            fight. There was no chance left to retreat, as everyone was full of
                                            bloodlust. Now, it was kill or be killed.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Kalise Empire side, they had never imagined that this tiny force
                                            of Heavenly Bow Empire soldiers would actually cause them so much trouble,
                                            so many casualties. Unlike the various other Heavenly Bow rebellions that
                                            they had quelled, the Peerless Regiment’s terrifying combat abilities had
                                            just caused them far too much death and losses.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>The battle raged on from dawn all the way to high noon, and the city walls
                                            were bathed in a river of blood.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Regiment soldiers were still hanging on. However, even their
                                            titanium mail was mostly in tatters, not a single piece of their armour was
                                            fully intact. Although their wounds were not serious, the remaining fresh
                                            recruits by their side had dropped drastically.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the death toll on their enemies were far greater, and none of the
                                            Peerless Regiment soldiers actually knew how many they had killed. All they
                                            could see before them was a spread of blood red.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Regiment soldiers might have the best training, the best
                                            equipment, being powerful Jewel Masters… but they were still human, not
                                            machines. They could still feel exhausted; by now all the Heavenly Energy in
                                            their bodies had long been used up. Even for the Berserker and Gold Crow
                                            Tribe warriors, with their powerful physiques and constitutions, they were
                                            barely even able to hold their massive weapons any longer. Luckily, their
                                            armour was just too thick and strong, for the moment no matter how their
                                            enemies struck at them, they were unable to break through their defense;
                                            otherwise they might have already suffered casualties.</p>
                                        <p>After these several hours of fighting, there were still seven powerhouse
                                            enemies surrounding Zhou Weiqing. They were the strongest of all the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters who had come from the Bai Da Empire. All of the
                                            others had died to the Dual Legendary Hammers. With his own six-Jeweled
                                            cultivation level, to have done so much up until now, that was already close
                                            to the limit for Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>The Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was indeed powerful, especially in
                                            terms of sustainability. Even so, an entire morning of constant high
                                            pressure fighting had pushed Zhou Weiqing’s body to the limit.</p>
                                        <p>By now, he couldn’t even maintain the Dragon-Tiger Transformation. All about
                                            his body, where the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set did not cover,
                                            countless wounds covered him. If not for the fact his constitution was so
                                            strong, with the bloodlines of the dragon and tigers mixed within him,
                                            perhaps he would have fallen by now.</p>
                                        <p><i>No! I can’t fall here. I mustn’t fall here! </i>At this point, all that
                                            held Zhou Weiqing up was his own willpower. He was no longer able to use any
                                            Skills, just using the strength that was brought to him by the ‘Hate Ground
                                            no Handle’ Legendary Set to keep fighting… fighting. He was extremely clear
                                            that if he fell down now, then the war would be over, and all would be lost.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>He had long since witnessed many of his Peerless Regiment soldiers wounded,
                                            but these soldiers who had come from the Ruffian Battalion had a strong
                                            sense of survival, able to cover and protect each other as best they could.
                                            All of the injured Peerless Regiment soldiers gathered together in a
                                            defensive bunch. Zhou Weiqing did not know if any of them had died, or if
                                            so, how many. However, he could see that barely a third of them were still
                                            able to continue fighting.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Berserker and Gold Crow Tribe warriors, they were now just
                                            resorting to using their weight to shove enemies down the walls. Most of
                                            them could not even lift their weapons anymore, let alone fight.</p>
                                        <p>For a battle to reach such an intense, horrifying state, one could use the
                                            word ‘meat-grinder’ to describe it.</p>
