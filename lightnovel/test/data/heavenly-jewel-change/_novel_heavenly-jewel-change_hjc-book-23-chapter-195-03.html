                                            be?!</p>
                                        <p>The Berserker Tribe soldiers were indeed all carrying an extra-large spiked
                                            mace. That novel weapon was even heavier than Crow’s Legendary Axes. Of
                                            course, the Gold Crow Tribes had their heavy battle axes in hand as
                                            well.</p>
                                        <p>Both sides had not even clashed, and in terms of aura and presence, the
                                            Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers had already fully suppressed their
                                            enemies.</p>
                                        <p>Almost in the next instant, the Heavy Cavalry soldiers of both sides smashed
                                            savagely into each other.</p>
                                        <p>Crow and Ma Qun were right in the front of their respective troops, and
                                            naturally they were the first to slam into their foes. A terrifying sight
                                            ensued immediately.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Quns twin huge spiked maces moved simply, but directly. Sweeping in front
                                            of him, he totally ignored the heavy lances that the two Kalise Empire Heavy
                                            Cavalry soldiers had pointed at him.</p>
                                        <p>In the entire Boundless Mainland, all Heavy Cavalry soldiers were normally
                                            outfitted with heavy lances as their weapons. For the Kalise Empire
                                            soldiers, their heavy lances were almost four metres long, as thick as a
                                            normal human’s arm. Only the strongest elite could be chosen to become Heavy
                                            Cavalry soldiers, because only they were able to hold these lances while
                                            charging. When charging, the weight and momentum of such a weapon, along
                                            with their strength, this was the reason why Heavy Cavalry soldiers had such
                                            destructive powers that no other type of soldiers could compare to.</p>
                                        <p>Such a pity that the current enemy they were facing were also Heavy Cavalry
                                            soldiers… the Peerless Heavy Cavalry! The two heavy lances slammed into Ma
                                            Qun’s chest, but their owners could not feel excited or happy at all. Their
                                            usual unstoppable charge was instead halted, and they felt as if they had
                                            slammed into a giant hill, the force of impact actually forcefully stopping
                                            their charge. Their mounts actually continued running forward, but their
                                            bodies had been lifted off their mounts, pushed off with their own heavy
                                            lances!</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, Ma Qun’s spiked maces struck. *Bam**Bam* The first
                                            spiked mace slammed into the heavy lances, actually breaking both in that
                                            single blow. The next spiked mace slammed into the chests of the two Kalise
                                            Heavy Cavalry soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>Like two tin cans being smashed, the Kalise Heavy Cavalry soldiers’ armour
                                            totally caved in. Following that came the creaking sound of the armour
                                            breaking apart and blood gushed out of all the gaps of the armour. Like two
                                            cannonballs, the two corpses slammed to the side, each knocking over another
                                            Heavy Cavalry soldier.</p>
                                        <p>A similar sight duplicated itself for every single one of the Berserker Tribe
                                            members. With their defensive capabilities, they totally ignored the
                                            ineffectual attacks of their foes, as they sent their enemies on a free trip
                                            to heaven instantly.</p>
                                        <p>The Gold Crow Tribe’s attacks was a different beast altogether. Crow was not
                                            far from Ma Qun as she slammed into the enemy formation. On her end, she did
                                            not allow her enemies to strike at her at will, instead the Legendary Axes
                                            in her hands striking out in two directions. A single swipe of the first axe
                                            cleaved apart the heavy lances striking at her, while the swipe of the
                                            second axe flashed across the two Heavy Cavalry soldiers facing her,
                                            instantly leaving two lower bodies that had lost their top half.</p>
                                        <p>If one had to use a phrase to describe the sight of the two Heavy Cavalry
                                            forces slamming into each other, then perhaps ‘a massacre with flesh and
                                            blood flying in all directions, bodies blown to pieces’ was a long winded
                                            but most apt description.</p>
                                        <p>Both sides might be Heavy Cavalry soldiers, but as both sides met, the
                                            Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers charged into Kalise formation like a hot
                                            knife cutting through butter, as if they were tigers pouncing upon a flock
                                            of sheep. On the battlefield, blood, flesh and broken armour sprayed in all
                                            directions, and screams of death and agony rang out throughout.</p>
                                        <p>Within a matter of moments, the clash between the Heavy Cavalry soldiers had
                                            ended. Alas, behind the Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers, there wasn’t even a
                                            single living Kalise Heavy Cavalry soldiers. In just that short period of
                                            time, the Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers were like a meat grinder machine,
                                            totally wiping out their enemies, leaving only their scattered remains
                                            behind,</p>
                                        <p>The Kalise light cavalry soldiers who were surrounding the Peerless soldiers,
                                            the infantry and archers behind the Heavy Cavalry soldiers who had been
                                            supporting them, and the distant officers including the Regiment Commander
                                            Zeng Jian…all of them were stunned silly by the sight before them.</p>
                                        <p>When had they ever seen such terrifying killing machines in their entire
                                            lives? Those were four hundred elite Heavy Cavalry soldiers! In a matter of
                                            a dozen breaths, they had been slaughtered as if they were mere cabbages
                                            being harvested in the field. This… This…...</p>
                                        <p>Just as Zeng Jian was still dazed, the Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers did
                                            not even slow their charge. Having wiped out the enemy Heavy Cavalry, they
                                            continued barreling on the path right towards the archers and infantry
                                            soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>If one could liken the Kalise Empire Heavy Cavalry soldiers’ performance just
                                            now as sheep, then the poor Kalise archers were now little white rabbits.
                                            The mass of tigers charged into the herd of rabbits, almost able to even
                                            just scare them to death! Furthermore, these tigers were armed to the teeth
                                            with those horrific looking massive weapons.</p>
                                        <p>A Battalion of archers... alas they could not even slow the Peerless Heavy
                                            Cavalry down for a split second. As the two hundred men… no, tigers…
                                            thundered past, in moments they had left behind a patch of red on the
                                            ground.</p>
                                        <p>Let alone the enemies being stunned silly… even Zhou Weiqing who was flying
                                            above ready to support his men at any time was also staring in shock.</p>
                                        <p>What kind of equipment have I given these fellows? Are they really Heavy
                                            Cavalry soldiers? I… I have created monsters! They are literally killing
                                            machines! An entire Regiment, and almost instantly a tenth of them were
                                            wiped out. For the first time, the Peerless Heavy Cavalry had truly shown
                                            their power on a real battlefield, unleashing their full might, and the
                                            sheer terror of the combat prowess had already far surpassed even Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s grand expectations.</p>
                                        <p>Atop the city walls, the watching citizens were also dazed. Was this really a
                                            fight? It looked just like a simple slaughter. Two hundred soldiers… just
                                            two hundred soldiers… and yet it looked like their enemies did not stand a
                                            chance at all. Such a powerful troop… does it really belong to our Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire?</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi was standing there moving his arms around, muttering to himself:
                                            “Impressive, just too impressive.” From the way he looked, he was itching to
                                            be on the battlefield himself, hating the fact that he was stuck up here.
                                            Although watching the fight was indeed enjoyable, he was also slightly
                                            depressed as it meant their First Company Air Force had no chance to take
                                            action at all.</p>
                                        <p>Heavy Cavalry soldiers were always the most terrifying killing machines on
                                            the battlefield, and amongst them, the Peerless Heavy Cavalry were truly
                                            gods amongst the killing machines.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing his advance forces wiped out so quickly, Zeng Jian finally came to his
                                            senses. Currently, his expression had changed drastically, fear in his
                                            heart. In such a situation, there was no time for him to ponder slowly.
                                            Instantly, he gave the orders. “Retreat! Retreat back to camp and fortify
                                            it! First, Third Infantry Battalions, set up your spears on the ground in
                                            the anti-cavalry formations. Second Battalion, return immediately to the
                                            camp to prepare the anti-cavalry traps.”</p>
                                        <p>After giving the series of orders, he led his personal guard and rushed back
                                            to camp. These… these were not humans, they were devils! How could they
                                            possibly stand against them!</p>
                                        <p>Although the Kalise Empire soldiers were in shock, their training overtook
                                            them. As orders from their superior was passed down, they subconsciously
                                            followed the instructions almost woodenly.</p>
                                        <p>The two Battalions of Infantry soldiers quickly set up their spear
                                            formations. The anti-cavalry formation, as the name suggested, was specially
                                            designed against the charge of enemy cavalry soldiers. Pushing the butt end
                                            of their spears into the ground with the points forward in an angle, and
                                            their weight to hold position, such a formation in numbers was not designed
                                            to damage their enemies, but to stop their mounts from charging past
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, although this technique which was extremely effective against all
                                            cavalry soldiers, they were currently facing the Peerless Heavy Cavalry. Not
                                            only were the soldiers heavily armoured, even their powerful Unicorn
                                            Heavenly Beasts were also armoured fully!</p>
                                        <p>Just like crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood, the two hundred
                                            Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers smashed savagely into the two Battalions. Up
                                            until now, the whole Battalion of surrounding light cavalry soldiers had not
                                            even dared to send a single soldier in attack!</p>
                                        <p>A thousand versus two hundred? It was a large numbers advantage. However, in
                                            the face of such terror, what was the use of numbers? The hearts of the
                                            light cavalry soldiers quailed as they dared not even attack.</p>
                                        <p>In the past, when the Berserker and Gold Crow Tribes were still in the Fei Li
                                            Empire, they had been forced to fight so many times against the WanShou
                                            Empire on the frontlines. They only had simple weapons, not even given
                                            proper armour, but they had caused much damage to the WanShou Empire armies.
                                            Now, with Zhou Weiqing sparing no cost to develop them and outfit them fully
                                            with such unimaginable equipment, their terrifying combat strength had
                                            already caught up and perhaps surpassed the Mammoth Regiment! How could
                                            these ordinary Kalise soldiers compare to them? Despite numbering a mere two
                                            hundred, when the gap between strengths was just too far apart, numbers no
                                            longer meant anything.</p>
                                        <p>As the saying goes, an infinite number of ants could bite even an elephant to
                                            death[1. Yes, this should be the actual saying (confused me yesterday). I
                                            believe that TJSS is using it (last chapter's version) as two sides of the
                                            same coin, depending on which is the stronger party]. However, no matter
                                            what, they had to actually be able to bite through for that to happen. The
                                            Peerless Heavy Cavalry armour was just too terrifying, the thickness and
                                            toughness. Ordinary people could not even wear it, let alone penetrate
                                            through it!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing watched from his vantage position in the air. He knew that there
                                            was no need for him to even take action any longer. He did not think of
                                            being able to kill all the enemies. Firstly, he did not need his men to do
                                            unnecessary killing, but more so, it was to conserve his strength. After
                                            all, the main force of the Peerless Regiment had not arrived, and stability
                                            was the key for him now. That was the reason why he gave the strict order
                                            for Ma Qun and Crow not to lead their troops directly into the enemy
                                            camp.</p>
                                        <p>His lips curved in a cold smirk. Today’s fight had more than accomplished all
                                            the goals that he had set. With this single charge of the Peerless Heavy
                                            Cavalry, how could the Kalise Empire Regiment still have the guts to attack
                                            the Crescent City? If not for the fact that he wanted to hide the power of
                                            his Peerless Regiment, as long as the five hundred Peerless Air Force joined
                                            in the fight, it would not have been a problem for them to wipe out the
                                            entire enemy force.</p>
                                        <p>Although he had his Peerless Regiment that seemed invincible in combat, Zhou
                                            Weiqing was still extremely careful as he began the revival of his Empire.
                                            He had his own thinking… if he revealed too much of his strength too early,
                                            then the Kalise Empire would quickly send a large number of reinforcements
                                            here, even the Bai Da Empire might be alerted to send reinforcements.
                                            However, for the rest of the Peerless Regiment to arrive, it would take at
                                            least two more months. In this window of time, with just his seven hundred
                                            men, if he had to face the onslaught of several Regiments, it would still be
                                            tough for them. After all, his main goal was still to stabilize the Crescent
                                            City and develop it as his base of operations and launching pad.</p>
                                        <p>According to Zhou Weiqing’s current understanding of the Kalise Empire’s army
                                            deployments in the Heavenly Bow Empire, for the next two months he would at
                                            least have to deal with two more waves of enemies before the rest of his
                                            Peerless Regiment would arrive. Of course, this was not counting his Master,
                                            the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya had already indicated to Zhou Weiqing that he would not join their
                                            fight on the battlefield. In truth, there was an agreement amongst all
                                            powerhouses that any Heavenly Emperor stage powerhouse and above would not
                                            be allowed to interfere in the wars of man. At their level, if they took
                                            action against ordinary humans, it could possibly lead to widescale
                                            destruction and possibly even the extinction of men! As such, it was
                                            strictly forbidden for Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouses to join in such
                                            battles, otherwise all their peers would surround the one in question to
                                            kill him.</p>
