                                            in the Lustre Spatial Realm, how difficult that is? It was definitely a once
                                            in a lifetime opportunity, perhaps never again in ten thousand years. The
                                            dragon corpse aside, just that dragon egg alone would allow us to chase
                                            those barbarians from the WanShou Empire back to the north.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, saying calmly and leisurely: “My future father
                                            in law, I just have one question for you. If Aunty Tangxian and Bing’er were
                                            to be surrounded and attacked by enemies, who were trying to gain some
                                            treasure from them, what would you think? I was just trying to help a mother
                                            only. I do not know any grand principles or morals, but I just know that
                                            everyone has a mother, and any child without a mother is just so pitiful. I
                                            admit, that my actions were indeed rash. However, I do not regret any of it.
                                            If I had to make the same choice again, I believe that I would still do the
                                            same every time.”</p>
                                        <p>“You…” Shangguan Tianyue realised that his usual control and composure was
                                            easily tested by this little rascal.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue smiled faintly and said: “What is done is done. Even if we
                                            blame you, that would not solve anything. I do admire your filial piety.
                                            Alright, enough about that. What is your request?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “If I am not wrong, one of the rewards of the Champion of
                                            the Heavenly Jewel Tournament is a God Tier Consolidating Equipment for the
                                            team leader of the winning Battle Team right?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin said: “That’s right. The Champion Team’s leader will gain a
                                            set of God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, and the other team members
                                            will each gain a Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Scroll set, as well as
                                            one chance to Skill Store a Heavenly King Stage Heavenly Beast in the Skill
                                            Storing Palace. The time for that Skill Storing will be three months, but it
                                            can be redeemed in the future. That is to say, you all can actually wait
                                            until a few years later when your cultivation level is higher and you have
                                            more confidence in Skill Storing a Heavenly King Stage Beast before
                                            returning to the Heavenly Jewel Island Skill Storing Palace. Why do you ask,
                                            are you thinking of claiming that God Tier Consolidating Equipment as
                                            well?”</p>
                                        <p>When Shangguan Longyin said that, his expression was a little strange. The
                                            reason was simple, not just himself, even the two Palace Masters could not
                                            understand why a mere three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master like Zhou Weiqing
                                            could successfully Skill Store a Heavenly King Stage Skill, let alone one
                                            ultimate skill like a Heavenly God Stage Skill!</p>
                                        <p>After the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, all the members of the ZhongTian Battle
                                            Team had given their own detailed reports to their superiors, and naturally
                                            the Palace Masters knew all about it. Among the reports, the key piece of
                                            information was definitely the Dragon Silencing Seal that Zhou Weiqing had
                                            used to instantly change the tide of battle.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that without the Dragon Silencing Seal, the huge advantage
                                            that the ZhongTian and BaoPo Battle Team had could not be so easily
                                            overturned. With Zhan LingTian at full power, he could have beaten his
                                            opponent, and turned towards the dying mother dragon. At the very least, he
                                            could have stolen the dragon egg.</p>
                                        <p>It was only because Zhou Weiqing had managed to Seal Zhan LingTian with the
                                            Dragon Silencing Seal, defeating him swiftly and heavily injuring him. After
                                            that, he had also Sealed Shangguan Fei’er, who was now currently being
                                            grounded. It was the loss of these top two members of the team that allowed
                                            the WanShou Battle Team to turn the battle in their favour, also delaying
                                            the fight long enough for the male dragon to return, and totally ruin the
                                            chance for good.</p>
                                        <p>After hearing about the Dragon Silencing Seal, Shangguan Longyin had also
                                            done a deep investigation, and the Demonic Dragon Lady had once again
                                            reached the eyes of the upper echelons of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
                                        <p>This Demonic Dragon Lady had never been Skill Stored from before, yet now
                                            this Heavenly Emperor Stage Beast had actually been Skill Stored with an
                                            unbelievably powerful Skill that actually had the Heavenly Skill Image, ever
                                            so close to the Heavenly God Stage. After so many centuries of being
                                            ignored, the Demonic Dragon Lady was once again thrown into the spotlight.
                                            Alas, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace did not have anyone that could meet the
                                            requirements in Skill Storing from it.</p>
                                        <p>Still, after Shangguan Longyin had carefully analysed Zhou Weiqing’s powers,
                                            he still could not understand how Zhou Weiqing had managed to undergo the
                                            Skill Storing of a Heavenly Beast so far above him.</p>
                                        <p>Successfully Skill Storing above one’s power and cultivation level, that was
                                            something that the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had experimented with and
                                            succeeded in as well. However, the power gap could not be too great, and it
                                            was also only possible for Nine Star rated Skills and below. Furthermore,
                                            this accomplishment was the legacy handed down after centuries in the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the fruit of labour of countless ancestors’
                                            experience and after expending so much treasure, resources and manpower.
                                            Yet, who did Zhou Weiqing have? He had entered the Skill Storing Palace
                                            alone, and had actually succeeded in such a monumental task in such a short
                                            period of time!</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin still clearly remembered the day when Zhou Weiqing had
                                            asked him about allowing him to have a look at the Heavenly King Stage
                                            Beasts and higher. It had barely been more than a day from the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Tournament finals. Yet, he had used the Dragon Silencing Seal soon
                                            after in the Tournament. In all of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace records, no
                                            other place had ever captured a Demonic Dragon Lady besides themselves. That
                                            was to say, from all evidence and inference, Zhou Weiqing had succeeded in
                                            Skill Storing from the Demonic Dragon Lady after a single try, and had
                                            gotten such a powerful, almost nature-defying skill to boot!</p>
                                        <p>Was it just luck? Then… his luck was just too unbelievable already. Yet, as
                                            he recalled, Zhou Weiqing had several highly rated Skills as well! Could it
                                            be just all luck?</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “No, it’s not that I want that God Tier
                                            Consolidating Equipment. I just hope that the great God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Masters of the Heavenly Jewel Island can help our team leader
                                            custom make that one. That is extremely important to our leader.”
                                            Previously, of the Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Scroll set that he had
                                            promised to the entire team, only Lin TianAo had not managed to get one.
                                            This time, with the chance to gain a God Tier Consolidating Equipment, it
                                            would definitely be highly critical for Lin TianAo to get one which was
                                            custom designed and created for his specific purpose. That would allow Lin
                                            TianAo to continue along the lines of his previous Assembly Shield Set,
                                            further improving his defense and overall power.</p>
                                        <p>As for Zhou Weiqing, he was currently about to gain three God Tier
                                            Consolidating Equipments. That was more than enough for his current needs,
                                            and in the next few years, he would not require any more. Even if he reached
                                            the six-Jeweled cultivation level or higher, having four God Tier
                                            Consolidated Equipment was already much more than enough to last him for a
                                            long while. Furthermore, Lin TianAo was his Follower. In Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            heart, he was definitely of utmost importance, especially for one so afraid
                                            of dying like Zhou Weiqing, improving Lin TianAo’s defensive capabilities
                                            was definitely something he took very seriously.</p>
                                        <p>From the process of how the Fei Li Battle Team had managed to gain their
                                            championship, it was without question that Zhou Weiqing had done the most.
                                            Furthermore, Lin TianAo was his Lifetime Follower. If he truly wished to
                                            take the God Tier Consolidating Equipment reward as his own, it was likely
                                            that none of the team members would object. At the same time, the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace would also have no reason to object, after all they would
                                            also gain yet another new Consolidating Equipment Scroll design, while they
                                            would not lose anything in exchange. However, Zhou Weiqing truly believed
                                            that improving Lin TianAo’s power was equally important as his own;
                                            furthermore he had no urgent need of it.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang’s expression changed minutely before he said: “Oh? You are
                                            not planning to take that God Tier Consolidating Equipment for yourself?”
                                            Even though he was the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master, he had still never
                                            heard of anyone who would refuse to take a God Tier Consolidating Equipment
                                            for himself; Zhou Weiqing was definitely the first that he had heard of.
                                            After all, every piece of Consolidating Equipment was priceless!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly before saying: “This junior will already be
                                            getting three God Tier Consolidating Equipment with the trade with the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and in the near future I will not have a need for
                                            any more. Furthermore, according to the rules of the Tournament, that reward
                                            is originally for our leader anyway. In order to get the championship, it is
                                            the hard work of our entire team, not just myself.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang smiled faintly and said: “I have a suggestion, and you can
                                            consider it. If you agree, we can go about both trades at the same
                                            time.”</p>
                                        <p>“Senior, what is your suggestion?” Zhou Weiqing said calmly.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang said: “If you are willing to tell us your method of
                                            successfully Skill Storing from Heavenly Beasts way above your cultivation
                                            and power level, our Heaven’s Expanse Palace can help you complete your
                                            entire Legendary Set. I’m sure you should have the whole set designs
                                            right?”</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Shangguan Tianyang said that, Shangguan Tianyue had a surprised
                                            look on his face. On the other hand, Shangguan Longyin remained calm, as if
                                            he had expected something like this.</p>
                                        <p>This was an entire Legendary Set! All God Tier Consolidating Equipment!
                                            Towards any Heavenly Jewel Master, this was an unbelievable enticement that
                                            was definitely irresistible.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was no different. As soon as he heard Shangguan Tianyang speak
                                            his offer, his entire body and heart was stunned, and he almost burst out in
                                            agreement at once.</p>
                                        <p>With an entire Legendary Set, along with his Devour Skill and the Immortal
                                            Deity Technique, he had confidence of breaking through to the Heavenly God
                                            Stage in the future, and reach the pinnacle of the world!</p>
                                        <p>On the other side of things, since the Heaven’s Expanse Palace has agreed to
                                            create an entire Legendary Set for him, wasn’t it tantamount to Shangguan
                                            Tianyang agreeing to his marriage with Shangguan Bing’er? As the Palace
                                            Master of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, his word would definitely hold
                                            sway.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, with the support of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace behind him, he
                                            would be able to accomplish all his goals with much less time and effort;
                                            even the Heavenly Bow Empire would benefit greatly from it.</p>
                                        <p>However, was everything as perfect as it seemed on the surface?</p>
                                        <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to exclaim his agreement to Shangguan
                                            Tianyang, Mu En’s visage suddenly appeared in his mind. Abruptly he recalled
                                            his old teacher telling him: “If one day, you meet something that is too
                                            good to be true, so good that you cannot resist it, then you must first ask
                                            yourself three times… Why? Why? Why? Because most of the times, when a pie
                                            drops down from heaven, it is usually poisoned.[1. That’s the literal
                                            translation. He is basically referencing an idiom 天上掉下来的馅饼 - which basically
                                            says ‘A pie drops down from heaven’, meaning something so good has happened
                                            to someone.]”</p>
                                        <p>These words from Mu En had been carved deeply in his head, because when Mu En
                                            had told him that, it had been with an uncharacteristic seriousness, and he
                                            had repeated himself three times with utmost solemn and earnest force.</p>
                                        <p>Why? Why would Shangguan Tianyue give something unbelievably good like that
                                            to me? Zhou Weiqing’s heart started skipping hard as he forced himself to
                                            stop and think hard.</p>
                                        <p>The next moment, the impulsive light in his eyes retreated, and a calm
                                            steadiness returned to his face. Looking at Shangguan Tianyang, a thoughtful
                                            look appeared in his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>It was the three powerhouses from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s turn to be
                                            surprised. If they looked inwardly, even if they were in Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            position, at his age and cultivation level, facing such an unbelievably
                                            tempting offer, they would definitely agree without hesitation.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that the most shocked was the one who had come brought up
                                            the suggestion, Shangguan Tianyang. When he had spoken regarding helping
                                            Zhou Weiqing complete his entire Legendary Set, he had noticed the
                                            expression on Zhou Weiqing’s face. He had personally seen the wild joy and
                                            excitement on his face, and then the sudden change to calmness just before
                                            he spoke out to agree. In some way, it could be said that such a sudden
                                            switch to a calm reaction was almost unjustified and illogical.</p>
                                        <p>Where did Zhou Weiqing’s calm and cool-headed thinking come from? That was
                                            because, when he asked himself ‘Why?’, he suddenly thought about something
                                            contradictory that he did not want to admit, but had no choice but to admit.
                                            That... was his own character.</p>
                                        <p></p>
