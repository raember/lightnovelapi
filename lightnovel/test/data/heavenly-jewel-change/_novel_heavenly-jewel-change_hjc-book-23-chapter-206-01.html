                                            through the enemy lines like a knife through hot butter. As they passed by,
                                            they just left a large patch of corpses behind.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the surviving enemy forces who still could fight at the south
                                            gate numbered less than ten thousand. With this fresh new force of a
                                            thousand breaking their lines so suddenly, they were immediately thrown into
                                            disarray.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, the sounds of drums and gongs rang out from behind the
                                            Kalise Empire lines.</p>
                                        <p>Instantly, the enemies on top the city wall and also below the city wall
                                            began to retreat, like the receding tide from a shore. The thousand black
                                            armoured cavalry did not give chase, only killing off the few enemies who
                                            passed them in their retreat, before forming up with their long lances
                                            pointed towards the retreating Kalise Empire armies.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu jumped off his mount, his feet striking the broken down wall several
                                            times for momentum, and soon he had reached the top of the wall.</p>
                                        <p>Fully dressed in military attire, Ming Yu looked especially handsome and
                                            fresh. The first person to entire his sight was Zhou Weiqing, totally
                                            drenched in blood.</p>
                                        <p>“Impressive. Very very impressive. I cannot help but be impressed… I defer to
                                            you in this truly!” As soon as Ming Yu saw that Zhou Weiqing was alright, he
                                            laughed heartily, giving him a big thumbs up.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile and said: “What so impressive! If you had
                                            come a few minutes later, we would have all perished. You have my
                                            everlasting thanks, and I will repay you in future, no need for me to speak
                                            about that.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu laughed once more and said: “It is not me who saved you, but you who
                                            saved yourselves.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started, saying: “What do you mean?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu smiled and said: “As a general, I would never bring my soldiers into
                                            a fight in which I deem there is no chance at all, a fight that is certain
                                            death. In truth, I reached the outskirts of the Crescent City three days
                                            ago. However, due to the fact that the fifty thousand Kalise soldiers were
                                            camped there, I did not approach too closely. Furthermore, since they were
                                            about to attack, I did not try to meet up with you. In my eyes, with the
                                            mere numbers you had, it would be impossible for you to hold out against the
                                            Kalise forces. This Crescent City, I had deemed lost for sure. As such, I
                                            had never even thought about coming to join the fight. All this time, I was
                                            waiting until you all failed the defense and tried to escape, then I would
                                            come to your aid in helping you escape back to the Fei Li Empire before we
                                            think of our next step.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yet, who could have guessed that you… this fellow… would actually create
                                            such a miracle. I have to admit that your Peerless Regiment is truly the
                                            finest… the strongest troop that I have ever seen in my life… to even be
                                            able to hold on for so long, to do so much… it could be said that ninety
                                            percent of the work had already been done by you all, so how could I not
                                            come join in for the last ten percent. Even without my aid, if the Kalise
                                            army really wanted to totally capture the Crescent City, the price they
                                            would have to pay would truly be unbelievably huge.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was an intelligent man, and upon hearing Ming Yu’s words, he
                                            couldn’t help but laugh in understanding: “You cunning fellow!”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu did not mind at all as he said seriously: “This is not cunning, it is
                                            the rule of survival on the battlefield. I only have a thousand men, and
                                            while I am confident in them, saving you and helping you escape is no
                                            problem at all. However, clashing against the Kalise armies in such numbers
                                            was pointless. That was the reason why I said it was you who had saved
                                            yourselves. By fighting off these Kalise armies for an entire morning,
                                            killing off more than a dozen times your numbers… If I still did not seize
                                            such an opportunity to appear at this point, I would not deserve the name of
                                            the Fei Li God General.</p>
                                        <p>“Now, at least, the Kalise Empire has been crippled. Even if they wanted to
                                            launch an attack like this again in the near future, it will be impossible.
                                            If their commander is smart enough, the best path for them now is to
                                            retreat.”</p>
                                        <p>Not caring about how they looked then, Zhou Weiqing held onto Tian’er as he
                                            flopped down on his ass onto the floor with a satisfied sigh, giving Ming Yu
                                            a bitter smile as he said: “I’m afraid my men will not have any energy left
                                            to open the city gates for you. Why don’t you just pop over down there to
                                            open the gates yourself, let your men come in.”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu laughed out, shaking his head as he said: “No, we’ll pass for now.
                                            I’m still not part of your team yet, and such rules I still do know. I’ll
                                            get my man to keep watch, send out scouts to see what they are up to, and
                                            clear up the battlefield. You all get some rest first.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, Ming Yu waved towards Zhou Weiqing and turned around,
                                            jumping right off the city walls.</p>
                                        <p>In doing so, he was avoiding any possible suspicions. After all, currently
                                            the Peerless Regiment was totally helpless, without any fighting
                                            capabilities left, while his thousand men were still rather fresh. At the
                                            same time, he was not just simply a Fei Li General, and also represented the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect. Avoiding any possible suspicions would help improve
                                            overall relations with the Peerless Regiment, and also let Zhou Weiqing feel
                                            his good faith and sincerity.</p>
                                        <p>By this time, Lin TianAo had already settled Xiao Yan and returned to Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s side. “What do we do now?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Let all our brothers rest right here. Send someone who is
                                            in relatively better condition to get the logistics personnel to send some
                                            meat soup and other food here. Also, get all the medical personnel to come
                                            here as quickly as possible and start treating everyone. Everything else, we
                                            can wait to discuss later.</p>
                                        <p>Compiling stats of injuries and death, all of that could be done later.
                                            Everyone was just too tired, and they had earned their rest. Once they had
                                            recovered, they could speak of all the other admin matters.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, though they had all just fought through an entire morning, and
                                            everyone was exhausted to the maximum, they had after all won, and their
                                            spirits were still extremely high. The logistic troops had already made some
                                            preparations, and before long large cauldrons of meat soup were being
                                            carried to the city walls. At the same time, the medical personnel were
                                            starting to treat the wounded.</p>
                                        <p>The logistics troops that the Fei Li Empire had provided was extremely
                                            complete, from smelting and smithing, medical, cooks… pretty much everything
                                            was covered. These were also experienced veterans who had battlefield
                                            experience; it was something that Zhou Weiqing had specially requested. Of
                                            course, they would not be of help in combat, but having such a complete
                                            logistical support would bring the Peerless Regiment to another level.</p>
                                        <p>Drinking the meat soup, having some simple food, along with the treatment of
                                            the medical troops… soon, the city walls rang with the sound of snoring. The
                                            soldiers were just too tired, and though there were corpses all about, they
                                            could not even summon the energy to care, just falling asleep directly on
                                            the city walls.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was no exception. With one hand holding Tian’er, they leaned on
                                            the stairs of the walls, falling deep into sleep. Just like the rest of his
                                            soldiers, he was not only exhausted physically, but mentally as well. The
                                            pressure he had been under in his heart was far beyond any others.</p>
                                        <p>Although they had definitely won this battle, Zhou Weiqing did not feel happy
                                            at all. Previously, even when he had been in the northern borders facing off
                                            against the WanShou Empire, no matter the enemies he faced, the Peerless
                                            Regiment had been victorious without any losses. As such, he still had not
                                            been used to the full cruelties of war, at least towards his own side.</p>
                                        <p>However, in the intense and horrifying battle just now, he was truly exposed
                                            to the brutal cruelty of war. He may not be clear of the exacts of the other
                                            three walls, but at least on the south side, out of the thousand fresh
                                            recruits, less than a hundred still survived. All of them had families! Let
                                            alone he still did not know how many of his Peerless Regiment brothers had
                                            perished. This weight on his heart greatly diluted the joy of victory of
                                            defeating his enemies. No matter that this battle, this victory, could be
                                            considered a miraculous win. No matter that their deaths had caused so many
                                            times more deaths of their enemies. All of that would not change the fact
                                            that these soldiers had paid the final price, and would forever leave this
                                            world.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Their sleep lasted all the way until deep in the evening, and only then did
                                            Zhou Weiqing finally rouse up. The Dragon-Tiger bloodline showed its power
                                            in a subtle form here… anyone else who had been in such a frantic battle
                                            would definitely be aching everywhere after the sleep, but Zhou Weiqing felt
                                            in tip top condition, full of energy. All his wounds had already healed
                                            fully by now, and his Heavenly Energy had actually been fully restored by
                                            the automatic regeneration of the Immortal Deity Technique. Only the Saint
                                            Energy was still in the same state as before his sleep, as the amount of
                                            energy required to be drawn in to form the Saint Energy was just too
                                            large.</p>
                                        <p>The situation on the city walls had been greatly improved since Zhou Weiqing
                                            was last conscious. At least, all the corpses had been cleared off the walls
                                            to the grounds outside. Of course, to completely clear the battlefield would
                                            take quite some more time.</p>
                                        <p>Only some of Peerless Regiment soldiers who had lighter injuries were still
                                            on the city walls, working together with the Peerless Regiment Heavy Cavalry
                                            to continue standing guard. Naturally, the Heavy Cavalry soldiers were
                                            uninjured due to their heavy armour.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er was no longer in Zhou Weiqing’s arms, and standing by his side were
                                            two Peerless Regiment soldiers guarding him. He also realised that
                                            unknowingly, someone had placed a mat below him, allowing him to sleep more
                                            comfortably.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing climbed to his feet, stretching himself fully with all his
                                            strength, feeling his muscles and tendons stretch fully in comfort. At last,
                                            he said: “What is the situation now?”</p>
                                        <p>“Commander.” The two Peerless Regiment soldiers instantly saluted towards
                                            Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing waved his hands, looking out beyond the city walls. In the
                                            distance, the Kalise army camp was still there, lit brightly. However, as he
                                            looked directly below the city walls, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but furrow
                                            his brows. The piercing scent of blood was enough to make him remember the
                                            bloody battle this morning.</p>
                                        <p>“Commander, Report. The allies from the Fei Li Empire are helping us clear
                                            the battlefield outside the walls. Most of our men are back in the city
                                            getting medical treatment for their wounds. Sir Yan Zhexi is handling most
                                            of the aftermath administration.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head. With Ming Yu and his men outside, the enemies
                                            would not dare to easily attack again, at least not anytime soon. “I will be
                                            returning to the governor’s mansion first. One of you, go notify Zhexi to
                                            come look for me there.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, Zhou Weiqing headed off the city walls and into the
                                            city.</p>
                                        <p>As he walked deep into the city, his heart sank deeper. He could hear sounds
                                            of crying all about him, clearly the families of the departed soldiers were
                                            in sorrow for the warriors who had sacrificed themselves for their
                                            sakes.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gripped his fist tightly, swearing in his heart that in future,
                                            he would do all he could to reduce any deaths on his side. For him, victory
                                            should not be at the price of his soldiers’ blood!</p>
                                        <p>As he walked into the governor’s mansion, Zhou Weiqing was given a small
                                            fright. The mansion was crowded and bustling with noise. All about, the
                                            Peerless Regiment soldiers and the remaining fresh recruits who had survived
                                            were crowded in the once-wide courtyard of the mansion.</p>
                                        <p>Soon after, he saw two busy figures. No matter looking at them from the back,
                                            he could clearly sense their shocking beauty. It was Shangguan Xue’er and
                                            Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er was examining all the wounds of the wounded, and by her
                                            side, Tian’er was truly like an angel in white, using her Heavenly Energy to
                                            form the gold light of healing, aiding the wounded soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing walked near the two beautiful ladies, he could clearly see
                                            exhaustion in their eyes and face, and on their foreheads, there was a layer
                                            of perspiration. However, without question, they looked unbelievably
                                            beautiful then.</p>
                                        <p>“Tian’er, let me help you.” Zhou Weiqing quickly stepped forward, holding
                                            onto Tian’er’s hand. If she had the support of the Saint Energy whirlpool,
                                            it would undoubtedly be of great aid for her in recovery, and even in using
                                            her healing Skills.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er turned her head to see Zhou Weiqing, and her ashen face brightened up
                                            in a faint smile. She slowly stood up from her squatting position, and
                                            before she could even stand firmly, her legs buckled before her, and she
                                            toppled into Zhou Weiqing’s arms.</p>
                                        <p>“Tian’er… Tian’er…!” Zhou Weiqing was startled, exclaiming at once.</p>
                                        <p></p>
