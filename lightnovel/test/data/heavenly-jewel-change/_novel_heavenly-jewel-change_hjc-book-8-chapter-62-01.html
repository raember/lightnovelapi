                                            feel shy. Come on, it’s time for class, everyone sit down.” As he said that,
                                            he headed towards his own seat.</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, go to the Principal’s office, she is looking for you.” Ming Hua’s
                                            voice rang out.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily, turning to look at Ming Hua. All the
                                            students also turned their gazes towards her, and instantly the atmosphere
                                            in the class turned nervous.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua furrowed her brow and said: “Everyone, do not worry. I can guarantee
                                            that nothing will happen to your monitor. Although this matter is a little
                                            troublesome, but our Principal is after all the Princess of our Empire, and
                                            not someone the nobles can easily trifle with.”</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, we’ll go with you.” Kou Rui said excitedly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing turned back around to face his classmates, and with a peaceful
                                            gaze he said calmly: “Very good, we now truly feel like a real team, a
                                            family. As for going with me, it isn’t necessary. After all, Teacher Ming
                                            Hua has already said that nothing would happen right? I’ll be back soon, you
                                            guys study hard, it is class time after all. Stop standing around, all of
                                            you sit down.” As he said the last line, he glared at them, and the rest of
                                            the commoner students finally settled down.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua sighed to herself inwardly as she sat behind the podium, thinking.
                                            Perhaps, this class might turn into the best class that the Academy has ever
                                            taught. This Zhou Weiqing is really something, this is true unity. For a
                                            class of students to truly unite, there needs to be a core, a heart, and
                                            this core was apparently not herself, the teacher, but instead Zhou Weiqing.
                                            Of course, in order to become this core, he had also done a lot, so much
                                            that even though Ming Hua felt a little envious, the emotion she felt the
                                            most was admiration. As she settled her various personal feelings about Zhou
                                            Weiqing and calmed down, she could analyse the entire situation, and see why
                                            her father and brother looked so highly upon him.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing left the classroom alone, he calmed himself down and walked
                                            slowly towards the Principal’s office. At the same time, he pondered what
                                            could be the possible outcomes.</p>
                                        <p>It was unlikely that Ming HUa would lie to him about the situation, after all
                                            she had stated it in front of the entire class.</p>
                                        <p>That was to say… the beautiful lady Principal would protect him. However, at
                                            the same time, as Ming Hua and Ye Paopao had mentioned, it would not be easy
                                            for her to withstand all the pressure from so many nobles. It looks like he
                                            would have to give something up, perhaps get a slightly heavier punishment.
                                            This was likely the reason Principal Cai Cai was looking for him.</p>
                                        <p>He could deal with a bigger punishment without any problems, after all that
                                            did not affect his overall plan. Zhou Weiqing quickly smiled. Since he had
                                            gotten Yun Li and Lin TianAo as Followers yesterday, and seen the unity of
                                            his classmates today, his mood was currently extremely good. As such, he was
                                            not troubled by the upcoming punishment.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing reached the fourth level where the Principal’s office was,
                                            he just happened to see a group of noble students dressed in their splendid
                                            uniforms walking down the stairs, looking glum and dissatisfied. Without
                                            question, these were the ones who had tried to lodge a complaint against
                                            him. Looking at their expressions, Zhou Weiqing was certain of his guess,
                                            that the Principal would not submit to them.</p>
                                        <p>Knocking twice on the door, he tidied his uniform unhurriedly, his usual
                                            honest smile appearing on his face. Whether or not others would believe it
                                            was one matter, but he would always maintain his act.</p>
                                        <p>“Come in.” Cai Cai’s solemn voice rang out from within.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing pushed open the door and entered.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai was not alone in her office, and Dean Xiao Shi was also there,
                                            seemingly deep in discussion with her.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing entered, Cai Cai’s expression sank, and she turned to
                                            Xiao Shi and said: “Dean Xiao, let’s continue this later. Indeed, our
                                            Academy’s customs needs to be stricter. If there are any more fights, no
                                            matter what status both sides are, we will expel both sides.”</p>
                                        <p>Xiao Shi gave a respectful bow of agreement before turning to leave. As he
                                            passed by Zhou Weiqing, he gave a helpless smile. This incident had also put
                                            a lot of pressure on him. After all, he was the Dean of Students, and the
                                            discipline of the school was also part of his responsibilities. Many of the
                                            nobles could not do anything to the Princess, and instead turned to put
                                            pressure on him. If not for Cai Cai’s support, he might have been in deep
                                            trouble.</p>
                                        <p>As Xiao Shi left, Zhou Weiqing advanced forward a few steps with a big smile
                                            on his face. With a courtly bow, he said: “Good morning, Principal.”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai gave a cold humph and said: “You troublemaker, do you know how much
                                            problems you have caused to the academy with your actions?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said honestly: “It is all my fault, I am so sorry to have caused
                                            the Principal and the academy so much trouble. If there needs to be any
                                            further punishment, please punish me alone. It was I who couldn’t stand it
                                            and instigated my classmates to take action. I just beg that I have the
                                            chance to continue staying here to learn, and not expel me. I still have
                                            mmuch to study and learn.”</p>
                                        <p>The Zhou Weiqing now was looking totally sincere and honest, with his
                                            expression holding just a hint of depression from being wronged. That look
                                            wa smiles apart from that overjoyed and smug look he had last night after
                                            getting two great Followers.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Cai Cai had called in Zhou Weiqing to give him a big scolding
                                            before getting on to the main matter. However, with him admitting his
                                            mistakes, apologising and willing to take up the responsibility and any
                                            extra punishments, she couldn’t help but feel her heart soften.</p>
                                        <p>Everything else aside, just the fact that Zhou Weiqing was willing to take
                                            the punishment on behalf of his classmates was extremely admirable, and that
                                            willingness to shoulder responsibility and admitting fault was also
                                            something she appreciated.</p>
                                        <p>As such, Principal Cai Cai’s expression eased up a little, and she said
                                            passively: “I hear that you are the class monitor of commoner class
                                            one?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, his eyes reddening as he said: “Yes, my classmates have
                                            honoured me. Principal, please do not worry, I will not make things
                                            difficult for you. When I go back to class, I will resign my post, I just
                                            hope that you do not expel me.” Although he said that, our dear Little Fatty
                                            was grinning inside his heart. He was highly experienced at taking beatings
                                            from his father since a young age, and without even using his eyes, he could
                                            just tell from Cai Cai’s tone that she had already softened and was on his
                                            side. This was likely to result in anything bad for him today.</p>
                                        <p>“Nonsense, what making things difficult for me.” Cai Cai exclaimed angrily.
                                            “Yesterday, I have already made my decision on the matter, and I will not
                                            change it. Do they think that they can pressure me with just the few of
                                            them? This is the Fei Li Royal Family Military Academy, not their nobles’
                                            backyard!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing wisely kept his mouth shut at this point in time. Things seemed
                                            to be going pretty well, and no matter what he said now, it might actually
                                            have an adverse effect.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai stood up from behind her desk, slowly walking out. Although Zhou
                                            Weiqing had his head bowed down, he was still able to see her beautiful and
                                            graceful figure. <i>Is she really thirty-five years old? Even a twenty five
                                                year old might not be able to compete! </i>He couldn’t help but think to
                                            himself. This rascal had a zero immune system towards beauty, and couldn’t
                                            help but swallow a large gulp of saliva. Both of them were princesses, but
                                            comparing Difuya and Cai Cai’s aura and they way they carried themselves, it
                                            was just like night and day.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai walked towards Zhou Weiqing and said: “I have already shouldered this
                                            matter, and the nobles will not dare to come to the academy grounds to cause
                                            trouble. However, I will not be able to stop them from doing anything
                                            underhand. After all, I can’t possibly send a few men to guard you around
                                            the clock. This time, you are way too obvious of a target. Just like you
                                            said, you were the one who instigated it. Do not think that you can try to
                                            trick me with a few words, I have already understood the entire matter.
                                            However, since you still seem sincere in apologising and admitting your
                                            mistakes, and the matter is already settled, I will not give you any further
                                            punishment. However, in order to ensure your safety, you will have to leave
                                            the academy for a short while.”</p>
                                        <p>“Ahh? No!” Zhou Weiqing was stunned in his heart, not expecting that Cai Cai
                                            would actually ask him to leave. At this point, they were barely two yards
                                            apart, and this rascal leapt forward towards Cai Cai, hugging her feet,
                                            sobbing as he said: “Principal, don’t expel me!! I know I’m wrong… please
                                            let me stay…”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai had never expected that Zhou Weiqing would suddenly pounce on her out
                                            of the sudden, and actually was too surprised to react. In her thirty over
                                            years of living, this was the first time she had been so close to a man, and
                                            in that instant, she was stunned into silence.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing had not expected to hug Cai Cai. After all, it had
                                            been an involuntary reaction, and also he knew she was extremely powerful.
                                            After hugging her, Zhou Weiqing’s weak willpower regarding females instantly
                                            changed again, after all Cai Cai was only wearing a thin teacher’s robe, and
                                            her slim legs were in his arms, even the feel of them through the robes
                                            caused this rascal to bleed from the nose… and onto the robes.</p>
                                        <p>Wow, that was so awesome! The sweet scent from Cai Cai caused Zhou Weiqing to
                                            put his face onto her leg, as he started crying in such a heartbroken
                                            manner. After all, do not forget who his teacher is… a man with the nickname
                                            of God Eye Scoundrel!</p>
                                        <p>Mu En had once told him that in front of those weaker than him, he had to
                                            take control, but in front of those clearly stronger than him, he had to be
                                            shameless. This was especially so with women. Naturally, our dear Student
                                            Little Fatty was following his teacher’s instructions, and was enjoying it
                                            as he did so.</p>
                                        <p>“Let go of me!” Cai Cai cried out. After a moment of shock where she didn’t
                                            do anything, her beautiful face flushed totally red, forgetting all about
                                            her power, and only just pushing Zhou Weiqing’s head away from her legs.</p>
