                                            Heavenly Emperor Stage. </p>
                                        <p>After Zhou Weiqing had killed off Tian Yu, he did not descend to the ground
                                            immediately. Instead, he hovered in the sky and calmly equipped himself with
                                            his Legendary Set.</p>
                                        <p>Piece by piece, dark golden light continued to light up all around his body.
                                            Due to the fact that the light halo was flashing too fast, it was hard to
                                            distinguish the number of pieces of Legendary Set he was equipped with.
                                            However, the final color that emerged was dark gold.</p>
                                        <p>The Legendary Set itself was originally hard to distinguish with the naked
                                            eye. Once the complete set was equipped, one would be able to tell how many
                                            pieces there were based on the aura it gave off. However, if the Legendary
                                            Set was not complete and there was only a shade of dark golden light, it
                                            would still be difficult to distinguish.</p>
                                        <p>That was exactly the case for Zhou Weiqing. After he had equipped himself
                                            with his Legendary Set, his massive Legendary Set had given off an
                                            overbearing aura. However, it was not complete! </p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s current condition, the anger within Fen Tian had
                                            simmered down a little. This fellow was too strange - nothing he did made
                                            any sense at all. As the Sect Leader of the Peerless Sect, he did not even
                                            have a complete Legendary Set. Even so, he still managed to kill off one of
                                            his Heavenly Emperors. What exactly was he doing? </p>
                                        <p>Holding onto the Dual Legendary Hammers in his hands, Zhou Weiqing shouted in
                                            the sky, “Next! Come on up.”</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the powerhouses on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain
                                            gradually woke up to their senses. Shangguan Tianyang said without
                                            hesitation, “We concede defeat for this fight.” The Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace’s Heavenly King got switched out and was replaced by another Heavenly
                                            King.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian glared at Shangguan Tianyang and said, “We concede defeat too.
                                            We’ll send in another person.” As he spoke, he replaced the representative
                                            with another Heavenly King. The Lion King Gu SiTe whispered in Xue AoTian’s
                                            ear and the latter shook his head.</p>
                                        <p>Next, it was the Passion Valley’s turn. Huang Xingyun pondered for a moment
                                            before saying, “We concede defeat too.” The person he had sent in earlier on
                                            was a Heavenly King. Even a Heavenly Emperor was killed off that easily,
                                            what was the point of sending his Heavenly King into the battlefield? </p>
                                        <p>Everything happened too fast - the Blood Red Hell had not even sent in the
                                            next person into the battle line upon Tian Yu’s death.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, everybody’s gaze fell on Fen Tian, waiting to see how he was
                                            going to react to the situation before him. The Grand Tournament had already
                                            entered the fifth cycle, but the Peerless Sect had only sent out three
                                            people thus far.</p>
                                        <p>In the eyes of everyone, it seemed as though the Peerless Sect only had those
                                            three strong powerhouses. However, Zhou Weiqing’s display of power had put
                                            Fen Tian in a difficult position. Naturally, he could tell that Zhou Weiqing
                                            was using the Saint Energy and the Destructive Attribute had no effect on
                                            him at all. However, both Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun had a major
                                            disadvantage - they could not comprehend Zhou Weiqing at all.</p>
                                        <p>It was inevitable. After all, Zhou Weiqing was way too young – all this time,
                                            he was not much of a threat in their eyes. When the Blood Red Hell had
                                            suffered losses because of him, catching Fen Tian’s attention, the Grand
                                            Tournament of Saint Lands had already begun. Even if Fen Tian was wary of
                                            Zhou Weiqing, deep down in his heart, he still felt that a mere Zhou Weiqing
                                            would not be able to be compared to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace or the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain. </p>
                                        <p>However, at this moment, Fen Tian had suddenly realized that he might have
                                            committed a huge mistake. With the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya, the
                                            Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue, as well as the mysterious Zhou Weiqing who he
                                            could not comprehend, the Peerless Sect was no less of a threat compared to
                                            the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>Hence, at this juncture, dealing with the matter at hand had become the
                                            biggest problem. If Shen Mo had not gone against Long Shiya earlier, sending
                                            Shen Mo in would be the most ideal move. If that was the case, in the event
                                            that Shen Mo managed to kill off Zhou Weiqing, the Peerless Sect would be
                                            done for.</p>
                                        <p>A light flashed across Fen Tian’s eyes and he looked at Huang Xingyun, who
                                            was not far from him. This time, he did not try to hide his intentions. The
                                            light flashed within his eyes, seemingly hinting something to Huang
                                            Xingyun.</p>
                                        <p>Huang Xingyun furrowed his brows and gently shook his head.</p>
                                        <p>Fen Tian narrowed his eyes and said in a deep voice, “Shen Bu, it’s your
                                            turn.” Ultimately, he chose to continue to repress himself. However, even he
                                            himself had no idea how long his patience would last. </p>
                                        <p>A woman with an enchanting figure, who looked as though she was in her
                                            thirties, walked out from behind. She looked extremely beautiful, every
                                            movement she made exuded all kinds of charms. Her eyes gave off seductive
                                            vibes. When she walked out elegantly, it seemed as though her slender waist
                                            would snap at any moment. She was practically like an enchanting Snake
                                            Woman.</p>
                                        <p> “Yes, Hell Lord.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu did not rapidly soar to the sky. Instead, she walked up step by step
                                            towards the sky, as though there was a staircase built in it. With every
                                            step she took, her ‘S’-shaped figure could clearly be seen. She had a
                                            bashful look on her face; the charm she exuded could cause the hearts of any
                                            weaker cultivators to beat rapidly beyond their control.</p>
                                        <p>The impact made on Zhou Weiqing was the most direct. That was because Shen
                                            Bu’s gaze was fixated on him from the very beginning. Zhou Weiqing never
                                            knew that a woman’s gaze could express that many emotions. </p>
                                        <p>There was grief, and excitement in the next moment, followed by bashfulness
                                            and anger with a tinge of flirtiness. Every single emotion seemed to have
                                            tugged on his heartstrings. Zhou Weiqing could not help but open his mouth
                                            by the sight of her, but at least he did not drool.</p>
                                        <p>However, nobody would mock him at this very moment. That was because there
                                            were quite a number of people on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain who
                                            actually drooled. Even a woman would blush when she looked at Shen Bu’s body
                                            and every movement.</p>
                                        <p>She was Shen Mo’s cousin. Within the Blood Red Hell, her status was lower
                                            than that of Shen Mo’s because of her cultivation base. However, she was the
                                            only person that Fen Tian did not dare to offend. </p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu had always been naturally charming since she was a child. Even as her
                                            cultivation base increased, she was not particularly outstanding in other
                                            areas. However, her charm merged with her personal Heavenly Energy to form a
                                            special mutated attribute, which the Blood Red Hell termed as the Charm
                                            Attribute. In the past, the people who she could seduce were limited to male
                                            cultivators with a lower cultivation base than her. However, after she had
                                            merged her Charm Attribute with the Destructive Attribute, the Charm
                                            Attribute was enhanced, becoming a unique ability of hers. She was only a
                                            Mid Level Heavenly Emperor, but when she had fully activated her Charm
                                            Attribute, even Fen Tian could not completely resist it. Furthermore, it
                                            affected both males and females.</p>
                                        <p>This time, Shen Bu was Fen Tian’s trump card in this Grand Tournament.
                                            Originally, he planned to use her against Shangguan Tianyang or Xue AoTian.
                                            However, with Zhou Weiqing’s strong powers, he had no choice but to send her
                                            out earlier in the tournament than expected.</p>
                                        <p>Even though Fen Tian looked extremely mad, his heart was very cool and
                                            collected. He had heard stories about Zhou Weiqing’s love affair. As a
                                            hot-blooded young man, it was only normal for him to fall for women. Hence,
                                            after much consideration, he had decided to send Shen Bu out to deal with
                                            Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>The main reason why he sent out his trump card, Shen Bu, that easily was
                                            because Fen Tian had finally taken Zhou Weiqing seriously. From this moment,
                                            Fen Tian saw him as a true leader of a Saint Land, and wanted to deal with
                                            him as one.</p>
                                        <p>Even though Fen Tian had exchanged blows with Zhou Weiqing earlier, he did
                                            not use his full force at that time. Although he had experienced Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s Saint Energy and Attribute, as well as his Heavenly Emperor
                                            powers, in Fen Tian’s heart, Zhou Weiqing was far from Xue AoTian or
                                            Shangguan Tianyang’s level. However, when Zhou Weiqing’s unprotected body
                                            took a direct hit from his Heavenly Emperor, he was clear that the young man
                                            before his eyes posed a threat to his plan - and it was a rather huge one.
                                            If he could take the opportunity to get rid of him during the Grand
                                            Tournament, it would clearly be of a great advantage to his future plans.
                                            Furthermore, Fen Tian wanted to see how strong Zhou Weiqing’s true power
                                            was. Of course, killing off Zhou Weiqing before he got to display his full
                                            power would be the most ideal scenario. </p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu looked at Zhou Weiqing with a gentle gaze, as she continued to ascend
                                            to the sky, step by step. Both parties did not use any abilities against
                                            each other, or mobilize the atmospheric energy. The bright and beautiful
                                            sunlight shone down on the both of them; under the golden light, they looked
                                            like a pair of long-lost lovers that were reunited, as they drew closer to
                                            one another.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu’s gaze did not intensify as she got closer to Zhou Weiqing. Instead,
                                            it became more gentle. If the initial gaze was seductive in nature, then her
                                            current gaze had gradually caused one to feel pity and sad, akin to a wife
                                            waiting for the return of her husband.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was in a daze; his gaze was clearly frozen, fixating on Shen Bu
                                            who was approaching. Even the Dual Legendary Hammers had fell out of his
                                            hands. </p>
                                        <p>All the members of the Peerless Sect began to panic - even Long Shiya and Wu
                                            Yunyue had stopped cultivating and focused their attention on what was
                                            happening in the sky.</p>
                                        <p>The Blood Red Hell did not let their guard down either, All the Blood Red
                                            Hell powerhouses stared intensely at the Peerless Sect. The moment anyone
                                            from the Peerless Sect had the intention to save Zhou Weiqing, they would
                                            attack them immediately.</p>
                                        <p>The three sisters, Shangguan Xue’er, Fei’er, and Bing’er, looked extremely
                                            worried. Little Witch, on the other hand, looked angry. Only Tian’er looked
                                            calm. </p>
                                        <p> “Aren’t you worried?” asked Ling Dang, the person who was fully decked in a
                                            cloak. She was the person that Zhou Weiqing sent out to fight earlier.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er snorted and said, “What’s there to worry? Even if that bastard is
                                            completely enamored by her gentleness, that woman will not be able to break
                                            his defense. As for control over his mind? Hmph!”</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, the other women had overheard Tian’er’s words. They seemed to have
                                            experienced a sudden epiphany and the worry in their eyes started to
                                            fade. </p>
