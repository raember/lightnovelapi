                                            King Stage and above, and be given permission by the upper echelons of the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace before being allowed into try Skill Storing on them.
                                            No outsiders were actually even allowed to enter that portion of the Skill
                                            Storing Palace.</p>
                                        <p>In the entire mainland, Heavenly God Stage Heavenly Beasts were extremely
                                            rare, though perhaps not as rare as Heavenly God Stage Jewel Masters, it
                                            could still be described as rare as the feathers of a phoenix and the horns
                                            of a qilin[1. I think I’ve mentioned this before - literal translation of
                                            凤毛麟角, its meaning should be obvious, just alluding to something being
                                            extremely rare]. To even find a Heavenly God Stage Heavenly Beasts was
                                            something so rare, and to find one Sealed or willing to be Skill Stored, it
                                            could be said that even in the entire mainland, one could count on the
                                            fingers of a hand.</p>
                                        <p>What was so great about this Zhou Weiqing? What sort of insane luck did he
                                            have to be able to find a Heavenly God Stage Heavenly Beast, and more so, to
                                            successfully Skill Store!</p>
                                        <p>After all, even if it were a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse attempting to
                                            Skill Store from a Heavenly God Stage Heavenly Beast, the success rate was
                                            barely one in ten thousand. That was to say, if this Heavenly King Stage
                                            powerhouse were unlucky, it might take more than thirty years of continuous
                                            trying before succeeding. Even a lucky one might still take ten years or
                                            so.</p>
                                        <p>In fact, for a Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse attempting to Skill Store
                                            from a Heavenly God Stage Heavenly Beast, the current known record in the
                                            entire mainland was five years and nine days!</p>
                                        <p>Yet, on this Heavenly Jewel Tournament grounds, one such Skill had just
                                            appeared. How could everyone not be shocked to the core? No matter what Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s cultivation level was, when he released this Skill that could
                                            summon the Heavenly Skill Image, he undoubtedly became the focal point of
                                            the entire battlefield.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Skill Image behind Zhou Weiqing was not very clear, just a vague
                                            silhouette, a dim purple-red in colour. Its upper body seemed to be that of
                                            a human female, long hair cascading down, but its lower body clearly had a
                                            large thick tail wrapped around.</p>
                                        <p>Towards such an image, everyone was left puzzled. None of them had any idea
                                            what kind of Heavenly Beast looked like this.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, it was normal for them to be clueless about this. This Heavenly
                                            Beast that Zhou Weiqing had Skill Stored from was indeed from the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Island Skill Storing Palace. However, it was a Heavenly Beast that no
                                            other person had Skill Stored from before, although the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace had actually caught this beast over four hundred years ago! Let alone
                                            the ZhongTian Battle Team members being unable to recognize it, even if the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master Shangguan Tianyang was here, he might not be
                                            able to recognize it as well!</p>
                                        <p>In fact, the Heavenly Beast that Zhou Weiqing had Skill Stored from was
                                            actually not at the Heavenly God Stage. If it truly were, no matter how high
                                            ranked his and Fat Cat’s Heavenly Beast auras were, with their current
                                            cultivation level it was not possible for him to succeed.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Beast he had Skill Stored from was actually a Heavenly Emperor
                                            Stage Heavenly Beast, but it was one of the most powerful amongst the ranks
                                            of Heavenly Emperor Stage beasts, with its power coming infinitely close to
                                            the Heavenly God Stage, though it had not broken through the final layer. In
                                            addition to that, due to the fact that it was an extremely powerful Dual
                                            Attribute Skill, when he had unleashed the Skill, it had actually generated
                                            the Heavenly Skill Image.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Beast which Zhou Weiqing had Skill Stored from was called the
                                            Demonic Dragon Lady, rumoured to be descendants of the offspring between the
                                            mating of dragon and human, a half-blood half dragon half human, with the
                                            cunning and intelligence of humans, and power close to that of a dragon.
                                            Even if a Heavenly God Stage Heavenly Beast faced off with it, it would
                                            still be able to hold its own.</p>
                                        <p>Four hundred odd years ago, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had spent more than
                                            30 years planning, arranging and finally capturing this Demonic Dragon Lady.
                                            Even so, they had expended many resources in doing so, with even the
                                            then-Palace Master perishing in the fight.</p>
                                        <p>When they had caught the Demonic Dragon Lady, they had been overjoyed,
                                            thinking they could recoup their losses by Skill Storing powerful Skills
                                            from it. Alas, who knew that the Demonic Dragon Lady was not simply a Dual
                                            Attribute Heavenly Beast like they had judged previously, with the Darkness
                                            and Evil (Demonic) Attribute separate, but in fact, her both Attributes were
                                            intertwined closely, especially so for all her Skills.</p>
                                        <p>As such, this resulted in an increased difficulty in Skill Storing in
                                            addition to the original difficulty of being a Heavenly Emperor Stage Beast.
                                            Not only that, the Heavenly Jewel Master had to have both the Demonic and
                                            Darkness Attributes in order to succeed, adding yet another layer of
                                            difficulty. Of course, those two Attributes were commonly found only in the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect, and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace did not have anyone
                                            with both those Attributes at the same time. Naturally, they did not want to
                                            give any advantage to the Heavenly Demon Sect, and would not be so foolish
                                            as to let the Heavenly Demon Sect benefit from this Heavenly Beast. As a
                                            result, in the past few hundred years, no one had successfully Skill Stored
                                            from it.</p>
                                        <p>The first time that Zhou Weiqing had entered the Heavenly Jewel Island Skill
                                            Storing Palace and checked regarding his various Attributes, he had found
                                            out about the existence of this Demonic Dragon Lady, he had taken careful
                                            note for the future times that he visited the Skill Storing Palace. Although
                                            the Demonic Dragon Lady had already been Sealed for over four hundred years,
                                            and was extremely beaten down, it still gave him huge problems. If not for
                                            Fat Cat’s help, as she suppressed the Demonic Dragon Lady with her Spirit
                                            and Divine Attributes, giving enough time for Zhou Weiqing to Devour the
                                            last bits of her energy before Skill Storing, he would not have stood a
                                            chance.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, it had not been an easy task for them both. That was the reason why
                                            he had returned back to the inn so late after Skill Storing, and why the
                                            rest of the team saw him in such a shabby shape when he returned.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing pointed the Legendary Hammer in his right hand towards Zhan
                                            LingTian, who had just shown his impressive prowess, and a purple red light
                                            erupted from it towards him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian’s heart sank. Facing Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly God Stage Skill,
                                            he knew that he had no chance to dodge it. Instantly, he reacted in the best
                                            way possible, channeling his Heavenly Energy with all his might; at the same
                                            time, he flew backward as far as possible, trying to put as much distance
                                            between him and Zhou Weiqing as he could.</p>
                                        <p>A cold smirk appeared on Zhou Weiqing’s lips. Although this Skill of his was
                                            not exactly at the Heavenly God Stage, it was still a top powered Dual
                                            Attribute Fusion Skill of the Heavenly Emperor Stage. In terms of its
                                            effects, it was definitely comparable to most ordinary Heavenly God Stage
                                            Skills.</p>
                                        <p>The Demonic Dragon Lady had many powerful Skills, but in order to use many of
                                            them they had extremely harsh restrictions, amongst which was the amount of
                                            Heavenly Energy required was at the Heavenly King Stage or higher. As such,
                                            even if Zhou Weiqing had Skill Stored some of its more powerful Skills, he
                                            would be unable to use them at will, just like the Dark Demon God
                                            Lightning.</p>
                                        <p>As such, after careful thinking and consideration, for the sake of the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament, Zhou Weiqing had decided to Store an Absolute
                                            type Support-type Control Skill.</p>
                                        <p>When his Legendary Hammer pointed towards Zhan LingTian, the surrounding
                                            people on the battlefield could clearly see a strange purple-red symbol
                                            appear above Zhan LingTian’s head, swirling in a mixed purple and red light.
                                            It was soon followed by another purple-red light that was shot forth from
                                            the Hammer. Let alone dodging it, Zhan LingTian was not even able to see it
                                            clearly before his retreating body was struck by it, causing him to stiffen
                                            as his entire body was enveloped in the purple-red light.</p>
                                        <p>A strange sight occurred next. The four God Tier Consolidated Equipment that
                                            Zhan LingTian had already summoned out disappeared like snow vanishing in
                                            the summer heat. At the same time, his entire body turned that same
                                            purple-red colour.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian was struck by a sudden fear as he realised he was unable to do
                                            anything. His Consolidated Equipment had disappeared, as if he was totally
                                            cut off from them. When he tried to use any of his Stored Skills, he found
                                            that he was also cut off from his Elemental Jewels. As a result, he was
                                            unable to access any of his Elemental Attribute powers, only able to access
                                            the pure Heavenly Energy within his body.</p>
                                        <p>“Thirty Seconds. He will not be able to use any Consolidated Equipment or
                                            Stored Skills. Leave it to me for now. Go handle the others.” Zhou Weiqing
                                            shouted out loud while still in midair, right before he landed onto the
                                            ground. Clearly, he had been shouting out to the WanShou Battle Team
                                            leader.</p>
                                        <p>The Skill that he Stored from the Demonic Dragon Lady was called the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal, and its most powerful effect was that it was Absolute. As
                                            soon as it was unleashed, the target would not be able to dodge or block it;
                                            once Zhou Weiqing had locked onto his target, he or she would definitely
                                            have to withstand the effect of the Dragon Silencing Seal.</p>
                                        <p>Dragon Silencing Seal did not have any offensive power at all, but it could
                                            Absolutely Silence and Restrict its target. Once afflicted by the Seal, the
                                            target would not be able to use any Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills.
                                            At the three-Jeweled cultivation level, Zhou Weiqing was able to Seal his
                                            target for thirty seconds! Another benefit of the Dragon Silencing Seal was
                                            that it did not require him to use any of his own Heavenly Energy. However,
                                            at the same time, its usage was also highly restricted. Currently, he was
                                            only able to use it three times a day.</p>
                                        <p>When his cultivation was higher, the Skill would naturally improve and evolve
                                            as well. According to the records, at the Heavenly King Stage, the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal would turn from a single target Seal to an area of effect
                                            Seal, affecting everyone in a set area.</p>
                                        <p>Thirty seconds. That was an extremely long time, especially in the heat of
                                            battle. Once a Heavenly Jewel Master lost the ability to summon his
                                            Consolidated Equipment or use his Stored Skills, that would be tantamount to
                                            losing almost sixty to eighty percent of his total power. This Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal might not have offensive power, but its use in combat was
                                            definitely top notch.</p>
                                        <p>Like most Absolute Skills, the Dragon Silencing Seal would be much more
                                            useful and powerful when used against opponents of higher cultivation level;
                                            the higher the target, the better the effect. After all, the higher their
                                            cultivation usually meant their Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skill was
                                            much more powerful, and thus their reliance on them would also increase.</p>
                                        <p>In such a way, Zhou Weiqing’s very first Dragon Silencing Seal was given to
                                            Zhan LingTian. <i>Hmph! Aren’t you so powerful? Let’s see how you fair
                                                without all your Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills!</i></p>
                                        <p>As soon as the Dragon Silencing Seal came into effect, Zhou Weiqing did not
                                            hesitate to charge towards Zhan LingTian. Thirty seconds. It might be a long
                                            time, but at the same time he could not dally in this period where Zhan
                                            LingTIan had been turned into a fangless tiger.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Zhan LingTIan was still able to access his own Heavenly Energy,
                                            and the huge gap between him and Zhou Weiqing still existed. However, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had the huge advantage granted to him by his sheer physical
                                            strength, while Zhan LingTian’s Physical Jewel was that of Stamina. His
                                            defenses might be slightly tougher, but he was definitely the type of
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master that tended towards his Elemental Jewels. In this, he
                                            was the exact opposite of Shangguan Fei’er.</p>
                                        <p>If Shangguan Fei’er had been the target of the Dragon Silencing Seal, she
                                            would not have been so affectd. After all, with her own Heavenly Energy and
                                            her formidable close combat skills, she was still able to unleash a large
                                            percentage of power.</p>
                                        <p>However, Zhan LingTian was different. His greatest strength was the
                                            terrifying power of the Light and Darkness Attributes mixed together. Once
                                            his Elemental Jewel Stored Skills were Sealed, he would naturally be unable
                                            to access the two Elements, and his threat level with just the pure Heavenly
                                            Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing was in the Demonic Change State, with the Dual
                                            Legendary Hammers in his hands and having Sealed Zhan LingTian, he had
                                            absolute confidence in taking on Zhan LingTian directly, especially since he
                                            still had the surprise factor in hand. WIthout a doubt, the cunning young
                                            fighter would not let such a chance go so easily and waste his thirty
                                            seconds.</p>
                                        <p>Upon landing on the ground, Zhou Weiqing stomped down hard, and as he swiftly
                                            activated his Tornado Strike Skill, charging forth towards Zhan
                                            LingTian.</p>
                                        <p>When the Wanshou Battle Team leader heard Zhou Weiqing’s shout, he started
                                            momentarily. However, he reacted swiftly, turning and charging towards
                                            another one of the ZhongTian Battle Team members.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of overall strength, he was actually above Zhan LingTian. After all,
                                            his Heavenly Beast was the huge ape fighting with Shangguan Fei’er. Although
                                            both fights resulted in a disadvantageous situation, it did not change the
                                            fact that he had taken on the top two powerhouses of his opposing team… All
                                            by himself! Currently, given a bit of time to recover, he was able to launch
                                            a fresh attack from an extremely advantageous position.</p>
                                        <p></p>
