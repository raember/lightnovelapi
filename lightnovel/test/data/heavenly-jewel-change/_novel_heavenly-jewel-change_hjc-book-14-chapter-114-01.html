                                            was faced with impending danger, it might spark a subconscious reaction to
                                            save himself. Although the black clad man was struck by both the Fetters of
                                            Wind and Absolute Delay, as a Upper Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master,
                                            when his life was in critical danger, he somehow managed to explode forth
                                            with all his hidden potential, his hands held up in a defensive posture,
                                            turning totally red. It was clearly a type of melee Skill of the Fire
                                            Attribute. Although his movements were slowed drastically, he was still able
                                            to barely block Zhou Weiqing’s blow.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not change tactics; if he did so, he had absolute confidence
                                            in killing off this enemy delayed by Absolute Delay. However, at the same
                                            time, if he did so, it would open him up to the other three six-Jeweled
                                            enemies.</p>
                                        <p>To take attacks from three enemies, or to just clash head on with a single
                                            enemy, with the advantage of two Legendary Set God Tier Consolidated
                                            Equipment. The choice was clear.</p>
                                        <p>As the saying goes, one has to seize the opportunity, as once it is gone, it
                                            may not come back again. Having created such an opportunity with the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal, it was definitely one that did not come by easily, and he
                                            would not give it up like that. Even though when he reached the Four-Jeweled
                                            stage, he could now use the Dragon Silencing Seal four times per day, with
                                            his character he would not easily use them all out. After all, he always
                                            preferred to keep an ace up his sleeve for desperate times, especially to
                                            save his life. Furthermore, he did not know if there were any other hidden
                                            enemies besides these few.</p>
                                        <p>*BANG* Four palms slammed hard into each other, and Zhou Weiqing immediately
                                            sensed something was wrong. Although with his Demonic Change State and the
                                            boost from two Legendary Set pieces he should have been able to more than
                                            rival his enemy’s greater Heavenly Energy, he was meeting with unexpected
                                            resistance.</p>
                                        <p>The black clad man’s palms seemed like a red hot molten soldering iron, and
                                            even though he had the Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms to protect his hands,
                                            Zhou Weiqing could still sense the searing heat. That was not the only
                                            thing; the more critical issue was that there was a strange suction force
                                            emitting from his enemy’s palms, causing Zhou Weiqing to slow down. At that
                                            point, he could see the ferocious grin on his enemy’s face.</p>
                                        <p>With so many enemies surrounding him, Zhou Weiqing knew he could not let
                                            himself be cornered, and if he was slowed, it would undoubtedly be a
                                            harbinger of doom for himself. WIthout question, this black clad enemy
                                            wanted to be the one who brought it to him.</p>
                                        <p>However, that smirk on the black clad enemy’s face only lasted for an
                                            instant. After all, Zhou Weiqing’s pure physical strength was just too
                                            terrifying. As their four palms pushed against each other, although the
                                            black clad enemy had been able to forcibly stop Zhou Weiqing’s Yin Yang
                                            Giant Spirit Palms for a moment due to the sudden burst of power from his
                                            Skills, but as their palms continued to press against each other, he
                                            realised that with the Absolute Delay in effect, he couldn’t even break free
                                            if he wanted to.</p>
                                        <p>In the next instant, Zhou Weiqing reacted in the best possible way. Ignoring
                                            the intense heat from his palms, he changed swiftly from a palm strike to a
                                            death grip, gripping down hard on his enemy’s hands.</p>
                                        <p>Ultimately, Zhou Weiqing was wearing the Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms, and the
                                            sharp claw tips of the fingers and their sheer piercing power came into
                                            effect right then. With Zhou Weiqing’s strength, he did not even need to use
                                            another Skill, and with that sudden burst of power, an ear-piercing sound of
                                            bone shattering accompanied by the cries of agony from the black clad men
                                            rang out simultaneously. Instantly, Zhou Weiqing activated the Devour Skill,
                                            as he continued gripping onto the shatter hands of his enemy.</p>
                                        <p>However, the black clad man had indeed bought his companions enough time, and
                                            the three others’ Skills were flying out at Zhou Weiqing. This time, they
                                            went all out, bursting forth with all their maximum effort and power,
                                            sparing no costs as they launched their strongest attacks. Even the
                                            seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, though unable to use any Skills or
                                            Consolidated Equipment, charged forward, his hands glowing with white
                                            Heavenly Energy as he struck towards Zhou Weiqing’s head.</p>
                                        <p>After totally crushing his enemy’s hands, Zhou Weiqing started Devouring his
                                            Heavenly Energy, and at the same time, he did an abrupt Suplex Move [1. <a
                                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex">Wrestling Move</a> ]</p>
                                        <p>Just like that, the large black clad enemy in his hands was thrown backwards
                                            behind him, and at the same time, the third and last Consolidating Equipment
                                            God Protective Aura sprang forth around Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>*Bang**Bang**Bang*</p>
                                        <p>The sounds of explosions came in an almost continuous stream at Zhou Weiqing,
                                            the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura successfully blocking the
                                            attacks from the three black clad enemies. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing
                                            infused a Lightning Explosive Palm into the body of the black clad enemy in
                                            his hands, throwing him out as he exploded in an attempt to block the three
                                            behind him.</p>
                                        <p>After fighting for so long, Zhou Weiqing was already an arrow at the end of
                                            its flight [2. Literal translation for the Chinese idiom, 强弩之末. Pretty much
                                            as it says, at the last of his energy / at the end of the ropes]. At this
                                            point, it was down to see which side could burst forth with that last bit of
                                            killing power.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, Zhou Weiqing’s plan had finally failed. The Consolidating Equipment God
                                            Protective Aura had successfully blocked the ranged attacks from the three
                                            enemies, but was unable to block the strike from the incoming seven-Jeweled
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>Although he had been struck with the Dragon Silencing Seal, his powerful
                                            Heavenly Energy was still there, full as ever. Seeing the dark gold aura
                                            spring out around Zhou Weiqing, this low level Zong Stage Master actually
                                            managed to forcibly pull himself back from his attack, striking the air to
                                            let himself stall in midair for a moment, managing to wait out the
                                            Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura before striking downwards once
                                            more.</p>
                                        <p>In such a way, it would undoubtedly weaken his own attack, but at the same
                                            time, he had successfully avoided the Consolidating Equipment God Protective
                                            Aura and struck down at a point where Zhou Weiqing was no longer able to
                                            dodge it.</p>
                                        <p>Still in the middle of the suplex throw position, Zhou Weiqing was struck
                                            hard by his enemy’s palm right smack on the chest.</p>
                                        <p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic Change State and Immortal Deity Shield
                                            showed their effects, as a thick white vortex of light appeared below the
                                            low level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master’s palms. At the same time, Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s chest muscles rippled, doing his best to weaken the blow as much
                                            as possible.</p>
                                        <p>Despite all of that, Zhou Weiqing was still smashed down hard onto the
                                            ground, savagely crashing into the ground, cracking it. Even the dual
                                            Legendary Hammers that he had just summoned was actually disrupted by the
                                            sudden flux of energy and disappeared almost as fast as they appeared.</p>
                                        <p>Fresh blood erupted from his mouth as Zhou Weiqing fell onto the ground.
                                            However, he was extremely stubborn and indomitable, especially when it came
                                            to his fear of death. At any point of time, his survival instincts were
                                            incomparable to any others, even in such an unbelievably unfavourable
                                            situation. Instantly, Zhou Weiqing used a Blink Skill at the last second,
                                            sending himself ten feet away, barely dodging the next strike from the low
                                            level Zong Stage enemy.</p>
                                        <p>If not for the Dragon Silencing Seal, that low level Zong Stage powerhouse
                                            would have severely injured or even killed Zhou Weiqing in that single
                                            blow.</p>
                                        <p>However, one could not underestimate the importance of Zhou Weiqing killing
                                            off another opponent at the expense of taking an injury. In truth, he was
                                            already at the end of his sustaining capabilities, and dared not Devour any
                                            more Heavenly Energy. His own Heavenly Energy was already at such a low that
                                            he could barely control any more of the Devoured Heavenly Energy. According
                                            to his original plan, with the Dragon Silencing Seal and a last burst of
                                            effort, he should be able to kill off three of the remaining five enemies.
                                            Alas, he had met with unexpected resistance from the first target, and the
                                            swift actions of the other enemies had also caused him to lose that chance.
                                            Still, being able to kill off one was already the best result after all the
                                            surprises. After all, do not forget that our dear Zhou Little Fatty was only
                                            at the four Jeweled stage!</p>
                                        <p>Blinking ten yards away, Zhou Weiqing could no longer contain himself, and
                                            spat out another mouthful of fresh blood. Although the low level Zong Stage
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master could not use any Skills or Consolidated Equipment,
                                            his Heavenly Energy level was still at the Heavenly Xu Stage, far beyond
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s level. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing’s current Legendary
                                            Consolidated Equipment Set was mostly boosting his strength and offensive
                                            capabilities, and not his defense. Currently, Zhou Weiqing felt as if his
                                            internal organs were all inflamed, his insides churning as the pain struck
                                            him. The energy whirlpools of the Death Acupuncture Points at the chest area
                                            were also slowing drastically, as the injury was truly no mere trifle.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, I’m here to help!” A tall figure suddenly charged forth from behind,
                                            standing in front of Zhou Weiqing. It was Ma Qun.</p>
                                        <p>Even Zhou Weiqing had not imagined that Ma Qun, this cunning wily fellow,
                                            would actually be so loyal. Currently, Ma Qun had charged forward, his eyes
                                            bloodshot, breathing heavily, but with a resolute look on his face. Standing
                                            in front of Zhou Weiqing, the yellow glow of the Earth Attribute shining
                                            forth around his body, his arms extended in a protective stance in front of
                                            Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, when the fight had first started, Ma Qun had been sent flying back
                                            into the house before he could react. Startled, he had climbed up and
                                            thought to jump out to help.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, when he saw that the enemies were all at the six-Jeweled stage, he was
                                            stunned silly. Even in the entire Fei Li Military Academy, it would not be
                                            easy to see so many powerhouses together at once, yet he managed to see six
                                            of them here, and being enemies to boot. At least, Ma Qun knew his own
                                            limits, and facing enemies of such capabilities, he knew that he would not
                                            only be useless, but a detriment to Zhou Weiqing if he tried to help.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Ma Qun had been left confused, overwhelmed and at a loss, trying to
                                            think how Zhou Weiqing could possibly offend so many powerhouses, the fight
                                            had already started.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to the appearance of the six Upper Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters, Ma Qun was even more surprised when he saw Zhou Weiqing’s four sets
                                            of hEavenly Jewels. He was even more so when Zhou Weiqing actually started
                                            fighting against the six powerful opponents!</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun had witnessed with his own eyes how Zhou Weiqing, only at the
                                            four-Jeweled Stage, had actually managed to kill six-Jeweled powerhouses one
                                            after the other, in such a bloody, savage fashion. Although Zhou Weiqing did
                                            look rather scary in his Demonic Change State, to someone like Ma Qun who
                                            highly regarded strength as the most important, that was all he was
                                            concerned about. He was after all still a young man, and his feelings were
                                            easily infected, and seeing Zhou Weiqing tear apart enemy after enemy,
                                            though Ma Qun knew he could not help, his blood was already boiling with
                                            excitement.</p>
                                        <p>He did not know why Zhou Weiqing was so powerful, but he was definitely
                                            rejoicing that he had made such a choice months ago, and more so now to
                                            Follow Zhou Weiqing. Originally, he had not been fully willing to do so, but
                                            seeing the rest of the class do so, he had not wanted to be left behind and
                                            jumped out to make such a decision. After all, he knew that he would never
                                            be able to graduate from Fei Li Military Academy with his results.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, by that point, Ma Qun did not feel any sense of regret. Having
                                            seen Zhou Weiqing killing his enemies like some demon god, he knew that he
                                            had made the right choice. His Boss Zhou was already so powerful at the
                                            four-Jeweled stage, what would he be like at the six, nine stage or even
                                            higher? Would he be invincible? With such a boss, if they survived today,
                                            what would he have to be afraid of in the future? He would definitely have a
                                            good life ahead of him! [3. TJSS actually used this term (吃香的喝辣的) which when
