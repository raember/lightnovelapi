                                            not focusing on the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, instead focusing
                                            on the Demonic Change State?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said: “Do you think that your current manipulation of your Stored
                                            Skills is not bad?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head and grinned: “It is alright, right?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said passively: “Little brat, remember my words clearly: Pride
                                            will cause one to stop improving, to even deteriorate. Remember this, as
                                            long as you have the will, there is no limit to improving any ability. Watch
                                            this.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, Long Shiya flicked his wrist, and a Wind Blade appeared on
                                            his palm, consolidated and solid almost like a real blade. At the same time,
                                            his own Heavenly Skill Image appeared.</p>
                                        <p>“What do you think about this Wind Blade of mine? Is it already at the
                                            maximum that the Wind Blade can reach?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded without hesitation and said: “Of course, this is a Wind
                                            Blade that can be favourably compared to a Heavenly God Tier Skill.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya smiled faintly and said: “Look again.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing was shocked to see green light shimmer around
                                            Long Shiya’s surface skin, staining his entire body with the green, mixed
                                            with several flickers of a metallic glow. The Heavenly Skill Image above his
                                            head also shimmered slightly and seemed to grow clearer, more solid.</p>
                                        <p>Along with the changes in his body, the Wind Blade in Long Shiya’s palm also
                                            started to change. It was still as well formed and solid as ever, but it
                                            rapidly grew larger. In a moment, it had almost doubled in size.</p>
                                        <p>“What about now? How would this Wind Blade compare to the one before?” Long
                                            Shiya looked at Zhou Weiqing and asked.</p>
                                        <p>By this moment, how could Zhou Weiqing not understand what his teacher was
                                            trying to convey. Respectfully, he said: “I understand the lesson now. As
                                            long as we keep on training, practicing and improving, with greater Heavenly
                                            Energy backing it up and improvement in technique, there is no limit to any
                                            Skill. The so-called limit is just the limit of our own cognition and
                                            perception, or perhaps preconceived notions.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya nodded in satisfaction. Teaching an intelligent disciple was
                                            definitely an enjoyable task.</p>
                                        <p>“Very good. Alright then, now tell me about your experience and understanding
                                            of this Demonic Change State Skill.” The Wind Blade in Long Shiya’s palm
                                            disappeared at once, as if that little object that held the terrifying power
                                            to level an entire hill never existed in the first place.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head and said: “The Demonic Change State arises from
                                            the union of a bloodline power and the Demonic Attribute, the body is
                                            stimulated by the Demonic Attribute Heavenly Energy, evoking and triggering
                                            some unknown power in my bloodline… from there it instantly boosts the
                                            user’s body. Strength, defense, offense… almost every single attribute is
                                            raised substantially, even my senses become far more acute. Also, I am able
                                            to use the bloodline aura to frighten some weaker Heavenly Beasts. Once in
                                            the Demonic Change State, I am able to always unleashed a hundred twenty
                                            percent of my power in combat; at the same time all my Demonic Attribute and
                                            Darkness Attribute Skills seem to have some additive power to them. For
                                            example, my Dark Demon God Lightning… with my current cultivation level, I
                                            can only actually use it to its full effect when I am in the Demonic Change
                                            State.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya did not even bat an eyelid as he continued: “Alright, then of all
                                            of the powers you mentioned the Demonic Change State provides, which is the
                                            most important one?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started in surprise, and for a moment, he was at a loss for
                                            words. From his perspective, every single one of the powers the Demonic
                                            Change State granted him was extremely important. When he used the Demonic
                                            Change State in actual combat, even without considering his powerful Skills
                                            and his own powerful physique, it already enabled him to fight equally
                                            against an opponent with one more Heavenly Jewel. That was to say, the
                                            Demonic Change State could be said to be ‘giving him’ an extra Heavenly
                                            Jewel worth of power, just without the extra Skill. In complement to his six
                                            Attributes, his vast array of powerful Skills and Legendary Set Consolidated
                                            Equipment… that was the reason why he was able to defeat so many enemies of
                                            much higher level than himself. Of course, a lot of it was also due to luck
                                            and being underestimated, it was without question that his unique, strange
                                            Skills and the Demonic Change State had all been a major factor in those
                                            victories.</p>
                                        <p>However, if he really had to rate all the various powers the Demonic Change
                                            State granted him, and to state which was the most useful, he was truly
                                            unable to do so. Even the Heavenly Demon Sect’s Demonic Manual did not
                                            mention anything about such a thing.</p>
                                        <p>“You’re unable to pinpoint it right?” Long Shiya continued solemnly after a
                                            pause. “Remember this carefully. The most important boost that the Demonic
                                            Change State grants you is not the obvious power, defense, or even what it
                                            grants to your Demonic or Darkness Skills. It is the perception and sensory
                                            boost.”</p>
                                        <p>“Perception?” Zhou Weiqing was rather surprised. He had truly not expected
                                            the answer to be along this line of thinking.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya nodded and said seriously: “That’s right. Perception, or your
                                            senses. Think back in detail, whenever you enter the Demonic Change State,
                                            when you are facing your enemies, aren’t you able to better focus and easily
                                            sense the changes in your enemy’s attack patterns and movements? Also, your
                                            control over your body, your Energy and your Skills, it is much clearer.
                                            Lastly, you are much better able to find any weak points in your enemies,
                                            especially in between their Skill usage and compatibility.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing thought for a moment, before realising that it was all true.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya gave a cold laugh and said: “The true reason why the Four Great
                                            Saint Lands discriminate against the Heavenly Demon Sect is because of that
                                            ice cold perception. All those that I mention will allow a person to always
                                            be able to use his capabilities at a hundred and twenty percent, to reduce
                                            the chances of mistakes and yet capitalize on your enemies’ ones. This is
                                            not something that just strength, defense, offense, or Skills can bring to
                                            you. And this is what we term the ‘Ice Cold Perception’, and the true
                                            strength it brings…</p>
                                        <p>In this state of ‘Ice Cold Perception’, not only will your judgement of both
                                            sides’ strength will improve, it will help you in choosing and using what
                                            Skills to use, judgement of the battleground and clarity in your
                                            surroundings and everything happening at once. Even if you lapse in
                                            consciousness, your personal strength can still be subconsciously brought
                                            into play at full power. However, in your previous usage of the Demonic
                                            Change State, it can be said that you have slightly neglected this most
                                            important tool it has provided, and as such you have not fully made use of
                                            the Demonic Change State.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s heart was struck by a thought, and he said: “The Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect had once let me read their Demonic Manual to try and get me on
                                            their side… however, there was no mention of this at all in that Demonic
                                            Manual.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya laughed heartily and said: “The true power of the ‘Ice Cold
                                            Perception’, and how to improve it… that is the absolute core secret of the
                                            entire Heavenly Demon Sect. Unless you actually join them and become part of
                                            their core members, how could they possibly reveal it to you? Although the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect is the weakest of the Five Great Saint Lands, none of
                                            the other four would underestimate them. In the Heavenly Demon Sect, there
                                            may not be many members who actually have the ability to use the Demonic
                                            Change State, at most over twenty people. Out of those, there are probably
                                            only six or seven who have reached the Heavenly King Stage or higher. Even
                                            so, with just these few powerhouses who are able to enter the Demonic Change
                                            State, even if they face off against ordinary Heavenly Emperors, they can
                                            still hold their own. According to conventional thinking, a Great Saint
                                            Lands requires at least one Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse to hold the
                                            fort, yet the Heavenly Demonly Sect does not have a single one, and even
                                            their Sect Master is at the Max Level of the Heavenly King Stage. Yet, even
                                            if I were to face off against him, if he went all out without caring about
                                            his own life, although he will not be able to defeat me easily, if I wanted
                                            to kill him, he would have a forty percent chance of dragging me into hell
                                            along with him… Do you know how terrifying that is… how massive the gap
                                            between the max level Heavenly King Stage and max level Heavenly Emperor
                                            Stage is? I can tell you accurately that the difference between the two is
                                            just like the gap between you currently with a Heavenly King Stage
                                            powerhouse. From the Heavenly King Stage onwards, each small stage is a
                                            major power increase, let alone the large stage. In such a circumstance, for
                                            the Demonic Change State to enable him to somewhat close that gap, you can
                                            imagine how terrifying that is… and why the other Four Great Saint Lands are
                                            so afraid of the Heavenly Demon Sect.”</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing felt unbelievably lucky in his heart, not
                                            because he had the Demonic Change State, but because he had a teacher like
                                            Long Shiya. It just felt so good to have a teacher to teach him and guide
                                            him on to the right path, allowing him to refrain from making wrong turns
                                            and mistakes.</p>
                                        <p>“Master, then how should I practice this ‘Ice Cold Perception’? How do I
                                            bring the Demonic Change State to the maximum?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya fell silent for a moment as he lapsed into thought, before he
                                            said: “I once duelled with the Heavenly Demon Sect Sect Master and defeated
                                            him. However, it gave me the chance to witness the maximum power of the
                                            Demonic Change State… which is not having Demonic Change State…”</p>
                                        <p>“Wha--?!” Zhou Weiqing’s eyes widened, his jaw agape. That answer had truly
                                            stunned him.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said: “What I mean by not having the Demonic Change State, could
                                            also be called a permanent-state Demonic Change State. That is to say, when
                                            one has trained the Demonic Change State to the maximum, on the surface you
                                            do not have any change, but your body is already permanently in the Demonic
                                            Change State.”</p>
                                        <p>“This is the true maximum level of the Demonic Change State, but as for how
                                            to reach it, I’m afraid that only the core members of the Heavenly Demon
                                            Sect would know this. Perhaps, this is something you have to fumble your way
                                            around to figure out… or maybe when you reach the Heavenly King Stage, you
                                            will be able to sense some clues and traces on how this will come to be.
                                            However, the link between the maximum level of the Demonic Change State and
                                            the ‘Ice Cold Perception’ is only in the sustaining of it forever, but the
                                            true profound secret in actually improving ‘Ice Cold Perception’ is in the
                                            training your mental and spiritual force.”</p>
                                        <p>“What determines the strength of our perception and senses is actually our
                                            mental and spiritual force. The ‘Ice Cold Perception’ of the Demonic Change
                                            State is actually just using your body to consolidate your spirit and
                                            increase your sensory perceptions. As such, to improve the ‘Ice Cold
                                            Perception’, the main focus is to increase your spiritual energy. Out of the
                                            four Saint Attributes, Time, Spirit, Divine and Demonic, I do not even have
                                            one, but you actually have two of them! The best way to train your spiritual
                                            energy will be to to stay in the center of a spiritual force field,
                                            constantly being battered by outside spiritual energy forces, from weak to
                                            strong, constantly using that external stimulation to let your own spiritual
                                            energy grow.”</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but ask: “Master, in that case, the
                                            Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers of the Heavenly Snow Mountain two Saint
                                            Attributes, the Divine and Spirit Attributes. Doesn’t that mean their
                                            sensory perception is also extremely strong? They would not be weaker than
                                            the Demonic Change State in that case right?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said with a hint of surprise in his voice. “Not bad, you little
                                            rascal, you even know about the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger, you know quite
                                            a lot for your level! Actually, I was just about to say that if you want to
                                            improve your spiritual energy, you will actually need to ascend the Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain. I have fought a few times with that old fellow on the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain, and have grown to have a slight friendship from
                                            that. As for your question, that is a good question indeed. Your guess is
                                            right, the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers of the Heavenly Snow Mountain also
                                            have extremely strong perceptions. However, their perception is improved
                                            through a spiritual force field, and they can use that extended senses to
                                            activate their attacks. On the other hand, the ‘Ice Cold Perception’ of the
                                            Demonic Change State is more towards a supportive role that is like a
                                            passive effect than an active one. The key phrase are the words ‘Ice Cold’,
                                            to be in the calmest coldest state to utilise one’s senses. It can be said
                                            that both have their own benefits and advantages compared to the other.
                                            After all, the Divine Attribute is also a Saint Attribute.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had a bitter look on his face: “I doubt I can actually ascend
                                            the Heavenly Snow Mountain to train right…” As he spoke those words, he
                                            suddenly thought of Tian’er, about that night, and his heart fluttered.
                                            However, he knew very clearly that with his current power, he did not have
                                            the qualification to ascend the Heavenly Snow Mountain to look for
                                            Tian’er.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya laughed heartily and said: “Well, there is another simpler method
                                            to train the ‘Ice Cold Perception’, but at the same time it is much less
                                            efficient and a lot slower. That is, you constantly maintain the Demonic
                                            Change State, to constantly feel and experience the ‘Ice Cold Perception’
                                            while in that state and all the various intricacies, learning all you can
                                            about it. At the same time, when you are cultivating and training normally,
                                            you can do so while in the Demonic Change State, for as long as you
                                            can.”</p>
