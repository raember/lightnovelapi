                                            Palace together with Tian’er. This time, they stayed there for three whole
                                            days.</p>
                                        <p>In this three days, not only did Zhou Weiqing complete all the Skill Storing
                                            of his fourth Elemental Jewel, he also managed to complete Consolidating the
                                            next two pieces of his Legendary Set. By the time he walked out from the
                                            Skill Storing Palace, holding onto Tian’er’s hands as he did so, he felt as
                                            if he were totally reborn.</p>
                                        <p>When they had first arrived at the ZhongTian City to join the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament, he was only at a mere three-Jeweled cultivation level, and both
                                            his Stored Skills and Consolidated Equipment were not completed then. Yet,
                                            now, he was already a four-Jeweled Low Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master, with all Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills to boot. More so,
                                            he had gained many powerful, highly rated Skills, and now had a total of
                                            three Legendary Set pieces! His entire power levels had definitely
                                            skyrocketed, a mighty force to be reckoned with.</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, let us rest for a day, we’ll leave tomorrow ok?” Tian’er said
                                            softly.</p>
                                        <p>It was already in the evening at that time, and descending from the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Island was not too safe. As such, Zhou Weiqing agreed, and the two
                                            returned to their inn. Zhou Weiqing went to look for one of the employees on
                                            the Heavenly Jewel Island to pass a message to Shangguan Longyin that the
                                            entire Fei Li Battle Team would be leaving the next day.</p>
                                        <p>The night grew later, and Zhou Weiqing stood by his window, staring out into
                                            the distance. The Heavenly Jewel Island was high up above the sea level, and
                                            here, he could see many stars that were usually covered on the ground. The
                                            stars in the skies seemed to be like many precious jewels embedded in the
                                            heavens, twinkling and shining, a beautiful and grand sight.</p>
                                        <p>Looking in the direction of the Heavenly Bow Empire, Zhou Weiqing’s fists
                                            clenched hard. <i>Father, Mother, Godfather, I will definitely take revenge
                                                for all of you. Even if it is just me alone, no matter how long it
                                                takes, I will definitely destroy the Kalise and Bai Da Empires. </i></p>
                                        <p>At that moment, his mind involuntarily thought of the Lustre Spatial Realm,
                                            and that unbelievably powerful sight of the majestic Heavenly God Stage
                                            Dragon and the Skill it had unleashed, overwhelming the entire skies.
                                            Although a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse could not stand and fight against
                                            an entire army of a million strong, but even if once was a failure, a second
                                            time was a failure, that did not mean he would fail forever. Zhou Weiqing
                                            had thought things through and come up with a basic plan. If possible, he
                                            would try his best to raise an army of his own to restore his homeland. If
                                            that was not possible, then he would cultivate hard, training hard to become
                                            a powerhouse, a killing machine, stabbing right into the heart of the
                                            enemy.</p>
                                        <p>A soft, warm body pressed against him from behind, and a pair of arms
                                            encircled his waist gently. Zhou Weiqing turned around slowly to see
                                            Tian’er, especially beautiful under the shimmering moonlight, dressed in a
                                            snow white long dress, accentuating her long flowing white hair and the pair
                                            of mesmerising purple eyes.</p>
                                        <p><i>She is my woman now! </i>Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but feel a sense of
                                            pride well up within his heart. Gently, he wrapped Tian’er in his arms. At
                                            that point, he suddenly felt a wild dream overcome him. If one day, when
                                            everything ended and the dust settled, he would bring Bing’er and Tian’er to
                                            this beautiful Heavenly Jewel Island to stay forever, and not have a care in
                                            the world. That would be wonderful indeed.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er lowered her head, covering her sorrowful eyes, burying her head into
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s chest as she said softly: “Weiqing, take me.”</p>
                                        <p>How could Zhou Weiqing resist such a request? Stretching out his arms, he
                                            lifted Tian’er up in his embrace, feeling her soft body trembling.
                                            Instantly, the negative emotions in his heart disappeared once more, as the
                                            two young lovers intertwined in both body and soul.</p>
                                        <p>This was another sleepless night; not just for Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, but
                                            also the other poor fellows in the inn. When Tian’er’s loud, wild cries rang
                                            out loud, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but think to the future, that they
                                            would have to find a more desolate and widely spaced place to live in.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er seemed even wilder this night; having tasted the forbidden fruit of
                                            desire, she was actually more on the initiative this time.</p>
                                        <p>At such a young and hot blooded age, naturally our dear Zhou Little Fatty was
                                            not to be outdone. After a long, drawn out ‘fight’, the white tiger finally
                                            lost out to the black tiger, begging for mercy as it was ‘defeated’...</p>
                                        <p>“En?” When Zhou Weiqing was awoken from his dreams by the sun shining in from
                                            the window, he subconsciously embraced the figure beside him, only to meet
                                            with nothingness.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er was not beside him, and Zhou Weiqing sat up on the bed, stretching
                                            himself as he sensed the faint scent Tian’er had left in the air, and a
                                            great sense of satisfaction filled his heart.</p>
                                        <p>The truth had indeed proven itself, and Tian’er was indeed right. As the two
                                            had coupled the second time, their Heavenly Energy had only improved
                                            slightly, definitely nothing in comparison to the immense increase of the
                                            first time. Even so, as Zhou Weiqing woke up in the morning, he felt as if
                                            his body was lighter, feeling great overall.</p>
                                        <p>In his most painful moment, she was there for him. At the time when he was
                                            almost about to break down, she had used her soft body to gently comfort his
                                            aching heart. Perhaps, their road ahead would be extremely tough and fraught
                                            with difficulties, but no matter what, Zhou Weiqing would not back down. She
                                            was his, forever.</p>
                                        <p>Looking around, Zhou Weiqing suddenly spotted a letter lying on the bed where
                                            Tian’er had been last night. Picking it up, he opened it casually. However,
                                            when he saw the first line of words of the letter, he suddenly froze.</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, by the time you read this, I will have left. Although it was
                                            unbelievably difficult to make this decision, I have no choice but to do so
                                            and leave you. I’m sorry Weiqing, that I have to leave you in the time of
                                            your greatest need, but I have no choice at all…”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er’s words were somewhat jumbled, clearly when she was writing this
                                            letter, she had been at such a loss. “In the Heavenly Jewel Tournament
                                            finals, the members of the WanShou Battle Team had already spotted me. When
                                            you were learning from the three Masters, they came looking for me, asking
                                            me to return together with them. However, I rejected them. Alas, now that
                                            they have already spotted my whereabouts, they also realised that something
                                            is between us. They already left a while back, but I stayed here to wait for
                                            your return. I’m afraid that by now, Father will have sent men, and that
                                            fiance of mine, here to look for me.”</p>
                                        <p>“You are already in too much… way too much trouble. I cannot allow you to get
                                            into more trouble because of me, to be hurt because of me. As such, I have
                                            no choice but to leave. Luckily, before I do so, I am able to give myself to
                                            you. Do not worry, since I am already yours, that will never ever change. No
                                            matter how much they try to force me, I will only be Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            woman.”</p>
                                        <p>“Father only has one child, and as his only daughter, he will not force me
                                            too much. As long as I threaten him with my death, he will not be able to do
                                            anything to me. However, I’m afraid that in the near future, I will not be
                                            able to look for you.”</p>
                                        <p>“Do not come looking for me, please, I beg you. I know that with your
                                            character, it is easy for you to throw caution to the wind, to put your all
                                            in doing something despite any dangers. If you really do so, then you will
                                            be wasting the painstaking trouble that I have gone through now. You have
                                            many important things to do, and many people depending on you now. At least,
                                            before you have sufficient power, you cannot come looking for me. For
                                            myself, I will try my best to persuade my father.”</p>
                                        <p>“I may have left, but I have no regrets, only a longing for you. Weiqing, you
                                            have never told me that you loved me yet, but… I love you.”</p>
                                        <p>The final words were her signing off: Your Tian’er, your Fat Cat.</p>
                                        <p>Grasping the letter in his hands tightly, Zhou Weiqing rushed out of the room
                                            into the clear fresh air outside. The chill of the morning gave his heart a
                                            slight chill of bleakness.</p>
                                        <p>Bing’er would not return with him, and Tian’er had also left. Although he
                                            knew that Tian’er had done so for his own sake, he couldn’t help but feel a
                                            sharp pain in his heart.</p>
                                        <p><i>Tian’er, I love you! </i>Zhou Weiqing howled out loud in his heart. Alas,
                                            Tian’er was no longer able to hear it. Who knew when he would be able to
                                            actually speak those words to her directly.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Descending the Heavenly Jewel Island, the team purchased fourteen fine
                                            horses. With seven of them each riding one, they galloped at top speed
                                            towards the Fei Li Empire.</p>
                                        <p>In the end, Zhou Weiqing did not go looking for Tian’er. His feelings were
                                            undoubtedly important, but at this moment, the demise of his homeland filled
                                            his heart. Furthermore, at this moment, he truly did not have the power and
                                            qualification to go looking for Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why there were seven of them was because they were joined by
                                            someone else from the Heavenly Jewel Island. It was a twenty three year old
                                            young lady, with a rather easy to remember name, Dou Dou.</p>
                                        <p>Dou Dou did not belong to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, but she was the direct
                                            disciple of Xing Tianyi, the head of the three Masters!</p>
                                        <p>Previously, after the thirty seven days Zhou Weiqing had spent learning from
                                            the three Masters, Xing Tianyi had asked Zhou Weiqing to bring this young
                                            disciple of his along to travel and experience the world.</p>
                                        <p>Dou Dou had been adopted since she was a baby, and brought up by Xing Tianyi.
                                            All her life, she had lived in the Heavenly Jewel Island, and it could be
                                            said that she was extremely sheltered, with no contact at all with the
                                            outside world. Xing Tianyi hoped that she could go out into the real world
                                            and experience everything for herself. With Zhou Weiqing’s protection, he
                                            was also more at ease. This was also a decision Xing Tianyi had made after
                                            learning from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace about how Zhou Weiqing had risked
                                            falling out with the Heaven’s Expanse Palace when he had protected that
                                            mother dragon and egg in the Lustre Spatial Realm.</p>
                                        <p>In comparison with his power, Xing Tianyi’s choice was more because of his
                                            appreciation of Zhou Weiqing’s character.</p>
                                        <p>As for Dou Dou, Zhou Weiqing had actually only met her for the first time
                                            after leaving the Heavenly Jewel Island. The events of the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire had caused him to be confused and disconcerted, and he had totally
                                            forgotten about his previous promise. However, when Xing Tianyi had been
                                            notified by the Heaven’s Expanse Palace about Zhou Weiqing’s leaving, he
                                            quickly sent Dou Dou out personally to join him.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, Zhou Weiqing had told Xing Tianyi that this time, when he
                                            returned, he would definitely be facing many dangers, and did not recommend
                                            bringing Dou Dou along. After all, he could not even guarantee his own
                                            safety, let alone hers. However, Xing Tianyi insisted in him bringing her
                                            along, indicating that she could protect herself, and that it was time that
                                            she got out to experience the world.</p>
                                        <p>In the end, Zhou Weiqing did not reject it. Not only did he owe the three
                                            Masters a lot, this young lady Dou Dou was also a powerful and skilled
                                            Grandmaster Consolidating Equipment Master in her own right. According to
                                            Xing Tianyi, she was already not far from reaching the Zong Stage!</p>
                                        <p>After all, Xing Tianyi could be said to be the current top God Tier
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master in the entire world, and could his personal
                                            disciple be bad at all?</p>
                                        <p>This Dou Dou was not especially beautiful, especially when compared with top
                                            beauties like the three Shangguan sisters, Tian’er and Little Witch; her
                                            looks were above average at best, and a far cry from them. However, she
                                            brought a totally different feeling to the rest of the Fei Li Battle Team
                                            members.</p>
                                        <p>Dou Dou had one favourite hobby, and that was eating. She did not have much
                                            contact with the outside world at all, and in terms of her character, she
                                            was a little blur in that sense. She did not know about the perils of human
                                            character, and as long as someone gave her something good to eat, she would
                                            follow along. Of course, for Zhou Weiqing to successfully bring her along,
                                            besides her Master’s instructions, he had indeed used that tactic.</p>
