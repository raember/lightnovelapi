                                            Tempering period to be at five days.</p>
                                        <p>Ordinarily speaking, if a person did not eat and only drank water, his body
                                            could only last for seven days before perishing. Of course, for Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters, that could extend up to perhaps fifteen days or more.
                                            However, in such a case, it would be extremely detrimental to the body, down
                                            to the foundation. Although Zhou Weiqing only chose a five day period, do
                                            not forget that he was going to continue doing this many times over.</p>
                                        <p>Five days of cultivation, two days of rest and recuperation. That was the
                                            training schedule that Zhou Weiqing had set for himself. Each time he would
                                            focus on a single Skill, and after five days of tempering it, he would spend
                                            the day to let his body heal and re-nourish it, at the same time reflecting
                                            on the experiences of the past few days and what he had learned.The seventh
                                            day would be to deal with any administrative matters of the Peerless
                                            Battalion. As for the communication with the TianBei City and Lin TianAo,
                                            and any other things, he would leave it to Shangguan Fei’er.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er would bring back any goods that Lin TianAo had bought, as
                                            well as any completed Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing began his arduous journey of training. He had four Jewels, six
                                            Attributes, twenty four Skills. Amongst the twenty four Skills, besides the
                                            few that had already gone through the Tempering, and a few that were not
                                            able to go through such training like the Dragon Silencing Seal, Demonic
                                            Dragon God Seal and the Time Reversal Skills, the rest needed the training.
                                            According to his training schedule of seven days per cycle, the three months
                                            would be just nice for him to temper his Skills once through.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing first started on this training method, Shangguan Fei’er was
                                            still rather approving. The Thousand Tempering Method was known to all, but
                                            no one had such a great effect like Zhou Weiqing. After all, due to his
                                            Immortal Deity Technique caused his Heavenly Energy recovery rate to be far
                                            faster than any ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master, and he could use his Skills
                                            far faster than others. As such, he could complete the Tempering Training in
                                            just five days, and as long as he could withstand the torturous five days,
                                            the effect would be extremely great.</p>
                                        <p>However, after just two cycles, Shangguan Fei’er’s heart began to ache for
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>In just that two weeks, Zhou Weiqing had lost weight noticeably, though not
                                            emancipated, he was clearly a lot thinner, having lost at least five jin or
                                            more. Although he still looked energetic, the normally huge musculature of
                                            him seemed an entire size smaller.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er had also tried to stop him from continuing, but deep in this
                                            hellish training, Zhou Weiqing refused to stop at all. She knew that once
                                            someone had set their resolve to undergo such a training, if they stopped it
                                            halfway, they would most likely be unable to muster the courage to go
                                            through it again. For Zhou Weiqing’s sake, she could only hold herself back
                                            from stopping him forcibly, watching from the side with an aching heart.</p>
                                        <p>However, she also tried to do her best to help with what she could.</p>
                                        <p>Each tempering cycle of Zhou Weiqing’s was seven days, and before every fifth
                                            day had ended, Shangguan Fei’er started to prepare food for him.</p>
                                        <p>Normally, she would leave earlier, and no one else would know where she went,
                                            and she would return with a hunted Heavenly Beast and brew some meat stew
                                            for Zhou Weiqing, adding some ground Heavenly Core and some medicines that
                                            she had brought out from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. After which, she would
                                            make some simple porridge from the stew, so that the meat would be cooked
                                            until it was extremely soft. When Zhou Weiqing came out of his training, he
                                            would be immediately be greeted with a fragrant and delicious bowl of
                                            nourishing meat porridge, helping him recover.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, while Zhou Weiqing was training, she would continuously help
                                            replenish the water if he finished it, and she also added some Heavenly Core
                                            mixture she had prepared, helping to keep him as nourished as possible
                                            during the process.</p>
                                        <p>In this way, the severe slimming of Zhou Weiqing was reduced. Although he
                                            still grew skinnier, but with her detailed and thoughtful care, Zhou Weiqing
                                            remained much better after each cycle of training.</p>
                                        <p>In such a way, three months passed by in a flash, and Zhou Weiqing’s training
                                            had come to an end.</p>
                                        <p>A long shrill cry rang out from Zhou Weiqing’s tent, a ferocious roar like a
                                            tiger claiming ownership of a mountain. All the horses in the Peerless
                                            Battalion Camp fell to the ground, shuddering.</p>
                                        <p>In the middle of teaching the Peerless Battalion soldiers, Shangguan Fei’er
                                            looked up with a look of pleased surprise on her face. Without hesitation,
                                            she ran towards Zhou Weiqing’s tent. This was the last time, and she had
                                            already prepared the meat porridge earlier.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion soldiers in the midst of training immediately beamed
                                            happily, but none of them dared to laugh at Shangguan Fei’er. They were
                                            clear that everytime Zhou Weiqing completed a cycle of training, their
                                            drillmaster would be extremely happy, and today the last twenty five would
                                            be saved from a beating.</p>
                                        <p>In this last three months, Shangguan Fei’er had already forged a position of
                                            absolute authority and respect in the Peerless Battalion, perhaps even above
                                            that of Zhou Weiqing. The ruffians of the Peerless Battalion were all
                                            utterly convinced in their hearts about Shangguan Fei’er’s power, but the
                                            real reason why the were so willing to listen to Shangguan Fei’er was not
                                            just because of her power and violence, but more importantly because of what
                                            she had taught them.</p>
                                        <p>In just three months, each and every one of the Peerless Battalion soldiers
                                            could clap their chests and guarantee that their close combat capabilities
                                            now were like heaven and earth compared to previously. Currently, no matter
                                            any one of the soldiers of the Peerless Battalion, if brought out to any of
                                            the normal armies, could definitely defeat any of their Company Leaders.</p>
                                        <p>They had felt their strength and power grow and escalate as the days passed
                                            through the tough training. Although it was definitely tougher than anything
                                            they had experienced before, they could only accept it. Furthermore, the
                                            fighting styles that Shangguan Fei’er taught them seemed to have a great
                                            effect on Heavenly Energy cultivation, and many of the Physical Jewel
                                            Masters of the Peerless Battalion had actually advanced to their next stage
                                            of cultivation level.</p>
                                        <p>As for the seven masters of the Heavenly Bow Unit, they too took turns to
                                            learn from Shangguan Fei’er. One could imagine how great the close combat
                                            skills that Shangguan Fei’er were teaching.</p>
                                        <p>Not caring about shy about it, Shangguan Fei’er quickly ran back to the camp.
                                            From Zhou Weiqing’s loud cry, she could easily tell that his Heavenly Energy
                                            had improved once more.</p>
                                        <p>After all, after that previous ‘accident’, Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation level
                                            had just raised up to the seventeenth stage, or the fifth stage of the
                                            Heavenly Shen Energy. At that level, it was already much slower to raise up
                                            each rank of Heavenly Energy. However, with the Immortal Deity Technique,
                                            Zhou Weiqing was definitely extremely ‘disgusting’, and just within this
                                            short three months, he had not only stabilized his fifth stage of Heavenly
                                            Shen Energy, he had actually broken through to the sixth stage! As such, he
                                            was only two stages away from the five-Jewel cultivation stage.</p>
                                        <p>With just a quick comparison to herself regarding Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation
                                            speed, she realised that after leaving the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she had
                                            not even raised a level of Heavenly Energy cultivation level. At that point,
                                            her Heavenly Energy was at the twenty seventh stage, just a single stage
                                            away from the seven-Jeweled stage. According to her own estimations, in
                                            order to breakthrough to that stage, it would take her at least half a year
                                            to a year to do so. Although that was because entering the Heavenly Xu
                                            Energy Stage meant each stage was even tougher and slower to raise, but she
                                            had already been at this stage for more than six months. Just from this
                                            alone, one could see how insanely fast Zhou Weiqing was raising his
                                            cultivation level. If he continued at such a speed, perhaps he would even
                                            reach the five-Jeweled stage within the year.</p>
                                        <p>One Jewel per year… such a speed was definitely inconceivable to any Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters!</p>
                                        <p>Taking a step out of his tent, Zhou Weiqing felt his legs a little wobbly.
                                            After all, he hadn’t eaten for five days, and no matter how nourishing the
                                            water was, it was still just water!</p>
                                        <p>His nose twitched slightly, and he could smell the familiar scent of the meat
                                            porridge, and his stomach rumbled loudly in response.</p>
                                        <p>“Dearest, come quick, I’m starving to death!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er carried a small pot of meat porridge as she walked towards
                                            him, saying: “You deserve it! Who asked you to train like that. Eat up.” As
                                            she said that, she passed him a bowl of porridge.</p>
                                        <p>“Ahh that smells so good… just a bit too little.” Zhou Weiqing gulped down
                                            the entire bowl of porridge, which had already been brought down to the
                                            right temperature. Instantly, a warm feeling started to spread through his
                                            body. Although he did not know what Shangguan Fei’er had added to the
                                            porridge, he knew that the reason why he was able to raise a stage of
                                            Heavenly Energy in just three months was not just because of his tough
                                            training, but also because of the porridge and water she prepared for him
                                            for the past few months.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said: “You have not eaten for five days, how can you
                                            suddenly eat too much?” The small pot of meat porridge was the best essence
                                            of all the food and medicines, but it could only fill three small bowls. It
                                            would definitely not fill his stomach, but it was more meant to nourish and
                                            reawaken Zhou Weiqing’s physiology. After a bit of time for recovery, he
                                            would be able to eat properly without harming himself.</p>
                                        <p>Finishing the three bowls of porridge swiftly, Zhou Weiqing collapsed onto
                                            the ground, not caring about his image.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er kept the bowls and pot, saying: “So, how did it all go? Did
                                            you finish training all your Skills?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Yup, I did! I finally completed all the tempering. You
                                            were right indeed, I really had just too little understanding of all my
                                            Skills. This three months might have been a tough and torturous time, but it
                                            was definitely worth it. I feel like I have totally been reborn. Oh right,
                                            how has the registration for the trading to the WanShou Empire gone?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said: “Relax, I personally went to look for that Legion
                                            Commander Shen Ji, and everything has been arranged properly. We can leave
                                            at any time, and I have also brought Lin TianAo and the others here to stay
                                            here in preparation.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing abruptly flipped himself over, pulling Shangguan Fei’er into his
                                            embrace and giving her a gentle kiss on the side of her beautiful face.
                                            “Dearest, you are really a great wife.”</p>
                                        <p>Getting kissed so suddenly, Shangguan Fei’er blushed a deep pink, struggling
                                            a bit but not succeeding in breaking free, she gave him a light punch on the
                                            shoulder. “You haven’t bathed for five days, so stinky! Hurry up and go
                                            bathe. Since you have finished your training, you’ll need to be updated on
                                            the status of the Peerless Battalion. I’ll go get the others.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had just eaten the delicious porridge and the warm feeling was
                                            making him feel rather lazy, but he knew he had to get up to wash up and he
                                            clambered to his feet.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er walked away a few steps, then stopped suddenly. Turning
                                            around abruptly, she said to him: “There is something else I have to tell
                                            you, someone has come from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.”</p>
                                        <p>“En?” Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in surprise: “They already know you are
                                            here?”</p>
                                        <p></p>
