                                            tentacle, shocking him til his hair stood up as if he had been fried, as
                                            white smoke rose from around him.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s second arrow reached him. This time, Little
                                            Four was unable to react due him being controlled. Without any other option,
                                            he could only use his skills defensively, and a small and exquisite looking
                                            shield appeared in front of his chest, and a layer of silver light also
                                            shone forth around him. At the same time, he struggled to break free of the
                                            black tentacles.</p>
                                        <p>With a huge explosion, the Overlord Bow’s arrow had a powerful piercing
                                            strength, added to its inbuilt explosive capabilities, the silver light
                                            around Little Four shattered. The strangest thing was that his body seemed
                                            to freeze, and the little shield and the wings behind his back both
                                            disappeared, and he plummeted down from the skies.</p>
                                        <p>At nearly a height of a hundred yards, if he really fell down, it would
                                            definitely kill him.</p>
                                        <p>These two arrows of Zhou Weiqing’s might seem rather simple, but in truth
                                            there were many profound subtle secrets and foresight hidden behind them.
                                            When Little Four flew into the air, Zhou Weiqing had already guessed that he
                                            would have some sort of escape or dodging powers. As such, his first arrow
                                            had been imbued with two area of effect (AOE) skills.</p>
                                        <p>One was of course the AOE skill, the Touch of Darkness, and the other was his
                                            only AOE attacking skill, Thousand Lightning Strikes. Both were not very
                                            powerful, but their strength lay in their large area of effect.</p>
                                        <p>As expected, Little Four had an evasion skill, and it was even Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            favourite Blink skill. However, even the Blink skill was not sufficient to
                                            bring him out of the range of the Touch of Darkness’ area of effect, and he
                                            had been caught and bound at the edge. The next Thousand Lightning Strikes
                                            had then hit him, and although it wasn’t sufficient to even harm him a
                                            little, it had numbed him for a split second, causing the Heavenly Energy in
                                            his body to lose control for a short time.</p>
                                        <p>That short period of time was more than sufficient for Zhou Weiqing’s second
                                            arrow to reach him, and both effects combined were more than enough to cause
                                            Little Four to be unable to dodge it, and could only block it. However, by
                                            that time, no matter what defense he put up was already pointless. That was
                                            because that second arrow had been imbued with two Absolute skills -
                                            Absolute Delay and the Heavenly Lightning Shock. The Absolute Delay would
                                            ensure that Little Four would remained controlled even if he managed to
                                            break free of the Touch of Darkness, while the Heavenly Lightning Shock
                                            would instantly break the Consolidated Wings and Shield that he was using.
                                            Men were not birds after all, and without the wings, no matter how powerful
                                            Little Four was, he would be helpless in midair. His genius plan of flying
                                            into the sky had been great, but ultimately been his downfall.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo sighed before taking action, and in a flash, he reached the bottom
                                            of Little Four’s falling body. With a wave of his right hand, he caught
                                            Little Four’s body, accepting the force of the fall on his behalf and
                                            protecting him.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing did not try to stop him. By this time, the victor was
                                            clear.</p>
                                        <p>Everyone’s gaze turned to the Overlord Bow in Zhou Weiqing’s hands, and
                                            besides Shangguan Bing’er and Lin TianAo who knew the truth, the rest of
                                            them instantly thought that the miraculous two arrows that Zhou Weiqing had
                                            shot forth was likely effects from this Consolidated Equipment Bow. None of
                                            them had expected Little Four to lose so easily, so quickly… it hadn’t even
                                            been three moves… to be accurate, he had lost in just two moves!</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao’s jaw had dropped by now, his mouth gaped open large enough to
                                            fit an apple, his eyes bulging from their sockets. Crow was rubbing her eyes
                                            in disbelief, as if trying to reassure herself that she was not having
                                            visions. As for Xiao Yan, his brow was furrowed as he studied Zhou Weiqing,
                                            as if deep in thought.</p>
                                        <p>The effects of the skills on Little Four vanished by now, although his hair
                                            was still standing up from the lightning strike, giving him a strange
                                            appearance.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing released his Overlord Bow, smiling as he said: “Thanks for
                                            giving way, I never expected my luck to be so good, Senior Little Four
                                            actually knew I was an archer, and flew into the air to become my
                                            target.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo helped Little Four to his feet, who stared dazedly at Zhou
                                            Weiqing. Jumping up suddenly, he cried out angrily: “I was tricked, I can’t
                                            accept such a loss!” Everything had happened so quickly, and he had not even
                                            used any of his power before losing. He wasn’t even clear about how he lost,
                                            how could he feel convinced by the loss. After all, this was to do with his
                                            lifelong freedom!”</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a deep and powerful voice rang out from the main
                                            building. “TianAo, why are you all still standing around instead of leaving?
                                            Did a fight occur?”</p>
                                        <p>The voice gave them a rather intangible feel, seemingly coming from all
                                            directions. Everyone could clearly hear it although it wasn’t shouted, and
                                            could sense it came from the general direction of the main building, but
                                            could not tell its source.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing the voice, a notion popped into Zhou Weiqing’s mind as his eyes
                                            swirled around their sockets, and he made a quick decision.</p>
                                        <p>“Senior Little Four, just now we were just playing some jokes on each other.
                                            Let’s hurry up and get a move on. Look, your academy teachers are already
                                            angry.”</p>
                                        <p>Little Four started, and Drunken Bao also recovered his composure. “Joke?
                                            What joke?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “I was saying, that bet earlier was
                                            just a joke. We still have to attend the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, how can
                                            we let such matters affect our relations, after all we have to work together
                                            for the next three months. Leader Lin, shall we move out then?”</p>
                                        <p>Seven surprised gazes fell upon Zhou Weiqing as everyone fell silent in
                                            shock. After all, that bet was clearly Zhou Weiqing’s win, yet under such a
                                            circumstance he had chosen to give it up? Drunken Bao and Little Four were
                                            some of the most talented and outstanding amongst the Heavenly Jewel Master
                                            Academy students, and at their ages reaching Lower Level and Mid Level Zun
                                            Stage respectively, how could anyone possibly give up such Followers? Yet,
                                            Zhou Weiqing had done so!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged and said: “Why are you all staring at me? I’m just
                                            speaking the truth! I’m just a student, why would I need a Follower now? I
                                            was just itching to try my hand earlier, and I was indeed just too lucky. In
                                            terms of real power, I am definitely weaker than Senior Little Four. This
                                            matter is over then, although we did swear an oath, but I can release you
                                            both from your oaths. Leader Lin, what are we still waiting for, let’s
                                            go!”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Drunken Bao and Little Four felt as if they
                                            were lucky survivors of some disaster. Even though Little Four had jumped up
                                            earlier and shouted out that he couldn’t accept such a loss, his heart had
                                            already sank to his stomach. After all, he knew inside he had lost, and with
                                            both sides having taken their oath, and with the fair Lin TianAo as the
                                            judge, he knew he had no choice but to become Zhou Weiqing’s Follower. Who
                                            knew that Zhou Weiqing would suddenly release them from their oaths. In that
                                            instant, both Little Four and Drunken Bao had an embarrassed look on their
                                            faces, as they remained quiet.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo looked deeply at Zhou Weiqing before nodding and said: “Alright,
                                            let’s move out then.”</p>
                                        <p>As the eight of them headed out of the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy, each of
                                            them were still immersed in the events of the past few minutes. No one could
                                            understand what Zhou Weiqing was thinking.</p>
                                        <p>In his heart, Zhou Weiqing gave a cold laugh. The real reason he had changed
                                            his mind was because of the sudden voice questioning them. That voice had
                                            given him a chill, not only letting him feel how unbelievably powerful that
                                            person was, definitely not someone he could handle, and also given him a
                                            reminding jolt of where he was right now.</p>
                                        <p>This was the Fei Li Empire, right in the middle of the Heavenly Jewel Master
                                            Academy! In this place, there were the most outstanding and powerful
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters of the entire Empire, and even more so, the Skill
                                            Storing Palace Master, the Principal of the Heavenly Jewel Master
                                            Academy!</p>
                                        <p>Clearly, their fight had drawn the attention of someone powerful, and if he
                                            insisted on making Little Four and Drunken Bao his Followers, they would
                                            have to remain in the school for quite some time. If any teachers, or worse,
                                            the Principal, came to investigate what happened, would they allow it to
                                            continue? For their Academy’s most outstanding students to become someone
                                            else’s Followers, who could stand for such a thing to happen! Even if Zhou
                                            Weiqing really managed to get the two of them as Followers, it might have
                                            future repercussions. Most importantly, Zhou Weiqing was afraid that Lin
                                            TianAo’s situation might be found out. In his heart, even adding both Little
                                            Four and Drunken Bao together, they were nothing compared to Lin TianAo in
                                            his heart. As such, he would not risk it being found out and disrupted just
                                            to gain two Followers.</p>
                                        <p>Another reason was of course because of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. If
                                            Little Four and Drunken Bao became his Followers like this, perhaps the
                                            relations between the eight might become strained, and definitely affect
                                            their unity and teamwork. Drunken Bao and Little Four might even be affected
                                            adversely and not be able to perform in fights. That was something Zhou
                                            Weiqing did not want to see.</p>
                                        <p>Although these two Heavenly Jewel Masters were powerful and talented, in Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s mind, their importance was much less than Yun Li, let alone
                                            LinTianAo. Besides, no matter how important they were, he did not want to
                                            risk his Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel being discovered by anyone else.</p>
                                        <p>After all, the Touch of Darkness and Thousand Lightning Strikes were very
                                            obvious skills, and it might lead to the discovery of him having the
                                            Darkness and Lightning Attributes. If he continued staying in the academy
                                            grounds, who knew what else might be discovered. As long as they quickly
                                            left, Zhou Weiqing was confident in keeping it a secret. After all, no
                                            matter what, Little Four and Drunken Bao would owe him a big favour.</p>
                                        <p>With all of that in mind, Zhou Weiqing had quickly decided to give up the
                                            opportunity to gain two new powerful Followers.</p>
                                        <p>Just as the eight of them left the Academy grounds, right on the top of the
                                            main school building, a red robed old man walked to the window, looking at
                                            them their fading figures with a pondering look on his face.</p>
                                        <p>“The fluctuation of Heavenly Energy isn’t very strong, but it contained the
                                            Darkness and Lightning Attributes… both extremely rare and useful
                                            attributes. It looks like this time Princess Cai Cai has found some gems,
                                            with two of the three members having such rare attributes. Too bad they did
                                            not join our Heavenly Jewel Master Academy.”</p>
