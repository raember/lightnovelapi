                                            Adding your ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set… all of these together,
                                            even I am not certain to what degree the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation
                                            Arts can bring you to.”</p>
                                        <p>As he spoke up to this point, Long Shiya’s words turned grave and earnest.
                                            “Furthermore, these Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts were created by
                                            your Master, me. However, your talent is not below mine at all… don’t you
                                            think you can have the ambition to further improve it? I believe that the
                                            future of the world is in your hands. In less than twenty years, I doubt
                                            that anyone in the entire Boundless Mainland will be a match for you. The
                                            target I have set for you is to reach the Heavenly King Stage before the age
                                            of thirty, Heavenly Emperor before the age of forty. Beyond that… that will
                                            depend on yourself.”</p>
                                        <p>Yes, Master. I will definitely not disappoint you.” In Long Shiya’s eyes,
                                            Zhou Weiqing could see a deep affection and appreciation. He knew that
                                            although his Master often made fun of him, saying he was stupid or things
                                            like that… in truth, he was extremely satisfied with him.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, although Zhou Weiqing did not speak of it, it did not mean
                                            he did not know how well Long Shiya treated him. For his sake, his master
                                            had spent so much time and effort to bring him all the way here, spending
                                            all the time here with him protecting him as he Awakened his Solidified
                                            Dragon Spirit. For his sake, his Master would even bring him up to the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain… he knew that although Long Shiya seemed to be
                                            dismissive of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, how could he not know the danger
                                            of doing so? It was the strongest powerhouse in the entire world after
                                            all!</p>
                                        <p>For him, Long Shiya had even sacrificed his own reputation, going against his
                                            own conscience to grab Little Witch for him. Although these past few days
                                            Zhou Weiqing had been fully caught up in testing his body’s new limits as
                                            well as training, and he had not had time to think about his emotions,
                                            feelings or relationships. However, everything else aside, even if it were
                                            just for his Master’s reputation, he could not possibly abandon Little
                                            Witch. After all, he had been the one who had stolen her virtue, conscious
                                            or not.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst all of Zhou Weiqing’s teachers, the one he had spent the least time
                                            with was Huyan Aobo, the longest time, Mu En. However, the one who had truly
                                            touched him the most was Long Shiya. In truth, his feelings for Long Shiya
                                            now were more like father and son, and this newest teacher of his was not
                                            nearly as strict as his father’s steel-like personality.</p>
                                        <p>As such, Zhou Weiqing might have only spoken a very simple sentence, a simple
                                            promise. However, that pledge was filled with his determination. He would
                                            not let Long Shiya down, no matter what. Otherwise, how could he be worthy
                                            of all that his Master and all that he had done for him?</p>
                                        <p>In the subsequent time, Long Shiya started officially teaching Zhou Weiqing
                                            about all the profound secrets of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts.
                                            Just the theory alone took him more than a day to pass on, and what followed
                                            next was personally teaching every technique and trick to the entire Six
                                            Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, helping Zhou Weiqing structure his own
                                            personal Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation.</p>
                                        <p>It was far more difficult to construct Zhou Weiqing’s personal Six Ultimate
                                            Skill Manipulation Formation than Long Shiya had expected. Originally, when
                                            he had constructed his Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation, due to his
                                            six Attributes all being elemental in nature, it was relatively easier to
                                            stabilize. Although the Light and Darkness attributes were stronger than the
                                            other four Attributes, they were opposing in nature, allowing them to form
                                            the two apex of the formation to maintain stability.</p>
                                        <p>However, for Zhou Weiqing’s situation, it was different. What were his six
                                            Attributes? Wind, Lightning, Darkness, Spatial, Demonic and Time.</p>
                                        <p>Of the six Attributes, besides the Wind Attribute, the other five were not
                                            ordinary at all. The Lightning Attribute was considered a ‘mutated’
                                            Attribute of sorts, while Darkness and Spatial were all Greater Attributes,
                                            while Demonic and Time were Saint Attributes. It was definitely not easy to
                                            find a balance.</p>
                                        <p>Without finding a right balance, a Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation
                                            that belonged to Zhou Weiqing could not be constructed. Yet, that balance
                                            point was just too difficult to find.</p>
                                        <p>The Time and Demonic Attributes might both be Saint Attributes, but unlike
                                            the Light and Darkness Attributes, they were not polar attributes that could
                                            play off each other. Instead, they could be said to have no relation at all,
                                            and could not be used as apex points. It was the same case for the Spatial
                                            and Darkness Attributes.</p>
                                        <p>For a time, even Long Shiya was stuck, totally at a loss.</p>
                                        <p>In that critical moment, suddenly inspiration struck Zhou Weiqing. He finally
                                            thought of something… since their situation differed so much between him and
                                            Long Shiya, perhaps their actual Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation
                                            had to be different as well. After some serious pursuing of that line of
                                            thought, he came up with an idea.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya’s Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation was an equilateral
                                            hexagon, and the idea that Zhou Weiqing had would have his own formation
                                            taking a different shape… a star-shaped hexagon of two triangles stacked
                                            upon the other.</p>
                                        <p>Why two triangles? The reason was naturally because of the word balance once
                                            more. Within Zhou Weiqing’s Six Attributes, there were two Saint Attributes,
                                            two Greater Attributes, and two relatively ‘normal’ Attributes.</p>
                                        <p>Since there was no way to apply a balance from the Attributes themselves,
                                            with no link between any of his Attributes, Zhou Weiqing decided he might as
                                            well keep them separated. The Lightning, Darkness and Demonic Attributes in
                                            a group to form the first triangle, and the Wind, Spatial and Time
                                            Attributes together in the second group to form another triangle.</p>
                                        <p>This arrangement was not at random as well. Simply put, the Demonic Attribute
                                            and Darkness Attribute did share some commonalities, and the Time and
                                            Spatial Attributes did so as well.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Lightning Attribute, since it came from the Dark Demon God along
                                            with the Darkness and Demonic Attributes, he decided to put them together.
                                            Similarly for the Wind Attribute, it was what he often worked together with
                                            Spatial and Time Attribute for Consolidating Equipment Master work, and that
                                            was a tentative relationship at least. Once the six Attributes were
                                            separated as such, the each of the two triangles could form a balance within
                                            themselves. Once the two triangles were stacked together to form the
                                            star-shaped hexagon, the center would automatically form an ordinary
                                            equilateral hexagon shape as well, allowing the Six Ultimate Skill
                                            Manipulation Formation to fall into place neatly.</p>
                                        <p>When Long Shiya heard Zhou Weiqing’s idea, he was so surprised that his jaw
                                            almost dropped. Although he did not know if this could work, he was certain
                                            that just from theory alone, this had a high probability of working.</p>
                                        <p>The most important thing for the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts was
                                            balance, and since Zhou Weiqing had found his own balance between his six
                                            Attributes, it was definitely worth giving it a shot. In Long Shiya’s own
                                            experiments, his personal Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation had to
                                            be an equilateral hexagon before it worked… but his attributes were very
                                            different from Zhou Weiqing. Who was to say that Zhou Weiqing’s star-shaped
                                            hexagon could not succeed? Perhaps, it might even have a better effect?</p>
                                        <p>As such, the master and disciple pair started a fresh round of
                                            experiments.</p>
                                        <p>Despite being unfamiliar with the entire process, Zhou Weiqing had Long Shiya
                                            guiding him from the side, even using his own Heavenly Energy to guide in
                                            the process, and it was much easier to form the basic structure in such a
                                            case. Even so, they experienced failure after failure. The reason was simple
                                            - forming the two triangles were simple, but when stacking them together, it
                                            had to be perfectly precise. Even with Long Shiya’s help, it was not easy
                                            for Zhou Weiqing to do so.</p>
                                        <p>“Master, do you think we can actually succeed?” After yet another failure,
                                            Zhou Weiqing finally said, dejection and unreconciled vexation in his
                                            eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya glanced at him and said: “Do not ask me. Ask yourself. In this
                                            world, nothing is impossible. It is just a matter of how much we are willing
                                            to put in, what price we are willing to pay when doing something.
                                            Originally, when I first came up with my Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation
                                            Arts, I did not have anyone to teach me, and I could only slowly structure
                                            my personal Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation at a painstakingly
                                            slow speed, fumbling my way in the darkness and slowly perfecting it. Did
                                            you think it was easy even forming an equilateral hexagon formation? It took
                                            me five years of my life, working full time on it, to finally complete it.
                                            Compared to me, you have far fewer wrong paths to tread upon. If you are
                                            going to give up just after a few days, then perhaps you are not worthy of
                                            these arts after all.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s heart gripped in stern warning, and he bowed, saying: “Master,
                                            I am wrong. Let us continue.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya nodded. The most satisfactory part about Zhou Weiqing was that he
                                            would not dwell on things, able to listen to other’s opinions and
                                            suggestions.</p>
                                        <p>The six Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewels swirled around Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            left wrist, glowing brilliantly. Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath and
                                            centered himself once more, focusing hard as the wings spread out behind his
                                            back, beating gently. The various Attribute Heavenly Energy in the
                                            atmosphere also swirled around, welling into his body.</p>
                                        <p>Abruptly, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes lit up. With a slight flick of his left hand,
                                            the six slowly spinning Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewels sped up, floating up
                                            into the air, each of them undergoing a different change.</p>
                                        <p>These few days of tough training was not without any results. At least, to
                                            this beginning procedure, Zhou Weiqing was already extremely familiar.</p>
                                        <p>The Six Alexandrite Cat’s Eye  turned into different colours, according to
                                            the various Attributes. The rubellite representing Wind, Emperor Sapphire
                                            representing Lightning, the chrysoberyl cat's eye representing Spatial,
                                            black opal for Darkness, and lastly an unknown grey gemstone that
                                            represented the Demonic Attribute and a translucent, almost transparent
                                            gemstone representing time.</p>
                                        <p>The Six Elemental Jewels glowed brilliantly in their respective colours,
                                            floating before Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>No matter Physical Jewels or Elemental Jewels, to any Heavenly Jewel Master,
                                            they were their most important Personal Power Jewels, and could be said to
                                            be part of their own bodies. Forcing their Personal Power Jewels to leave
                                            their bodies like that was quite a dangerous act; not only did it require a
                                            large amount of Heavenly Energy to do so, it also required sufficient
                                            spiritual energy to control it.</p>
                                        <p>Under the control of Zhou Weiqing’s will and Heavenly Energy, the six
                                            Elemental Jewels slowly split into two groups, forming two triangles; with
                                            each group floating in front of Zhou Weiqing on either side. Currently, his
                                            brow was matted with sweat, which poured down the side of his face as he was
                                            in full concentration.</p>
                                        <p>Very slowly, very carefully, Zhou Weiqing started moving the two groups
                                            simultaneously to the center, right in front of him. Floating above was the
                                            single triangle, and below the other in reverse. Soon after, the two slowly
                                            floated towards each other.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, the success or failure of the formation was all in a single key
                                            instant. Besides his own control, there was a measure of luck involved as
                                            well. Not only to maintain the balance between all six Elemental Jewels, but
                                            also for the six Attributes to actually form the Six Ultimate Skill
                                            Manipulation Formations and start operating at the same time in unison.</p>
                                        <p>The process of forming the structure was actually not complicated at all, but
                                            success was definitely not easily achieved. In the past few days alone, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had already tried more than a hundred times. Every time, he always
                                            felt like he was about to succeed, but it always resulted in failure at the
                                            last possible second. Such a feeling was extremely terrible indeed, each and
                                            every time a continued blow to his confidence.</p>
                                        <p>However, having just listened to his Master’s lecture, Zhou Weiqing’s faith
                                            had been renewed, and conviction blazed in his eyes once again. As the two
                                            triangles came together slowly, one could sense the various different fields
                                            of energy each of the six Elemental Jewels were emitting, and the forced
                                            warping as they approached each other.</p>
