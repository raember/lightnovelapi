                                            However, when the silver light enveloped him, his speed actually rose to a
                                            whole new level, his entire body like a shuttle, piercing through the
                                            air.</p>
                                        <p>The Wind Attribute Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master had just released his
                                            Consolidated Shield, and a silver light flashed before his eyes. He had not
                                            even seen what had happened clearly, and all he felt as a sudden cold
                                            invading his entire body.</p>
                                        <p>Breaking Shield, Instant Death.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s body appeared behind the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master.
                                            His speed had just been too fast, and he had only activated it when he was
                                            already near the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master. As such, the two
                                            Skills from his enemies that had been locked onto Zhou Weiqing actually
                                            smashed onto the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master as well.</p>
                                        <p>An ear splitting slicing sound rang out, but no screams of pain resounded
                                            together. In truth, the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master had already
                                            lost the ability to scream as soon as Zhou Weiqing passed right through
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>Struck by both the Demonic Wind Ring and Purple Yin Flames, the final end of
                                            the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master was no better than the previous
                                            Strength Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, with nothing much left of him but
                                            pieces.</p>
                                        <p>The Skill that Zhou Weiqing had used was the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce,
                                            and it was the Fourth Wind Attribute Skill that he had Stored. [1. It’s been
                                            a while, so quick reminder: First seen in Chapter 39.1, Wind Attribute Skill
                                            of the Silver Emperor Heavenly Beast.]</p>
                                        <p>Ever since Zhou Weiqing had met with the Silver Emperor in the Fei Li City’s
                                            Skill Storing Palace, he had been greatly attracted by the Silver Emperor
                                            Lightning Pierce; it was after all one of the Silver Emperor’s three great
                                            skills. Alas, at that time, he could only choose two out of its three
                                            Skills, and he had no choice but to give it up then. This time, when he had
                                            reached the Four-Jeweled cultivation level, he had managed to find another
                                            Silver Emperor in the Heavenly Jewel Island Skill Storing Palace, and he had
                                            succeeded in Storing it this time. As such, he now had all three of a Silver
                                            Emperor’s greatest skills.</p>
                                        <p>The Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce: Wind Attribute Skill of the Silver
                                            Emperor. Able to warp into a silver point, instantly piercing through
                                            anything. At the same time, moving at 300% speed. This is a skill that can
                                            be used for both offense and defense, and the Silver Emperor uses it for
                                            both attacking and fleeing</p>
                                        <p>The reason why Zhou Weiqing chose it was not just because of its unbelievable
                                            piercing powers, but also because of that instantaneous burst of speed it
                                            granted. Of course, at his power levels, that would only last for an
                                            extremely short period, but in a critical moment, it could actually help
                                            save his life as well if used to flee.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was very clear about his own situation, and the sheer danger he
                                            was in. He knew that he had to plan for the worst, and as such, when he
                                            reached the Four-Jeweled stage, in choosing his new Skills to Store, he had
                                            placed a greater importance on Skill that could help protect himself,
                                            especially when being hunted down by his enemies.</p>
                                        <p>The Tornado Strike in addition to the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce was an
                                            unbelievable boost to his speed and offensive capabilities, and with the
                                            Giant Spirit Yang Palm spearheading the attack, it was not something that
                                            could be easily taken on head-on by any ordinary six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master, unless one had a powerful offensive or defensive Skill to deal with
                                            it. Alas, his enemy was neither a close combat or defensive specialist.
                                            Their attacks were still chasing Zhou Weiqing, and needed to be controlled,
                                            but before they could hit, Zhou Weiqing had actually managed to kill a
                                            second enemy.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing naturally had his reasons for choosing the Wind Attribute
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master - he was the one who gave him the sense of being a
                                            greatest threat, especially after seeing that he had a Control Skill, and
                                            not just one. Zhou Weiqing might seem to be on the upper hand, with his
                                            myriad of powerful Skills, but he was also a careful person. He knew that if
                                            he got caught by any Control Skill, then he would be easily brought down and
                                            killed by an onslaught of attacks, outnumbered as he was. As such, after
                                            taking down his first enemy, he had quickly decided to finish off this Wind
                                            Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master next.</p>
                                        <p>The four remaining black clad men were dumbfounded. From the start of the
                                            fight, though so many things had happened, it had been only slightly more
                                            than ten seconds, and already two of their companions had been slaughtered.
                                            What Zhou Weiqing brought to them was a feeling that he could not be
                                            stopped.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing’s actions would not stop at that; after killing off
                                            the Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, he was not that far off from the
                                            Ranged Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, though they had tried to
                                            separate themselves.</p>
                                        <p>However, after using so many powerful Skills in rapid succession, the
                                            Heavenly Energy he had Devoured previously had been fully depleted, and even
                                            his own Heavenly Energy was almost used up.</p>
                                        <p>The Devour Skill was known as the most powerful Skill of the entire Demonic
                                            Attribute, and it truly deserved its name. Although it did not seem to have
                                            a great offensive power, it was without a doubt that it was this Skill alone
                                            that had helped Zhou Weiqing to face so many powerful enemies. Without it,
                                            the only choice he would have would be to run for his life. After all, no
                                            matter how powerful he was, he was at a lower level than them. Even if he
                                            could kill off one or two enemies with his many powerful highly rated
                                            Skills, he would quickly run out of Heavenly Energy. Despite having so many
                                            Skills at his disposal, once he ran out of Heavenly Energy, they would all
                                            be useless. Yet, with the Devour Skill, Zhou Weiqing was able to constantly
                                            replenish his energy in the midst of combat. As long as he managed to
                                            activate it on his enemies, he would be able to continuously fight at peak
                                            power and use these high powered Skills.</p>
                                        <p>Stamping his right foot on the ground, Zhou Weiqing shot forth like a
                                            cannonball towards his target, the Ranged Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s performance earlier had just been too impressive, and the Fire
                                            Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master was shocked and afraid. Quickly pointing his
                                            staff at the rapidly advancing Zhou Weiqing, he did not care about saving
                                            Heavenly Energy, swiftly launching three powerful Fire Attribute Skills one
                                            after the other at him.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, the two airborne enemies who had been blocked by Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            arrows finally landed onto the ground, and they charged forth from the back
                                            together with the melee Heavenly Jewel Master. In their eyes, Zhou Weiqing
                                            was only at the Four-Jeweled stage, and despite all his power, after
                                            unleashing so many powerful Skills, he had to be running low on Heavenly
                                            Energy. At this point, their confidence in killing off Zhou Weiqing was even
                                            higher.</p>
                                        <p>These three black clad men were obviously not well versed in ranged combat.
                                            Most Heavenly Jewel Masters would only specialize in one; taking Zhou
                                            Weiqing as an example, if one only considered his Skills alone, he did not
                                            have much ranged Skills at all. However, he had his outstanding archery to
                                            complement him, and with the Overlord Bow, he was able to more than offset
                                            this ‘weak point’ of his.</p>
                                        <p>The explosive power of the Demonic Right Leg was so strong, and it sent Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s body hurtling almost instantly into the midst of the Fire
                                            Attribute Skill, and he was just about to be struck by it without chance of
                                            evasion.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, all the remaining black clad men were surprised to see
                                            another dark glow aura spring up around Zhou Weiqing’s body, blocking all
                                            the Fire Attribute Skills. It was another Consolidating Equipment God
                                            Protective Aura!</p>
                                        <p>This time, what appeared was the Giant Spirit Yin Palm of the Yin Yang Giant
                                            Spirit Palms around his left arm. From the surface, it looked exactly the
                                            same as the Giant Spirit Yang Palm, dark gold coloured armor, with the glove
                                            area tipped with the sharp thick claws.</p>
                                        <p>With the aid of his second Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura, Zhou
                                            Weiqing was able to charge to the front of the Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master. Once a melee specialist Heavenly Jewel Master managed to close in
                                            onto a ranged specialist Heavenly Jewel Master, one could imagine the
                                            result; let alone with them having a prior example.</p>
                                        <p>However, it was Zhou Weiqing’s turn to be surprised. The Fire Attribute
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master did not look surprised or afraid, instead his lips
                                            turned upwards in a cold smirk. At that point, a thick burst of fire
                                            exploded out from his body, warping into a ring spreading outwards in all
                                            directions.</p>
                                        <p>The golden flames brought an intense heat, but more so a repulsive force that
                                            pushed backwards violently. It was the rare Fire Attribute protective Skill,
                                            shoving enemies away from oneself, one of the prime skills for ranged combat
                                            Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Masters. The Fire Ring of Repulsion Skill.</p>
                                        <p>A huge backward-pushing force repulsing all assailed him from all directions.
                                            This was a highly rated Skill powered by the six-Jeweled cultivation stage
                                            after all! With enemies behind him, and the Fire Ring of Repulsion blocking
                                            him from the front, Zhou Weiqing was momentarily in a dangerous state.</p>
                                        <p>A piercing silver light appeared without warning from Zhou Weiqing’s right
                                            palm, along with an earsplitting tearing sound across the air, reverberating
                                            across the area as a silver tear appeared, almost four yards along, ripping
                                            into the Fire Ring of Repulsion, causing the powerful backward force to
                                            slide past Zhou Weiqing harmlessly instead.</p>
                                        <p>Leaping up and contorting his body to squeeze through in a flash, Zhou
                                            Weiqing was abruptly in front of the Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master,
                                            his hands in front of his opponent’s horrified face. His palms smashed down
                                            onto each shoulder, and with the Giant Spirit Palm’s piercing power and
                                            sheer strength, along with the Demonic Change State’s physique, he instantly
                                            broke through the shield, and with an accompanying shriek of agony from the
                                            Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, he grabbed onto his shoulders
                                            forcibly.</p>
                                        <p>By now, the Fire Ring of Repulsion, originally meant to knock Zhou Weiqing
                                            away, was now a detriment and downfall to the Fire Attribute Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master, instead helping to keep his companions away, blocking the three
                                            black clad men. At this point, no one could save his life any longer.</p>
                                        <p>Such a massive expenditure of energy, Zhou Weiqing needed to replenish it as
                                            soon as possible in order to keep fighting, and immediately he activated the
                                            Devour Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Both side’s Heavenly Energy had a certain gap between them, but the Demonic
                                            Change State and Devour Skills had both been raised up to the four-Jeweled
                                            stage, and the Devour Skill’s draining rate had been raised drastically.
                                            Adding to that the boost from Zhou Weiqing’s Legendary Set’s Yin Yang Giant
                                            Spirit Palm, as well as the momentary dazed senses of the Fire Attribute
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master from having both shoulders smashed, he was not able to
                                            resist the Devour Skill.</p>
                                        <p>A large amount of Heavenly Energy flowed into Zhou Weiqing, re-nourishing his
                                            body and replenishing the substantial Heavenly Energy that he had already
                                            used in this short fight, almost topping him to full again. Although this
                                            Heavenly Energy did not belong to him, as long as he used it in a short
                                            period of time, it would be no different in terms of his combat
                                            strength.</p>
                                        <p>It was not just his Heavenly Energy which was Devoured, along with it came
                                            the black clad man’s life force as well. As the time passed, the difference
                                            in power between the two grew, and they could clearly see the black clad
                                            man’s body withering, starting from his shoulders. When that withering
                                            effect reached his chest, his heart was instantly torn apart by the two
                                            suction forces from both sides, and with a spurt of blood, the black clad
                                            man died.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s hatred for these Bai Da Empire enemies were at an all time
                                            high, and his attacks were savage and vicious. The Yin Yang Giant Spirit
                                            Palm pulled apart in an outward motion, tearing the enemy into two, before
                                            tossing his remains behind casually.</p>
                                        <p>Six versus one. Seemingly insurmountable odds. Yet, in just a short period of
                                            time, Zhou Weiqing had already killed off three enemies. What kind of
                                            terrifying power was that? As compared to when he had been in the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Tournament, Zhou Weiqing’s power had already increased by leaps and
                                            bounds, and facing these ordinary six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters, he was
                                            no longer had to fear them.</p>
