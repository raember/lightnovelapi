                                            temper and character. I do not want the possible name and reputation of
                                            being called a wife stealer. Furthermore, I have always kept my word on the
                                            things I said. I will overlook the fact that you lied to me, but do not look
                                            for me again. Otherwise, you know what will happen.” After leaving those
                                            words, he walked into the Skill Storing Palace without looking back, leaving
                                            the stunned Difuya standing in stupefaction.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s original good mood had been totally ruined by the meeting with
                                            Difuya, and walking along the Fei Li City’s streets, he felt rather irked
                                            and irritated. <i>Godfather ahh godfather, it’s not that I don’t want to
                                                give you face, but compared to Bing’er, I can never accept Difuya.</i>
                                            The last remaining guilt in his heart towards Di Fengling regarding
                                            dissolving the engagement had been wiped out now, and he shook his head
                                            vigorously. With a cold humph, he muttered to himself: “It’s not worth it to
                                            get angry over her!”</p>
                                        <p>However, having experienced the two clashes with a young mid level Zun Stage
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master, it made Zhou Weiqing feel his severe lack of power.
                                            That Ming Yu’s Heavenly Energy was likely at the eighth level of the
                                            Heavenly Shen Energy, and was a lot stronger than him. If not for the fact
                                            that Zhou Weiqing’s physical strength was extraordinary, he would likely
                                            have taken a bigger loss earlier.</p>
                                        <p>As he mused about what happened earlier, Zhou Weiqing looked for a nearby inn
                                            to stay. He decided to recover his Heavenly Energy first before
                                            Consolidating the Legendary Set Equipment Scroll that he had. He would head
                                            to the Skill Storing Palace again tomorrow; with his Immortal Deity
                                            Technique’s fast recovery rate, he would likely be able to attempt skill
                                            storing twice without any issues.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Two Days Later.</p>
                                        <p>The eastern part of the Fei Li City was originally already the most
                                            prosperous part, and it seemed especially crowded and lively today. This was
                                            especially so around the academy district which was close to the Skill
                                            Storing Palace, where there was a massive bustling crowd. The main reason
                                            being that today was the start of the annual registration date for many of
                                            the large academies.</p>
                                        <p>The registration period was 3 days in total, with each academy having a
                                            different intake number and requirements. However, there was just a single
                                            rule in the Fei Li Empire - no matter commoner or noble, all would have to
                                            take the respective academy’s registration tests before being able to
                                            join.</p>
                                        <p>There were over a dozen various academies, of which the most famous were the
                                            three top academies, namely: Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy, Fei Li
                                            Empire Heavenly Jewel Master Academy, and the Fei Li Palace Academy.</p>
                                        <p>Of which, the Fei Li Palace Academy was famed for being the place which had
                                            nurtured many top civil officials. They also had the most stringent
                                            requirements amongst all the academies, all their students were restricted
                                            to only Fei Li Empire Citizens, and there were 3 days worth of examinations
                                            with 9 in total, each on various different aspects. Only the cream of the
                                            crop would be admitted. It also had the most registrations amongst all the
                                            academies, but their entrance rate was less than one in a hundred.</p>
                                        <p>Over 80% of the civil officials in the Fei Li Empire had graduated from this
                                            academy; from that you could tell the sheer amount of influence the academy
                                            had.</p>
                                        <p>On the other hand, the one with the relatively ‘easiest’, yet with the least
                                            amount of registrations, was the Fei Li Empire Heavenly Jewel Master
                                            Academy. There was only one requirement for registration - to be a Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master; while citizenship did not matter. However, if they were
                                            citizens of another empire, the requirement was to pledge allegiance to the
                                            Fei Li Empire. There were only a hundred or so current students in the
                                            academy, and it was usually considered good if they could get 8-10 new
                                            students every year. The Heavenly Jewel Master Academy was famed for being
                                            the cradle for cultivating many a powerful Heavenly Jewel Master. After all,
                                            the students in the academy were able to enter the Skill Storing Palace and
                                            go about Skill Storing for free during their study period. Such a favourable
                                            condition alone was more than sufficient to draw many young Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters to register.</p>
                                        <p>The final one was of course the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy. The
                                            registration numbers were usually about a third of the Fei Li Palace
                                            Academy, but their acceptance rate was much higher, about one in thirty, and
                                            they were famed for nurturing many famous generals and military officials.
                                            This was the academy which Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er were applying
                                            to join.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing arrived at the entrance of the Fei Li Imperial Family
                                            Military Academy early in the morning, he was dazed. The entire street was
                                            filled with people, how could he possibly look for Shangguan Bing’er in such
                                            a crowd! With no better idea, he could only stand helplessly near the queue,
                                            his gaze constantly scanning the crowd for a sign of Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>While he was waiting anxiously, all of a sudden, a young skinny youth sidled
                                            up to him and said: “Bro, want a copy of the examination requirements and
                                            rules? With this, you will be better prepared for the exams. This is only
                                            sold today, only 10 gold coins!”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the sheet of paper in his hands, Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly:
                                            “One sheet of paper and you’re trying to sell it for 10 gold coins? Why
                                            don’t you go rob someone.” Who knew that the skinny youth said: “How can
                                            robbing compare to doing this, this earns much more and is a lot safer.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but laugh at that. “Fine, give me one.” He was
                                            just standing here idly anyway. He had decided to just stand here; after all
                                            he was very tall at 1.9 metres, and was standing in a rather obvious place,
                                            so it would be a lot easier for Shangguan Bing’er to see him than for him to
                                            look for her.</p>
                                        <p>After paying the 10 gold coins for a copy of the rules, he stood there and
                                            opened it to read. After he looked at the contents of the paper, he
                                            instantly realised he had been cheated. The header of the paper’s contents
                                            was titled ‘General Regulation for Enrollment’. Clearly, this was given to
                                            everyone who registered, yet it had cheated him out of 10 gold coins.
                                            However, it would be impossible to look for the same person in the
                                            crowd.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was speechless for a second, thinking to himself: <i>If Old
                                            Scoundrel were here, he would scold me to death!</i></p>
                                        <p>In truth, the reason he got cheated wasn’t just because he was careless, but
                                            rather because he had been so anxious while waiting for Shangguan Bing’er,
                                            and feeling discomforted in his heart, he didn’t think much more.
                                            Furthermore, with several hundred thousand in his pocket, he naturally
                                            didn’t really care that much about the relative small sum of money.</p>
                                        <p>After header, the following was written: “After registration, applicants
                                            should bring their admission identification card and enter the academy to go
                                            through their exams. The exams are split into three portions, each worth a
                                            hundred marks. The tests are personal combat strength, written test on
                                            military knowledge, as well as a direct face to face interview. At the same
                                            time, it was also written that if someone managed to score full marks for
                                            any particular test, they could be admitted regardless of the results of
                                            their other two tests.</p>
                                        <p>Right below that were the required acceptance scored. For nobles, a total
                                            score of 150 was required, and for commoners, a total score of 180 was
                                            required.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he saw that, Zhou Weiqing’s brow couldn’t help but furrow. So much
                                            for the Fei Li Empire’s pretty words, that no matter status or rank, they
                                            would all have to take examinations. In the end, the differentiation was
                                            after the examinations. <i>I wonder if my rank of Viscount in the Heavenly
                                                Bow Empire counts as a noble or a commoner? </i>He thought to himself.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>“What are you looking at?” Just as Zhou Weiqing was examining the rules, he
                                            felt his shoulder get tapped by someone. As soon as he turned around, he was
                                            greeted by a beautiful smiling face. It was Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was stunned for a second, and in the next instant, he
                                            unhesitatingly pulled her into his arms, hugging her tightly, drawing the
                                            gazes of everyone nearby.</p>
                                        <p>From the time he had met Shangguan Bing’er up til now, this was the first
                                            time that he had parted with her for such a long period of time. Previously,
                                            while training with Huyan Aobo, the feeling had not been so obvious as he
                                            had been so focused on learning and practicing. However, when he left the
                                            Flying Hill City, his heart and mind had always been with Shangguan Bing’er.
                                            That was the reason why he had been so anxious just now. Furthermore, having
                                            met Difuya two days earlier, that strong contrast between the two had just
                                            made him miss Shangguan Bing’er more, making him wish he had wings and could
                                            fly to her there and then. Now that he was finally reunited with her, how
                                            could he not be excited.</p>
                                        <p>Being hugged all of a sudden, Shangguan Bing’er was very embarrassed.
                                            However, feeling his rapid heartbeat and the arms holding her tightly, the
                                            bashfulness in her heart softened, and she slowly hugged him back as well,
                                            feeling peace in her heart.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, the past few months were also uncomfortable for her. Previously,
                                            when Zhou Weiqing was by her side, she did not feel so strongly about it.
                                            After all, he often made her angry when he teased her. However, after he had
                                            left, she had been left in peace, but this peace just made her think of him
                                            all the time. Even though she spent most of her time accompanying her
                                            mother, she still felt rather restless and fidgety. If not for the fact she
                                            was afraid of affecting Zhou Weiqing from learning how to create
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, perhaps she would have gone to look for him
                                            earlier at the Flying Hill City.</p>
                                        <p>Earlier, she had seen Zhou Weiqing from the distance, standing there
                                            foolishly and looking around anxiously. At that moment, she had felt a
                                            warmth invading her heart, filling her with a sense of satisfaction that she
                                            had never had before. It had taken her some time to squeeze through the
                                            crowd to reach him.</p>
                                        <p>Now that they had reunited in the midst of the crowd, that sense of joy and
                                            excitement was released, and the two of them totally ignored the rest of the
                                            crowd, lost in their own world.</p>
                                        <p>“Bing’er, I’ve missed you. Especially these few days, I’ve really really
                                            missed you so much.” Zhou Weiqing lifted his head, looking at the blushing
                                            beauty before him. All of a sudden, he felt as if his mind was blank, having
                                            forgotten why he was even here.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er gave a soft sound of acquiescing, saying softly: “I’ve
                                            missed you too. Little Fatty, you’ve lost so much weight.”</p>
                                        <p><i>I’ve missed you. </i>When Zhou Weiqing heard those words, he felt as if a
                                            gust of wind had blown the luck of the world into his face. Grinning, he
                                            said: “Can I kiss you?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er was taken aback and said quickly: “No.”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s crestfallen look, she looked down and said softly
                                            again: “Not here.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyes lit up, and he snuck closer to her ear and whispered: “I
                                            understand.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er blushed, and hit him on the shoulder: “What do you
                                            understand?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing puffed up his chest, laughing as he said: “Understand means
                                            understand. Come on, let’s go register.” As he said that, he held Shangguan
                                            Bing’er’s hand and started squeezing deeper into the crowd towards their
                                            target. He was tall and strong, and before long they had managed to squeeze
                                            into one of the registration points.</p>
                                        <p>Speaking to the senior year student who was in charge of registration, he
                                            said: “Beautiful lady, we are here to register.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
