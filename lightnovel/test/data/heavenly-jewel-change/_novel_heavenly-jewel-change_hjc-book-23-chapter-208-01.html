                                            “Little Fatty, you must definitely bring me along. Do not worry, I will be
                                            fine. As the saying goes, when one marries a chicken, then one will follow
                                            the chicken. If one marries a dog, then one will follow the dog. I am now
                                            considered a member of the Heavenly Bow Empire, and it is natural that I
                                            play a part as well.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not reject her, nodding as he said: “That is natural, no
                                            matter where I go, I will definitely bring you along.” However in his heart,
                                            he added one more line that he did not speak out loud. <i>As for whether or
                                                not you fight, that is another matter.</i></p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>In about an hour, the upper echelons of the Heavenly Bow Empire had gathered
                                            into the governor’s mansion grand hall.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu was the last to enter the hall, and when Zhou Weiqing saw him, he was
                                            startled. This handsome and suave Fei Li God General was looking extremely
                                            shabby, clearly haggard and exhausted, his attire in disarray and unshaven
                                            face. However, his eyes were lit up, clearer than they had ever been,
                                            showing his spirits were extremely high.</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, why have you called us so urgently? I was in the midst of
                                            reorganizing and incorporating the forces Lady Xiao had brought to us.” As
                                            soon as Ming Yu sat down beside Zhou Weiqing, he asked.</p>
                                        <p>These few days, Zhou Weiqing had thrown off all the responsibilities and had
                                            been leading a relaxed life. However, for Ming Yu, as the First Vice
                                            Commander and overall director of the Heavenly Bow Empire forces, his job
                                            was extremely difficult and onerous. Although the others could help him
                                            share some responsibilities, the absolute trust Zhou Weiqing had in him, as
                                            well as the absolute power in commanding the army was something that Ming Yu
                                            had always wanted. Now that he finally had his chance, he had put his heart,
                                            mind and soul fully into the matter.</p>
                                        <p>In the past, when he was in the Fei Li Empire, although he was considered a
                                            high ranking officer in the army, he just had too many restrictions upon
                                            him. Furthermore, the Fei Li Empire was already a powerhouse Empire, with
                                            its strength already there, and basically their only enemy was the WanShou
                                            Empire in the north. However, the Heavenly Bow Empire was very different. It
                                            could be said that they were starting from scratch, and to a military
                                            specialist and lover like Ming Yu, this was definitely an exciting challenge
                                            to meet. All his life, he had chased after this, and although it was
                                            extremely tiring, ever since he had come here, he had spent everyday leading
                                            a substantial and rich life. Being able to use all the he learned and knew,
                                            it was also a type of happiness.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Bro Ming, you do not need to deal
                                            with everything personally. The most outstanding commanders do not need to
                                            handle every single matter personally, and they can trust in others to
                                            complete their tasks. Look, am I not a perfect example of that?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu couldn’t help but roll his eyes at that, saying: “If everyone does it
                                            like you, then when can we actually conquer the world?”</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Ming Yu said that, the entire meeting hall fell silent, and
                                            everyone looked at him in shock.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu realised that had spoken too much, and he gave an embarrassed
                                            chuckle, saying: “Our achievements are only limited by our daring. At least,
                                            thinking about it is one thing right. Anyway, my dear Supreme Commander,
                                            please hurry up and speak your mind. I still have many things to do.” Ever
                                            since they had recruited two new Regiments of soldiers, besides the position
                                            of Regiment Commander of the Peerless Regiment, Zhou Weiqing had also ‘risen
                                            rank’ to become the Supreme Commander of the current Heavenly Bow Empire
                                            forces. This was a rank that no one could steal from him, and Ming Yu was
                                            still only the Vice Commander.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing swallowed hard before laughing once more, saying: “I have not
                                            misjudged you indeed. You truly have great ambitions! Alright, I will not
                                            waste all your time any longer, let me be direct. The Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace had sent word to invite our Heavenly Bow Empire to send a Battle Team
                                            to join the upcoming Heavenly Jewel Tournament. There is about one and a
                                            half months before the Heavenly Jewel Tournament begins.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing the words Heavenly Jewel Tournament, everyone’s eyes lit up,
                                            especially Lin TianAo, Xiao Yan and Crow, those who had joined the previous
                                            tournament and won the championship. It could be said that the previous
                                            tournament had forged them into what they currently were… not only giving
                                            them the confidence boost they sorely needed, but also giving them the
                                            chance to become one of the stronger powerhouses amongst the younger
                                            generation. It had also given them the honour and glory of a lifetime.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Ming Yu had been rather impatient, but as soon as he heard the
                                            words Heavenly Jewel Tournament, he perked up. “Of course, we definitely
                                            need to join that! Spreading the word… gaining reputation… nothing can beat
                                            having a good ranking in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament! It will greatly
                                            accentuate all our efforts! We must participate indeed. Supreme Commander,
                                            who are you planning to bring?”</p>
                                        <p>The others also nodded rapidly. The Heavenly Jewel Tournament was of great
                                            fame and status in the entire mainland, and could be said to play a decisive
                                            role. It was perhaps second only to the ranking tournaments between the five
                                            Great Saint Lands, but in terms of actual influence, it surpassed even that.
                                            After all, the Heavenly Jewel Tournament was open to all Empires, and even
                                            ordinary citizens could view it… one could just imagine the influence and
                                            reputation it had.</p>
                                        <p>Even Hua Feng, who was normally calm and unflurried, actually looked both
                                            agitated and excited. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, something glittered in his
                                            eyes as he said: “Little Wei, do you know? All these years, your father’s
                                            greatest wish was for our Heavenly Bow Empire to one day have the chance to
                                            participate in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Now, his wish has been
                                            fulfilled by you. Go… you do not have to worry about us here, leave it to
                                            us. Before you return, our Heavenly Bow Empire will never fall to any
                                            enemies.”</p>
                                        <p>The other God Archers of the Heavenly Bow Unit also nodded in unison, their
                                            eyes filled with hope and anticipation as they looked at Zhou Weiqing.
                                            Because of the Shangguan Sisters and their relationship with him, it was
                                            without question that he would not be in danger in the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace, and the current Zhou Weiqing was definitely outstanding amongst the
                                            younger generation, and even his cultivation level had already long caught
                                            up and was above average for his age. With him leading a battle team, the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire could fight against any opponent without any worry, even
                                            if they met an opponent backed by a Great Saint Lands. Furthermore, Zhou
                                            Weiqing was one of the previous champions of the previous Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament. Although that had an element of luck in that victory, it was
                                            without question that the previous experience could only increase his
                                            chances of victory once more.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Since everyone has also agreed, then there
                                            should be no problem. Now, we need to decide who will be joining me in the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament. According to the participation rules, any
                                            participants must be below the age of thirty. Bro Lin and Xiao Yan who
                                            joined me in the previous Tournament are no longer eligible to participate.
                                            Of course, I will be going, but besides myself, I have only confirmed one
                                            other person to join the Heavenly Jewel Tournament- Tian’er. Who else is
                                            willing to go with me?”</p>
                                        <p>Almost as Zhou Weiqing finished speaking, an urgent voice rang out. “Me, me!
                                            Boss, you must bring me this time!”</p>
                                        <p>A massive figure strode to the front, with a toady-ing smile on his face,
                                            that expression was truly a mismatch for his massive, valiant and impressive
                                            figure. It was Ma Qun.</p>
                                        <p>“Stinking little brat, what do you look like now, are you trying to throw
                                            your father’s face?” The Berserker Tribe leader gave his son an exasperated
                                            kick on his ass.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun grinned and said: “Heh heh, Dad, don’t you hope to see me represent
                                            our Berserker Tribe in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament? To show the power of
                                            our Titan bloodline in this greatest stage? Boss, this time, you must
                                            definitely bring me along! Although my cultivation level isn’t too high,
                                            only at the four-Jeweled stage, but wasn’t Crow just at the three-Jeweled
                                            stage when she attended the previous Tournament? My current state is at
                                            least equal or stronger than she was at that time. Bring me along, I will
                                            not throw your face!”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Ma Qun, Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly as he nodded in agreement.
                                            Indeed, though Ma Qun’s cultivation level was not high, only at the
                                            four-Jeweled stage… this fellow was born with a godlike physical strength.
                                            In terms of pure physical strength, he was even above Crow! In the previous
                                            battles, wielding his pair of long spiked maces, his power and destructive
                                            capabilities were perhaps even beyond any ordinary six-Jeweled Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master. Furthermore, his age was definitely suitable. That fellow was
                                            the same age as Zhou Weiqing, and more so, he was the future heir to the
                                            Berserker Tribe. Without question, the Heavenly Jewel Tournament was a great
                                            training ground for any youth, a perfect place where one may forge
                                            themselves in the fires of high level battles. Perhaps, Ma Qun would also be
                                            able to spark his own potential in this tournament.</p>
                                        <p>“Very well, you’re counted as one.” Zhou Weiqing nodded to Ma Qun.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun was overjoyed, jumping up happily. Instantly, *PENG*... This fellow’s
                                            head smashed into the ceiling, causing everyone to burst out laughing.</p>
                                        <p>Crow also took a step forward and said: “Weiqing, count me in as well.”
                                            Currently, Crow’s cultivation level had already reached the five-Jeweled
                                            stage, and her aura and presence was far more stable than previously. Her
                                            age was also eligible, and her overall combat prowess was above Ma Qun’s.
                                            Furthermore, she also had experience from the previous Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament.</p>
                                        <p>“Very good, you were originally part of my plans as well.” Zhou Weiqing
                                            exchanged glances with Crow, and in that instant, their tacit understanding
                                            as teammates in the previous Heavenly Jewel Tournament seemed to return.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued: “The main battle team for the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament needs to be six people, and two reserve members. Currently, we
                                            have four ready to go, so we need at least two more before we can actually
                                            form a battle team. Does anyone else have anybody to recommend? Their
                                            cultivation level must be at least four Jeweled or higher.”</p>
                                        <p>This requirement by Zhou Weiqing, both Yan Zhexi and Kou Rui could barely
                                            reach it. However, neither of them volunteered. The reason was simple; as
                                            compared to the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, both would rather be by Ming Yu’s
                                            side, learning from him. After all, their goal was to be an outstanding
                                            commander and general, not a powerhouse.</p>
                                        <p>All of them exchanged helpless glances, as they all hesitated. Amongst all
                                            present, there were many powerhouses, but there weren’t many who met the
                                            requirement of being below the age of thirty.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a delicate voice suddenly broke the silence. “Weiqing,
                                            bring me back this time. I have left the Heavenly Jewel Island for so long,
                                            and I want to go back to see Master.”</p>
                                        <p>The one who had stepped forward was Little Miss Muddle. Seeing her, Zhou
                                            Weiqing instantly smiled. It could be said that for the success of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s Peerless Regiment had a lot to do with Little Miss Muddle.
                                            Originally, it had only been her and Yun Li as Consolidating Equipment
                                            Masters, and it was their hard work and toil which had given the Peerless
                                            Regiment soldiers so many Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>“Indeed! You had followed me since the previous Heavenly Jewel Tournament,
                                            and it is a good time to return. Right… you still aren’t thirty years old
                                            yet right? Do you want to join us to play around in the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament?”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s beaming smile, those familiar with him all felt as
                                            if they were watching a big bad wolf trying to con and kidnap a little white
                                            rabbit. This Little Miss Muddle’s cultivation level was no lower than
                                            Shangguan Xue’er. Although her combat prowess could not match Shangguan
                                            Xue’er, she still had the Spatial Attribute after all, and with her
                                            cultivation level so high, she could scare off most opponents.</p>
