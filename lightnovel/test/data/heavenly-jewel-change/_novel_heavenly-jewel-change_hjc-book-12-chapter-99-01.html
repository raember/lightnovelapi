                                        <p>Without a slightest bit of hesitation, he half climbed half rolled down the
                                            tree, not daring to stay a second longer at the top of the trees.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, the Lustre Gem inlaid on the Spatial Ring shuddered a
                                            little, and Shangguan Longyin’s deep voice suddenly came from within: “Fei
                                            Li Battle Team Member, Little Four, has retreated from the Lustre Spatial
                                            Realm. The Fei Li Battle Team has lost a member.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started a little at first, before finally reacting. So… this
                                            Lustre Gem could actually be used as a communication tool in the Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm, although it seemed like it was only single-directional, it
                                            was still rather amazing in its own right.</p>
                                        <p>Still, he couldn’t help but feel somewhat gloomy. After all, there were only
                                            thirty two members out of all the Battle Teams, yet the first one to be
                                            eliminated was from their Fei Li Battle Team… that was not a good omen.
                                            Still, Zhou Weiqing could totally guess how Little Four had been
                                            eliminated.</p>
                                        <p>Little Four had the ability to fly, and without question, that fellow had
                                            probably flown up above the treetops, thinking it would be safer there, and
                                            perhaps he had been the one to draw the attention of the huge dragon.
                                            Perhaps that terrifying flame skill which covered more than ten thousand
                                            square metres was even actually targeted at Little Four, with himself being
                                            the innocent victim caught in the crossfire.</p>
                                        <p>Shaking his head helplessly, Zhou Weiqing looked at Fat Cat on his shoulder,
                                            saying: “It looks like we can not enter the air, or even reveal ourselves
                                            then. I’m afraid that the big fellow just now is most likely the strongest
                                            presence in this entire Lustre Spatial Realm. I hope that Little Four
                                            managed to activate the Lustre Gem in time to escape it.</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat said: “Oh? Do I detect a sense of defeat in my indomitable Little
                                            Fatty?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, saying: “Not exactly… It’s just that this place
                                            is just too full of unknown factors, yet also filled with danger all around.
                                            I truly dislike not being in control of the situation.”</p>
                                        <p>Right at that instant, a loud long dragon’s cry rang out from the skies.
                                            Instantly, the entire Lustre Spatial Realm seemed to freeze, still and
                                            silent. Originally, the air was filled with sounds from bugs, birds and
                                            animals all around, but now, in the moment, that all disappeared. The
                                            silence was deafening.</p>
                                        <p>This was the awe inspiring majesty of a high ranked powerhouse…
                                            Dragonfear!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not dare climb up to get a better look at the large dragon
                                            despite his curiosity. He did not want to be the second person to be
                                            eliminated.</p>
                                        <p>Although Fat Cat was much more powerful than himself, even with the two of
                                            them added together, they would barely be able to tickle the dragon.
                                            Together, they would probably be just a tasty snack for it.</p>
                                        <p>As the dragon’s cry echoed through the forest, the intense pressure from
                                            above lasted for a while before slowly disappearing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing let loose a breath he had been subconsciously holding. Turning
                                            to Fat Cat, he asked: “Any ideas on what to do next?”</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat shook her head, saying: “This is also my first time here, how could I
                                            have any concrete ideas? In truth, it will be extremely difficult for your
                                            Fei Li Battle Team to gain a good result. The key will rest upon you and
                                            Little Witch alone.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started: “What about Leader? He is very powerful in his own
                                            right too.”</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat shook her cute little tiger’s head before saying: “Unfortunately, he
                                            will not be able to make it in these circumstances. Previously, I urged you
                                            to bet with him because I could sense his talent and potential especially in
                                            defense, and that he would be a powerful ultimate defense Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master in future. Alas, under the current circumstances, defense alone will
                                            be somewhat useless for surviving in the forest. Unless… He somehow meets up
                                            with either you or Little Witch, which would bring the sum of your powers,
                                            and correspondingly your chances, to a much greater height. Unfortunately,
                                            as you have seen yourself, this Lustre Spatial Realm is extremely large, and
                                            meeting up with one another will be a tall order at least. As such, I
                                            estimate that he will not have a good time. As soon as meets any powerful
                                            opponents, the lack of offense and speed will prove his downfall.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “True enough. We might be having a tough time, but that
                                            doesn’t mean the other three teams will be doing much better right. They
                                            would also be facing similar dangers and problems.”</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat giggled before saying: “You think too much, and also severely
                                            underestimate the Great Saint Lands. Everything else aside, the rest of them
                                            have experienced or at least have knowledge of this Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament Finals before. Just this experience alone eclipses your Fei Li
                                            Battle Team. For example, the members of the other three teams would
                                            definitely know about the existence of that dragon, and would never make the
                                            mistake of flying into the air like Little Four.”</p>
                                        <p>“Alright, enough said. Let’s move along as well as explore the surroundings.
                                            Whatever comes will come, be it good luck or bad luck, we will have to face
                                            it. As dangerous as this Lustre Spatial Realm is, it also has its hidden
                                            gems and treasures that we can gain from.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded. Picking a direction at random, they continued along.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Four hours later.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stopped at a rather large clearing to have a rest and some food.
                                            In the past few hours, they had ran into eight Heavenly Beasts. These
                                            Heavenly Beasts were mostly not very powerful, just at the Shi Stage, but
                                            they had attacked them nonetheless. The strongest ones were at the Zun
                                            Stage, and overall Zhou Weiqing had been able to handle them by himself.</p>
                                        <p>After having a quick simple meal of dry rations, they sat and rested for a
                                            while. Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to continue his explorations, Fat Cat,
                                            still on his shoulder, perked her head up, eyes gleaming as she said softly:
                                            “Someone is coming. Be careful!” As she said that, she leapt into his arms
                                            once more, staying hidden from direct sight.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, she had her own reasons why she hid instead of directly helping
                                            Zhou Weiqing to fight. Currently, Zhou Weiqing was still very far from the
                                            heights of his power, with much room to grow. Undoubtedly, actual combat
                                            would be a great opportunity for him to learn, to grow and to gain
                                            experience. Only when fighting in actual combat could a Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master improve in all areas that just cultivation alone could not provide,
                                            areas like control, usage of Skills etc. As such, unless the situation was
                                            critical, Fat Cat would not easily take action. In her eyes, this Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm could be considered Zhou Weiqing's training grounds.</p>
                                        <p>With Fat Cat’s warning, Zhou Weiqing moved in a flash, dodging behind a large
                                            tree swiftly, gathering his senses while reining in his own energy to
                                            conceal his presence. At the same time, he subtly released the Touch of
                                            Darkness Skill to further boost his senses to the maximum.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he had finished hiding, two figures appeared, silent and swift.
                                            They did not make any noise, nor give out any signs of energy.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing could not see them with his eyes, his Touch of Darkness
                                            enabled him to sense that the two were a male and female respectively. Just
                                            from their movements, Zhou Weiqing was able to tell their origin, as they
                                            were moving along hand-in-hand. Amongst the four Battle Teams, it was
                                            without question that only one of the Battle Teams would have a scene like
                                            that, and that was the BaoPo Battle Team which had the background support of
                                            the Passion Valley.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but be shocked in his heart. Indeed, what Fat Cat
                                            had said was too true, and he could never underestimate the Great Saint
                                            Lands. These BaoPo Battle Team couples could actually join up together, and
                                            with the two of them working together, it would undoubtedly increase their
                                            overall power and safety. Perhaps they had some secret arts that enabled
                                            them to sense each other?</p>
                                        <p>Alas, with all four of the Battle Teams in the Lustre Spatial Realm, it could
                                            be said that they were all opponents, even enemies! <i>What should I do?
                                                Attack? Continue hiding? </i></p>
                                        <p>With Tian’er’s help, he was confident that they would able to take a 2v2
                                            fight with this couple in front of them. Alas, he did not know how much help
                                            she would be willing to give now.</p>
                                        <p>After a short moment of consideration, Zhou Weiqing finally decided to stay
                                            on the side of caution, dispelling the notion of fighting with them.</p>
                                        <p>After all, the finals would last an entire month. If he expended too much
                                            effort on the first day, it would not be beneficial to his overall
                                            strategy.</p>
                                        <p>With that in mind, Zhou Weiqing reinforced his concealment, keeping a tight
                                            hold on his own energy as he waited silently for the BaoPo couple to pass
                                            by.</p>
                                        <p>The two of them walked very slowly; just like what Zhou Weiqing had done
                                            previously, they kept their senses peeled in observation as they moved
                                            along.</p>
                                        <p>Just as they were about 20 yards from the huge tree which Zhou Weiqing was
                                            hiding behind, enroute to pass by, all of a sudden a soft rustling sound
                                            caused the two to halt in their tracks, their gazes snapping towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s hiding spot.</p>
                                        <p>Since the two of them heard the sound, naturally so did Zhou Weiqing. That
                                            was because the rustling sound had been caused by Fat Cat moving around in
                                            his arms. He did not even have time to think why she would do that on
                                            purpose, as he had to instantly react to the incoming danger.</p>
                                        <p>The Overlord Bow coalescing instantly, and at the same time, Zhou Weiqing
                                            jumped backwards in a flash. He did not even need to use his eyes to take
                                            aim, just his enhanced senses alone allowing him to clearly know where the
                                            other pair was. Six arrows flew out almost at the same time, accompanied by
                                            the shrill whistling sound of their flight as the sped towards the man and
                                            woman respectively.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was a person who liked to be in control, and he did not like to
                                            leave his fate in another person’s hands if he had a choice, not even if the
                                            person was Tian’er. As such, as soon as he launched his attack, he retreated
                                            at top speed deeper into the forest. He knew that a complicated terrain like
                                            the forest, and a greater distance between his foes, would be the best way
                                            for him to unleash his full power. As long as he could maintain a distance
                                            of at least a hundred yards from his opponents, even if he met the strongest
                                            powerhouses in the other Battle Teams, he had confidence of fighting with
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>Six reverberating whines followed by six explosions, almost simultaneously,
                                            as the Twisting Bowstring Archery Skill combined with the explosive effect
                                            of the Overlord Bow took effect, the shockwaves from the explosion traveling
                                            almost in a several li radius. The surprising thing was that Zhou Weiqing
                                            could clearly sense that the six arrows had actually all missed their
                                            targets.</p>
                                        <p>The ability in which Zhou Weiqing had the most confidence was not his Demonic
                                            Change State, or his Devour Skill, or even his Legendary Hammers, but his
                                            archery. The torturous years he had spent training in the Heavenly Bow Unit,
                                            coupled with outstanding talent and hard work, had left his archery skill
                                            above even that of his teacher, Mu En. After all, he was a Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master, better able to make full use of the skill that his teacher had
                                            invented and perfected. Not to mention that the distance between his foes
                                            was only several dozen yards, even if it were several hundred yards, he had
                                            the confidence that he would not miss!</p>
                                        <p>Yet, two shadowy figures, with an illusory light, flashed towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing from two different directions at breakneck speeds, boxing him in a
                                            pincer move.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing was already using the full power of his Demonic Right
                                            Leg as well as his Wind Attribute to bring his speed to nearly his maximum
                                            heights, and he was definitely no slouch in that department. However, his
                                            two foes were clearly edging him out in terms of speed, closing the gap
                                            slowly and steadily.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not turn around, but the arrows continued streaming from his
                                            hands, striking out unerringly towards his opponents, as he continuously
                                            changed different archery styles. He had absolute confidence that even if
                                            his opponent was of the six-Jeweled cultivation level, as long as they were
                                            struck by his arrows, it would at the bare minimum slow them down.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, things did not go according to plan. Every arrow that he shot towards
                                            them seemed to be deflected by a strange force as soon as it neared them, or
                                            perhaps the more accurate term would be ‘guided away’, as the arrows seemed
                                            to slide away from them just as they were about to hit. The power of the
                                            Twisting Bowstring Archery Skill and the Overlord Bow could not come to
                                            fruition if the arrows just did not hit!</p>
                                        <p>As the gap closed slowly, they were soon less than twenty yards from Zhou
                                            Weiqing. All of a sudden, the male member of the BaoPo Battle Team suddenly
                                            raised his hands towards Zhou Weiqing in an abrupt motion.</p>
