                                            twist himself around to look. All he saw was Ming Wu speeding forth towards
                                            him, and the suction force was from a huge red flower.</p>
                                        <p>It was a similar Hades’ Flower like Ming Hua’s, but Ming Wu’s one was larger
                                            and much more powerful than hers, more than ten, or even a hundred times!
                                            Zhou Weiqing was just unable to resist that suction force as he was dragged
                                            back unwillingly. In this way, in the next moment, Ming Wu would soon catch
                                            up with him and catch him.</p>
                                        <p>It was at this point that Zhou Weiqing finally used all his power. In mid
                                            air, his left hand slashed towards the back, a ear-splitting tearing sound
                                            accompanying a silver flash - the Spatial Rend.</p>
                                        <p>The Spatial Rend’s effect was without doubt extremely powerful, and with it
                                            blocking, although it did not fully deal with the strong suction power of
                                            the Hades’ Flower, it at least managed to block a large percentage of it,
                                            allowing Zhou Weiqing to regain control. At the same time, he used another
                                            Spatial Skill, Blink, which sent him ten metres away. Since he had reached
                                            the 3-Jeweled cultivation level, his Blink skill had improved from 3 metres
                                            range to 10 metres, and the cooldown had also reduced.</p>
                                        <p>Not only did he unleash those two Skills, while in the midst of Blinking,
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s first Icy Jade Physical Jewel also glowed brilliantly in a
                                            swirl of white icy mist as the Overlord Bow coalesced into his hands.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why he released the Overlord Bow was because Zhou Weiqing knew
                                            that attempting to run was of no use. His only hope was to attempt to stall
                                            Ming Wu with his attacks, in hopes to get an opportunity to escape. As such,
                                            he released both Stored Elemental Skills and Consolidated Physical Jewel
                                            Equipment.</p>
                                        <p>As his right leg lashed out in the air, causing a sharp explosive sound as he
                                            once again charged forth towards the city walls. At the same time, he drew
                                            the Overlord Bow to its maximum, body twisting in midair as he twirled the
                                            Overlord Bow in his hands, the bowstring formed of pure Heavenly Energy
                                            twisting around the titanium alloy arrow he had nocked upon it. With a quick
                                            release, the arrow flew out with a loud swoosh.</p>
                                        <p>The archery skill that Zhou Weiqing had used was Mu En’s specialty skill,
                                            making use of a massive corkscrew spin on the bowstring to greatly increase
                                            the power, and his own unique style of control to release one of the most
                                            powerful archery attacks.</p>
                                        <p>Mu En was after all only a 6-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master, yet he had
                                            managed to use this archery skill to heavily injure a Zong Stage Heavenly
                                            Beast. From that, one could tell how powerful it truly was. Furthermore,
                                            although Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy was currently not comparable to his
                                            teacher’s, his pure physical strength had long since way surpassed Mu En’s.
                                            He was also using the great Overlord Bow, a powerful Consolidated Equipment
                                            that only Strength Heavenly Jewel Masters could use.</p>
                                        <p>An arrow released by such a skill already had a huge destructive power, and
                                            adding the explosive effect of the Overlord Bow to the mix would only cause
                                            an effect of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, more than
                                            several times the destructive capabilities!</p>
                                        <p>One should never forget that Zhou Weiqing was not a close combat type
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master, but an archer! Although his close combat skills were
                                            decent, especially with his Legendary Consolidated Equipment Set Hammers in
                                            hand, he was definitely not as well versed and practiced in using them as
                                            when he had bow in hand, and naturally he was at his best when using
                                            archery.</p>
                                        <p>For Ming Wu to dare to allow Zhou Weiqing to start running first, he
                                            naturally had the confidence to easily catch him. With his cultivation
                                            level, if Zhou Weiqing could reach the city without him doing anything, that
                                            would be a joke.</p>
                                        <p>If the current situation carried on, with the Hades’ Flower strong suction
                                            powers, it would barely be another blink of an eye before Zhou Weiqing would
                                            reach within 30 metres of Ming Wu. Once that happened, Ming Wu was confident
                                            that he could totally subdue Zhou Weiqing without any issues and complete
                                            crush all his hopes of resisting.</p>
                                        <p>However, just when he thought that everything was secured, Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            sudden Spatial Rend gave Ming Wu a surprise. Although he had heard his
                                            daughter’s description of it, it was a totally different matter experiencing
                                            it on his own! Ming Wu was after all a lot more experienced and
                                            knowledgeable than Ming Hua, and he definitely recognized the skill although
                                            she did not.</p>
                                        <p><i>The Silver Emperor’s Spatial Rend! How could this be possible… with that
                                            little brat’s mere cultivation level, how could he possibly Store such a
                                            Skill from the Silver Emperor?! </i>In that instant, Ming Wu was truly
                                            shocked to his core. What was the Silver Emperor? It was a King Stage
                                            Heavenly Beast! To put things in perspective, even with Ming Wu’s power and
                                            cultivation level, should he be a Spatial Heavenly Jewel Master, he would
                                            still likely not be able to Store and Skills from the Silver Emperor!</p>
                                        <p>Heavenly Beasts were similar to Heavenly Jewel Masters when ranking up, and
                                            the gap from Zong Stage to King Stage was immense, not just a huge increase
                                            in quantity of power, but quality as well, and the stage was considered
                                            quite an important breakthrough. From what Ming Wu knew, he had never even
                                            heard of any Heavenly Jewel Master below King Stage being able to Store
                                            Skills from a King Stage Heavenly Beast! That just wasn’t realistic at
                                            all!</p>
                                        <p>Yet, at the same time, Ming Wu was extremely certain that he had not made a
                                            mistake or have his eyes deceived him. The skill that Zhou Weiqing used was
                                            indeed the Spatial Rend of the Silver Emperor! At the same time, he knew
                                            that the Skill Storing Palace had recently captured a Silver Emperor, and it
                                            had paid quite a heavy price in doing so.</p>
                                        <p>Despite the shock and bewilderment in his heart causing his mind to race
                                            wildly, Ming Wu’s actions did not slow at all. Even with the Hades’ Flower
                                            being blocked by the Spatial Rend, with his 9-Jeweled cultivation level, he
                                            was still very confident in taking down Zhou Weiqing before he could
                                            escape.</p>
                                        <p>Just at that moment, Zhou Weiqing’s Overlord Bow fired out the arrow, and
                                            once again Ming Wu was given a nasty shock at the power of the arrow
                                            speeding towards him. Judging by its power, he dared not let it strike him,
                                            as it would definitely deal some damage to him.</p>
                                        <p>With his body in mid air, Ming Wu made a guarding motion with his right hand,
                                            using his fingers to strike out at the arrow at the precise time. At the
                                            same time, a white light erupted out from his hands on the point of impact,
                                            forcefully covering the massive explosion and shielding it from him.</p>
                                        <p>Without a doubt, even with Zhou Weiqing’s amazing archery and his
                                            Consolidated Equipment Overlord Bow, Zhou Weiqing was still unable to
                                            threaten Ming Wu. However, a something strange occurred - Ming Wu’s body
                                            froze in mid air. Although his body was still carried forward by inertia,
                                            but his speed was like a snail’s pace as compared to his previous
                                            motion.</p>
                                        <p><i>How could this be?!</i> Ming Wu’s face changed for the first time, shock,
                                            disbelief and even a hint of fear displaying out. Although he had been
                                            surprised several times by Zhou Weiqing earlier, nothing had such an effect
                                            on him as this. After all, when Ming Wu had dealt with the blow earlier, he
                                            had made use of his Heavenly Xu Energy to dissolve the power held within the
                                            arrow. Yet, when it exploded, his speed had shockingly still been affected,
                                            causing him to slow drastically. Furthermore, he was now circulating all his
                                            Heavenly Energy, even manipulating the Life Attribute of his Elemental
                                            Jewels, and yet he was still unable to resolve this slowing effect… which
                                            lasted a whole three seconds.</p>
                                        <p>Three seconds might seem a short period of time, but sometimes it might just
                                            seem an extremely long time. Now, in the heat of combat, it was such a time
                                            indeed.</p>
                                        <p>However, after shooting the arrow, Zhou Weiqing did not even look at Ming Wu,
                                            not hesitating a bit to see the effect. Instead, he had already spun around,
                                            right foot slamming hard on the city walls. Once again, his body flew up
                                            into the air, and in the short span of the three seconds, he had already
                                            swiftly leapt up onto the top of the world like a gust of wind. As he did
                                            so, he even waved towards Ming Wu before jumping down into the city. At the
                                            same time, he also cried out loudly in a weird sound, drawing attention and
                                            causing a commotion amongst the city guards. Without question, he was trying
                                            to create a large commotion in order to aid his escape.</p>
                                        <p>As the three seconds ended, a moment later, Ming Wu was already in the Fei Li
                                            City. Currently, the expression on his face was very ugly. Up until now, he
                                            still had not figured out what skill Zhou Weiqing had used to be able to
                                            slow him down for three seconds. With the huge disparity between the two of
                                            their cultivation levels, this was originally not something that was
                                            possible.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing entered the Fei Li City, he immediately ran for his
                                            life. His heart was still pounding away in fear, and his only thought now
                                            was to take Shangguan Bing’er and get out of Fei Li City immediately. Even
                                            though his studies were important, and so were the students he had planned
                                            to recruit from the Fei Li Military Academy, nothing was more important to
                                            him than his own freedom. Furthermore, it might be even death he faced.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, Zhou Weiqing stopped in his tracks. In front of him, a
                                            shadowy figure stood illuminated by the moonlight - it was Ming Wu.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Ming Wu was standing there, his arms crossed and brow furrowed.
                                            His gaze seemed to flicker around, as if struggling with something.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood in surprise for a moment, before he finally forced a smile
                                            on his face… “Senior, I never expected to meet you again so quickly. Do not
                                            worry Senior, although I am young and my cultivation level is way below
                                            yours, but I definitely am a man of my word. I will never reveal anything
                                            about the Heavenly Demon Sect to anyone else. To keep my promise is what a
                                            man has to do…”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Wu sighed and said: “Enough. You do not need to try and wrangle anything
                                            out of me. I admit that you have really given me many big surprises today,
                                            and I have lost the previous bet. I had truly never expected you to not just
                                            have the Silver Emperor’s Spatial Rend, but also that unknown powerful
                                            control skill! If I’m not wrong, your attributes are Wind, Spatial and
                                            Demonic… at least three attributes!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “It’s getting late, senior. Since our bet has ended, then
                                            this junior will return home to sleep.” As he said that, he turned and
                                            quickly walked away.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, in a quick flash, Ming Wu stood in front of him once more, the
                                            expression on his face extremely ugly. With a sigh, he said: “I’m very
                                            sorry, young man. I’m afraid that I have to break my word for once. For the
                                            sake of the Sect’s future, my own personal honour is nothing, and I am
                                            willing to bear the name of being perfidy. Alas, no matter what, I need you
                                            to join our Heavenly Demon Sect today. You are just too talented, and your
                                            talent alone gives me the chills. I believe that if you join our Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect, in the future, you will bring our Sect to rise up in glory.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyes widened as he stared at Ming Wu, dumfounded… the
                                            situation before his eyes was definitely not what he expected.</p>
                                        <p>For a Upper Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master like Ming Wu, with his
                                            status in the Heavenly Jewel Master World, he had actually gone back on his
                                            word!</p>
                                        <p>Bearing the name of perfidy might sound easy, but for a Upper Level Zong
                                            Stage Heavenly Jewel Master to say that, how difficult could it be? At this
                                            point, Zhou Weiqing’s heart sank like a rock. Now that Ming Wu had thrown
                                            his honour away for the sake of his Sect, Zhou Weiqing was at a loss of what
                                            to do.</p>
                                        <p></p>
