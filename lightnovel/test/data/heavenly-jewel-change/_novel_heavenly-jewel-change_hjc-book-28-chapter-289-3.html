                                            extremely small. Even a Heavenly God would not be able to detect it, unless
                                            he was deliberately paying attention to it. </p>
                                        <p>Before, Zhou Weiqing intentionally fell behind the other leaders to mislead
                                            them into thinking that he was much weaker than he actually was, and that it
                                            was impossible for him to overtake them. Thus, they did not take any notice
                                            of him. Zhou Weiqing waited till they were fighting against each other at
                                            the front before he used Spatial Travel to get ahead of them.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had made use of the four leaders' psychological inertia to his
                                            advantage. Before the establishment of the Peerless Sect as a Saint Land,
                                            none of the leaders of the Saint Lands had specialized in the Spatial
                                            Attribute, let alone grasping Spatial Law. </p>
                                        <p>The first thing that came to all their minds when they saw Zhou Weiqing
                                            playing with the five stones in mid-air was: How is this possible?</p>
                                        <p>However, the truth was right before their eyes - regardless of how Zhou
                                            Weiqing did it, he was indeed in possession of all five stones. According to
                                            the rules of the Grand Tournament, they were not allowed to launch any
                                            direct attacks during the drawing of lots. Hence, they were unable to snatch
                                            the stones from him.</p>
                                        <p>When the leaders of the four Saint Lands were dumbstruck, Zhou Weiqing waved
                                            his right hand and shouted, “This is for you, catch it properly.” Four rays
                                            of light shot out at the same time towards the four leaders’ location.</p>
                                        <p>Based on Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base, the distance was not considered
                                            far. Before the act of waving his hand was completed, the four stones had
                                            already appeared before Xue AoTian, Shangguan Tianyang, etc. Instinctively,
                                            the four leaders raised their hands and each of them caught a stone.</p>
                                        <p>Upon looking at the stone in their hands, Passion Valley's Huang Xingyun
                                            almost collapsed in anger. The red stone is in his hand, which meant that
                                            Passion Valley was the first to enter the first round. Fen Tian was not any
                                            better - he had caught the orange stone. That was to say that the first
                                            battle was to be held between the Blood Red Hell and the Passion
                                            Valley. </p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian had caught the yellow stone, hence the Heavenly Snow Mountain was
                                            the third to enter. Shangguan Tianyang, who was all smiles, had caught the
                                            green stone. He nodded his head towards Zhou Weiqing who was in mid-air,
                                            expressing his satisfaction. He had a sudden realization that his bratty
                                            son-in-law who had snatched his three nieces was actually not as hateful as
                                            before. </p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian looked rather calm, as though he had already anticipated Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s actions.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing had his intentions for doing so. In his eyes, the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace were equally on
                                            intimate terms with him. It did not matter who was placed last. However, the
                                            representative of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was only a Heavenly King - it
                                            would not bode well for them if he were to go first. According to the rules,
                                            the Saint Land that lost its first participant had to send in its second one
                                            to wait in the battle line. Hence, the longer one stayed on, the better.</p>
                                        <p>With a mischievous smile on his face, Zhou Weiqing had descended to the
                                            ground. He held onto the blue stone that meant that the Peerless Sect was
                                            the last to enter. From the look on his face, he looked as contented as he
                                            could be. He had absolutely no intention to hide the emotions in his
                                            heart. </p>
                                        <p>Earlier, when the Peerless Sect had just arrived at the venue, most of the
                                            people were looking down on them. After Ling Dang had finished off the Blood
                                            Red Hell's powerhouse, coupled with Zhou Weiqing's performance during the
                                            drawing of lots, nobody present dared to look down on them anymore. After
                                            all, the Peerless Sect had already taken in the remaining members of the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect. Not to forget, they also had the Six Ultimate Heavenly
                                            Emperor on their side, together with Ling Dang, whose cultivation base was
                                            still unknown. Most importantly, they could not tell what Zhou Weiqing's
                                            cultivation base was as well.</p>
                                        <p>After the rest of the leaders had descended to the ground, their respective
                                            subordinates had gave them a detailed explanation of how Zhou Weiqing
                                            managed to get hold of the stones earlier. Since all of them were one of the
                                            top powerhouses in the world, they naturally could tell that Zhou Weiqing
                                            had grasped the Spatial Law. It was an ability that only a Heavenly God
                                            powerhouse could master, under normal circumstances! However, Zhou Weiqing
                                            was still very young. Could he actually have made a breakthrough to the
                                            Heavenly God Stage? </p>
                                        <p>Everyone felt that it was impossible, including Xue AoTian and Shangguan
                                            Tianyang. However, even if he was not a Heavenly God, he was still a
                                            difficult opponent just by virtue of the fact that he had grasped the
                                            Spatial Law.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian said in a deep voice, “Since the drawing of lots is over, let us
                                            begin according to the order that had been decided upon.”</p>
                                        <p>The average age of the powerhouses present at the Grand Tournament of Saint
                                            Lands was more than 70 years old. Furthermore, everyone was very familiar
                                            with the rules of the Grand Tournament, hence there was no need for anyone
                                            to oversee the battles. </p>
                                        <p>The tall and thin powerhouse of the Blood Red Hell and Yun Ruoyu of the
                                            Passion Valley slowly walked out towards the center of the arena.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing walked back to the Peerless Sect with a huge smile on his face.
                                            Long Shiya chuckled as he looked at his precious disciple, and Little Witch
                                            gave Zhou Weiqing a thumbs up. However, the rest of the four women did not
                                            look that happy. Shangguan Bing’er had a rather neutral look on her face
                                            compared to the three Shangguan sisters - they looked somewhat angry and had
                                            ignored his presence entirely. </p>
                                        <p>At this time, the battle in the arena had began. The two figures soared up
                                            into the sky at the same time, like two arrows shooting into the air.
                                            Everyone looked up accordingly.</p>
                                        <p>All the previous Grand Tournaments were held in the air. This was also the
                                            reason why all the powerhouses that took part in the tournament were at
                                            least of the Heavenly King Stage. If the battles were held on the ground,
                                            based on their destructive power, the amount of damage and destruction
                                            caused would be too great. Hence, it was safer for the battles to be held in
                                            the air. Even so, they could only fight at the altitude of at least a
                                            thousand meters. </p>
                                        <p>Even a Heavenly King powerhouse was not able to see what was going on in the
                                            air, at the altitude of a thousand meters, from the ground. After about a
                                            few blinks of an eye, sounds strong violent auras clashing could be heard
                                            from the sky. Loud rumbling sounds were heard. Every single time a sound was
                                            heard, the earth seemed to tremble accordingly.</p>
                                        <p>Terrifying energy ripples continuously fluctuated in the air.</p>
                                        <p>Although a Heavenly King might not be able to see what was going on clearly,
                                            it did not mean that a Heavenly Emperor could not. The weather today was
                                            exceptionally good. Zhou Weiqing lifted his head up and saw an evenly
                                            matched battle. </p>
                                        <p>Indeed, it was evenly matched. Yun Ruoyu was one of the two Valley Masters of
                                            the Passion Valley. Undoubtedly, she was powerful. Her opponent was equally
                                            powerful as well. The Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor had been using his
                                            Destruction Attribute without holding back, the moment the battle had
                                            started.</p>
                                        <p>Without the Destruction Attribute, his cultivation base could not be compared
                                            to the Max Level Heavenly Emperor, Yun Ruoyu. However, the moment he engaged
                                            in his Destruction Attribute, it had immediately neutralized the upper hand
                                            that Yun Ruoyu had previously secured with her Time Attribute. After a
                                            series of blows exchanged, from the looks of it, Yun Ruoyu had slowly
                                            started to fall behind. The dense Destruction Attribute within the air had
                                            made it strenuous for this Valley Master to withstand. She was clearly at a
                                            huge disadvantage. </p>
                                        <p>Looking at the battle that was ongoing in the sky, Fen Tian looked extremely
                                            proud. On the other hand, Xue AoTian still had the same expression on his
                                            face, seemingly unaffected by what was going on. However, the Passion
                                            Valley’s Huang Xingyun looked extremely worried. The strongest powerhouses
                                            of the Passion Valley were the pair of husband and wife, Huang Xingyun and
                                            Yun Ruoyu. If Yun Ruoyu could not last through the first round, he would
                                            have to immediately send in the second participant to wait behind the battle
                                            line. In that way, it was disadvantageous to the Passion Valley. Moreover,
                                            the might displayed by the Blood Red Hell had shocked everyone.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang’s facial expression was the best proof - he looked
                                            extremely grave. It was undoubtedly genuine. He knew the Blood Red Hell very
                                            well, but he had never seen the man that Fen Tian had sent out. The power of
                                            this Heavenly Emperor had far exceeded his expectations. Even though
                                            Shangguan Tianyang was confident of winning, if Fen Tian had more
                                            powerhouses of the level as that man, it was uncertain if the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace could still maintain its position as the number one Saint
                                            Land in the Mainland. </p>
                                        <p>Without a doubt, the Heavenly Jewel masters that were able to participate in
                                            the Grand Tournament were in possession of at least eight pieces of their
                                            respective Legendary Set. It was also the case for the two powerhouses that
                                            were currently in the air - they were equipped with nine pieces. </p>
                                        <p>“I admit defeat,” said Yun Ruoyu reluctantly. Immediately after, the two
                                            figures descended onto the ground.</p>
                                        <p>In the Grand Tournament, once the battles had started, they would only end
                                            when one party was dead, unless either one of them had chosen to
                                            surrender.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Ruoyu looked rather battered up - there were at least ten black battle
                                            marks on her Legendary Set that were left behind by the Destruction
                                            Attribute. Even her hair was in a mess. She was gasping for air and she
                                            looked very pale. </p>
                                        <p>The tall and thin Blood Red Hell powerhouse looked arrogant. He placed both
                                            hands behind his back and did not make a single sound. From the looks of it,
                                            he seemed to despise the Passion Valley. </p>
                                        <p>Fen Tian laughed out loud and said to Huang Xingyun, “Valley Master Huang, it
                                            seems like it's impossible for the Passion Valley the be ranked above the
                                            Blood Red Hell.”</p>
                                        <p>Huang Xingyu snorted coldly, “The tournament had just begun, it’s too early
                                            for you to say that.”</p>
                                        <p>As he spoke, he waved his hand. A Heavenly Emperor behind him emerged and
                                            joined the battle line.</p>
                                        <p>According to the order based on the lots drawn, the next to enter the arena
                                            was the representative of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, the Tiger King Xue
                                            AoYing. There were no breaks in between each battle in the Grand Tournament.
                                            Otherwise, it would give a strong powerhouse ample rest to last till the
                                            end. </p>
                                        <p>The continuous battle style could at least weaken the strong powerhouses with
                                            a high cultivation base.</p>
                                        <p>“After you,” shouted Xue AoYing. A series of intense white light erupted from
                                            his body. Within the white light, there were also a dozen of black patterns.
                                            Coupled with his thunderous roar, it seemed as though he had transformed
                                            into an enormous tiger, soaring into the sky.</p>
                                        <p>Similarly, the Blood Red Hell elder soared into the sky once again. In a
                                            blink of an eye, he had risen to an altitude of a thousand meters once
                                            more.</p>
                                        <p>The atmosphere within the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain had become a lot
                                            more tense the moment the Grand Tournament had officially commenced. The
                                            rhythm of the battle was extremely fast, and the participants of the
                                            tournament were very strong. In the first two battles, the participants were
                                            all Heavenly Emperors. Every single Saint Land wanted to gain the upper hand
                                            by suppressing each other with power. Hence, they sent out strong
                                            powerhouses to represent themselves, just that the leaders of the Saint
                                            Lands had no intention to take part in the battles yet. </p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Emperor of the Blood Red Hell was wearing a dark red armor. He
                                            had no weapons, but his armor had fully covered his entire body. As his body
                                            flashed, it stirred up a series of blood red images in the sky. </p>
                                        <p>The Legendary Set that the Tiger King Xue AoYing was equipped with was a lot
                                            more dazzling and beautiful. A snowy white armor had fully covered his
                                            entire body. On top of the snowy white were streaks of dark blue patterns.
                                            There was the head of a tiger on both his shoulders as well. He was holding
                                            a weapon in both hands, the two tiger palms appeared to be exceptionally
                                            huge. Indistinctly, the air surrounding the tiger palms shown traces of
                                            being torn apart. </p>
                                        <p>As the younger blood brother of the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian,
                                            one could well imagine how powerful Xue AoYing was. Furthermore, the combat
                                            experiences of the Wan Shou Empire powerhouses were cultivated from a young
                                            age. The moment both powerhouses had soared up to the required altitude, the
                                            Tiger King had launched an attack immediately without any hesitation. </p>
