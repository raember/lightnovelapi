                                            suddenly sensed a terrifying Heavenly Energy pressure from behind.</p>
                                        <p>As such, she had turned back stealthily, seeing Zhou Weiqing who had remained
                                            behind, as well as the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and his
                                            friend Duan Tianlang.</p>
                                        <p>Towards Duan Tianlang, she was unable to read into him. However, when Long
                                            Shiya started healing Duan Tianlang and dragging him back from verge of
                                            death, the sheer power he unleashed caused her to be in shock. She had never
                                            expected that such a powerhouse would be at Zhou Weiqing’s side. She could
                                            clearly tell that this fat middle aged man was at the same level as her
                                            father and big uncle… that was a Heavenly Emperor! Such a powerhouse… even
                                            in the entire Boundless Mainland, one could count the total number with
                                            their two hands. Seeing the respect Zhou Weiqing had for the fat man, it was
                                            clear their relationship was not simple.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er immediately decided that she would have to ask her sister
                                            about this, as Fei’er would likely know who that was.</p>
                                        <p>As such, after the travel, she had sneaked into the army camp. Who knew that
                                            before she could even find Fei’er and ask her about Long Shiya, she instead
                                            saw Zhou Weiqing and her sister being intimate, hearing the conversation
                                            between the two. The worst fear of Shangguan Xue’er’s had been realised
                                            indeed.</p>
                                        <p>Looking on at them, she couldn’t help but blush deeply as her heart raced,
                                            and she immediately gave a cold humph. At that moment, she suddenly felt a
                                            terrifying aura in the area, and she did not hesitate to flee the army camp
                                            immediately. That was the reason why Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er did
                                            not discover her.</p>
                                        <p>Where that pressure had come from, Shangguan Fei’er did not know. She had
                                            been using the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s secret arts to barely hide her
                                            presence, but she knew that if she continued staying there, the Heavenly
                                            Emperor powerhouse would definitely be able to detect her. Although she was
                                            confident in her own abilities, when it came to the level of Heavenly
                                            Emperor, she would not have the slightest chance.</p>
                                        <p><i>What do I do? </i>All of a sudden, Shangguan Xue’er felt at a loss. She
                                            was getting a headache from the relationship between Zhou Weiqing and her
                                            sisters. However, she could understand Fei’er’s feelings… for Zhou Weiqing
                                            to be able to depend on his own strength to develop and grow in the northern
                                            border to such a degree, with his own personal strength, he definitely had
                                            something that attracted her sister. Otherwise, with Shangguan Fei’er’s
                                            character, how could she possibly let him take advantage of her so easily.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><i>This will not do… no matter what, I have to bring Second Sis back. This
                                            Zhou Little Fatty is Third Sis’ man… how can I allow him and Second Sis to
                                            have intimate relations?</i></p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er immediately set her resolve inwardly. However, she knew that
                                            she would not be able to continuously sneak in so easily, as that Heavenly
                                            Emperor powerhouse would eventually sense her. As such, she could only
                                            depend on regular channels to meet up with Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan
                                            Fei’er. <i>Hmph, Zhou Weiqing, you rotten egg! Having one of my sisters
                                                isn’t enough for you, you dare to provoke my second sis as well! Also…
                                                there is still that little tigress of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, there
                                                is clearly something between them as well. This time, if you do not give
                                                an accounting, I will not let you go so easily. </i></p>
                                        <p>Lost in her thoughts, Shangguan Fei’er subconsciously gripped her fists
                                            tightly, her heart filled with anger and detest for Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not know how much wine he had drank; all he remembered was
                                            many of his soldiers coming to toast him. By the time he woke up in the
                                            morning from the drunken stupor, the sun had already long risen and light
                                            had already flooded the tent, the comfortable warmth leaving him in a lazy
                                            languor.</p>
                                        <p>Hangovers were undoubtedly a painful experience for ordinary people, but for
                                            powerhouses like Zhou Weiqing, it was nothing. His physique was far beyond
                                            any ordinary person, and alcohol would not have any harmful effects on
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>Stretching lazily, Zhou Weiqing clambered off his bed. Although he did not
                                            succeed in being intimate with Shangguan Fei’er last night, the drink was
                                            still extremely comfortable. Shouting and cheering together with his men,
                                            that was indeed an enjoyable feeling.</p>
                                        <p>“Report! Battalion Commander, are you awake yet?” An urgent voice abruptly
                                            came from outside his tent.</p>
                                        <p>“En? Come in.” Zhou Weiqing said questioningly.</p>
                                        <p>The tent flap raised, and one of the Peerless Battalion soldiers entered.
                                            “Battalion Commander, please hurry, something happened… Green Wolf is
                                            dying.”</p>
                                        <p>“What did you say?!” Only then did the lazy satisfied feeling that Zhou
                                            Weiqing was in evaporated. “What happened?!”</p>
                                        <p>The soldier replied: “It’s the other Regiment soldiers. This morning, nobody
                                            knows why but the Sixteenth Regiment Regiment Commander Shen Bu personally
                                            led men over here… After that, a fight broke out, and Green Wolf was beaten
                                            up by two of the enemy Battalion Commanders working together… it looks like
                                            he won’t last long. The brothers are all angry, and we are at a standoff
                                            with the Sixteenth Regiment men.”</p>
                                        <p>“HMPH! They’re asking for death!” Zhou Weiqing howled in rage, charging out
                                            of the tent in a flash. He had spent so much time, effort and money in
                                            cultivating these Peerless Battalion warriors, and now that they had a
                                            modicum of success and were on the right path, such a thing had happened.
                                            Green Wolf had reached the Seven-Jeweled cultivation level, and amongst
                                            their Physical Jewel Masters, he was one of the top few. Even amongst all
                                            the Company Leaders, he was around the top few of the ranking.</p>
                                        <p>At time, Zhou Weiqing could be very generous, but there were some areas where
                                            he was definitely extremely stingy. In his eyes, each and every single
                                            person in the Peerless Battalion was extremely important to him, his
                                            brothers, and also his greatest hope for reviving his Heavenly Bow Empire.
                                            His protective instinct towards them was extremely strong, and hearing that
                                            one of his brothers had almost been killed, how could he not be anxious?</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not even need to ask for directions, instantly sensing where
                                            there was a large gathering of people as he dashed towards that area. As he
                                            had expected, besides those Peerless Battalion soldiers who were still
                                            sleeping from the drinking last night, there were at least five hundred men
                                            gathered there, the tension in the atmosphere clear as both sides seemed
                                            ready to fight; Zhou Weiqing could sense that much even from such a
                                            distance.</p>
                                        <p>“What’s going on? Let me pass.” Zhou Weiqing shouted out loud, instantly
                                            drawing the gazes from all those present. Immediately, the group parted,
                                            allowing him a passageway through.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing strode quickly through the ranks, reaching the front in a
                                            blink.</p>
                                        <p>At that moment, the sentiments of the Peerless Battalion soldiers were all
                                            roused up in anger, indignation, sheer rage… As soon as they saw Zhou
                                            Weiqing, an uproar rose up as they all started talking at once.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander, you must help us get an accounting for this! Those
                                            Sixteenth Regiment fellows beat up many of our brothers just because they
                                            outnumbered them.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes! Battalion Commander, give the order! Let’s kill all these
                                            bastards!”</p>
                                        <p>These soldiers of the Peerless Battalion were after all originally ruffians
                                            and rogues, and fighting and creating disturbances was one of the most
                                            common things they did to be sent to the Ruffian Battalion. Just because
                                            their opponent’s Regiment Commander had come didn’t mean they would be
                                            afraid or step back… if not for Wei Feng and the other Company Leaders
                                            holding them back, perhaps they would have swarmed over the Sixteenth
                                            Regiment men by now.</p>
                                        <p>“Everyone shut up! I will get an accounting for us all!” Zhou Weiqing yelled
                                            angrily.</p>
                                        <p>Instantly, the soldiers of the Peerless Battalion fell into silence. In the
                                            entire Peerless Battalion, Zhou Weiqing had absolute authority. Not just
                                            because of the various ‘profit’ he brought to them, or the respect and love
                                            they had for him, but also because of his own sheer personal strength. In
                                            the battlefield, he was always in the thick of the fight, fighting the
                                            strongest of the enemies. Although the Peerless Battalion soldiers might not
                                            have the best characters, they were all truly respectful and held much
                                            admiration for this young Battalion Commander of theirs.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing moved to the front, and Wei Feng immediately stepped forward to
                                            receive him. He breathed a sigh of relief on seeing Zhou Weiqing, and said:
                                            “Battalion Commander, you are finally here. If you had not come soon, things
                                            would have gone out of hand.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said solemnly: “Vice Commander Wei, what is going on?” He turned
                                            to look at the Peerless Battalion soldiers, who still had the stink of
                                            alcohol about them, but each and every one of them were enraged. Most of
                                            them had their weapons out, looking as if they would attack at any moment if
                                            they did not get an answer.</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, Shen Bu’s expression was extremely unfriendly as well.
                                            Behind her, all ten of the Battalion Commanders from the Sixteenth Regiment
                                            were here as well, the feathers in their caps showing their identity. Behind
                                            them, there were at least five hundred men, likely Shen Bu’s personal guards
                                            and the elites of the Sixteenth Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng stepped closer to Zhou Weiqing’s side and said in a low tone that
                                            only he could hear. “Last night, we threw the rubbish back to the Sixteenth
                                            Regiment, and when they discovered in this morning, they came looking for
                                            trouble. At first, it was just those Heavy Cavalry soldiers who we took care
                                            off last time, and when after some heated words were exchanged, a fight
                                            broke out. Our brothers followed your orders; since others have come to our
                                            territory, they beat them up… and most of them were injured. Still, they
                                            still kept their reason about them and held back, and there should be no
                                            heavy injuries. After that, some of their Battalion Commanders brought men
                                            over to continue looking for trouble. Most of our brothers were still semi
                                            drunk from the night before, and once again a fight broke out. By the time I
                                            arrived, it was too late, and Green Wolf was already severely injured. I’m
                                            afraid…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glanced to the side and saw Green Wolf, who lay there on the
                                            verge of death, barely gasping for breath from the caved in chest, blood
                                            welling out from all around the chest area.</p>
                                        <p>As that picture entered his sight, Zhou Weiqing felt a rush of hot blood
                                            gushing to his brain, and his breathing growing heavy with rage.</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou Weiqing, you better give me an accounting today, otherwise we will
                                            bring it up to the military court.” As soon as Shen Bu saw that Zhou Weiqing
                                            had arrived, she immediately yelled at him in a rage.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng’s words had been simple, but in truth, two entire Companies of Heavy
                                            Calvary soldiers had come from the Sixteenth Regiment earlier. Although they
                                            were not fully geared, they still thought highly of themselves and their
                                            fighting capabilities, and came looking for trouble just like that. Of
                                            course, they had not expected that all these Peerless Battalion soldiers had
                                            been drilled for months by Shangguan Fei’er, and as the two sides clashed,
                                            it was definitely not them who suffered the disadvantage.</p>
                                        <p>Two entire Companies of Heavy Cavalry soldiers were all beaten back, with
                                            more than a third suffering from broken bones or fractures. Since when had
                                            the Sixteenth Regiment taken such a loss, and the Battalion Commanders sent
                                            word to Shen Bu before rushing down with their men. However, they had not
                                            taken the advantage at the same time, as the ruffians of the Peerless
                                            Battalion were just too savage… when they fought, it was as if they did not
                                            care for their lives. Although Green Wolf was mortally wounded, he had also
                                            broken both arms of the two Battalion Commanders he had been fighting. If
                                            not for the fact that the other Company Leaders of the Peerless Battalion
                                            had not come in time, perhaps the outcome of the fight would be very
                                            different.</p>
                                        <p>It had been the simultaneous arrival of Shen Bu and Wei Feng that had finally
                                            caused the fighting to halt and the situation to stabilize relatively into
                                            the current stalemate.</p>
