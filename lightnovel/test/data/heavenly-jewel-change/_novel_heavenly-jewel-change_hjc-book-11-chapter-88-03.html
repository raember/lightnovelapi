                                        <p>“Hmph, no good deed goes unpunished. Fine, I’ll leave then. If you want to
                                            help him, it isn’t difficult. Slowly infuse some Heavenly Energy through his
                                            palms. Zhou Weiqing, I know you can hear me, when they do so, try to use
                                            your spiritual energy to activate your Devour Skill, and draw the Heavenly
                                            Energy into your body to heal yourself.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, Little Witch made a face at them before turning to
                                            leave.</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao said: “Can her words be trusted?”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo said solemnly: “Previously, when she came to look for Weiqing, she
                                            did not seem to have any enmity towards him. We can try it out, but be very
                                            careful, only a little at a time. Let me try.”</p>
                                        <p>Xiao Yan and Drunken Bao each lifted and supported one of Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            arms, and Lin TianAo placed both palms onto Zhou Weiqing’s, carefully
                                            circulating his Heavenly Energy to move into the palms slowly.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing had heard Little Witch’s words. Although he could not
                                            move his body, he could still listen and think. He did not know if what she
                                            said would really help him, but he decided to give it a try anyway.</p>
                                        <p>What followed next proved that Little Witch was indeed not lying to them. At
                                            first, Zhou Weiqing did not feel anything, but as Lin TianAo slowly infused
                                            his Heavenly Energy into his palms, he felt his arms slowly regaining a
                                            little bit of feeling. Soon after, he was able to activate the Devour
                                            Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo felt two weak suction forces pulling from Zhou Weiqing’s palms,
                                            drawing in his Heavenly Energy. At this point, Zhou Weiqing was just too
                                            weak, and the suction force was extremely weak.</p>
                                        <p>As he continued Devouring, Lin TianAo’s Heavenly Energy began to circulate
                                            upwards through his arms and to his shoulders, soon reaching the clavicle
                                            Acupuncture Point and amazingly it seemed to ignite the Death Acupuncture
                                            Point. A slow whirlpool formed once again, and only then did Zhou Weiqing
                                            realise that he had been so drained and weak that all  his energy whirlpools
                                            around his Death Acupuncture Points had stopped moving.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Little Witch did not know about Zhou Weiqing’s Immortal Deity
                                            Technique or its intricacies, but regarding the profound mysteries of the
                                            Devour Skill, no one could no better than the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p>
                                        <p>As the Heavenly Energy circulated around his body, reactivating his energy
                                            whirlpools and reinvigorating his body, feeling slowly returned to him. By
                                            the time his last Death Acupuncture Point had been re- broken through and
                                            resumed the spinning of its energy whirlpool, Zhou Weiqing was finally able
                                            to speak.</p>
                                        <p>“Ahhhh, it hurts!” Zhou Weiqing exclaimed out loud. He was almost regretting
                                            getting Lin TianAo to infuse Heavenly Energy to recover, as the sheer pain
                                            caused him to almost faint. At that point, he almost wished for the numbness
                                            to return.</p>
                                        <p>As his Death Acupuncture Points resumed their energy whirlpools, it also
                                            allowed him to really examine his body’s situation. ‘Terrible’ was barely
                                            scratching the surface of its description now.</p>
                                        <p>Not just his body and muscles, his entire meridian system had at least thirty
                                            percent totally shattered, while the remaining seventy percent were split
                                            and damaged. It was no wonder that Shangguan Longyin had said he was drained
                                            of vitality.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was certain that if not for the fact that he had gone through
                                            his second evolving, he would likely have self imploded from attempting to
                                            unleash the Dark Demon God Lightning, and not having any chance of
                                            success.</p>
                                        <p>When he was unleashing the Dark Demon God Lightning, using his right foot
                                            hook like that was not an attempt to look ‘cool’, but because he had no
                                            choice but to do so. That was because out of his entire body, even in the
                                            Demonic Change state, his Demonic Right Leg was the toughest and most
                                            resilient.</p>
                                        <p>At first, Zhou Weiqing had not thought about that, but when he had started
                                            unleashing the Dark Demon God Lightning, he had realised at the last moment
                                            that he was in trouble. The terrifying Skill had drained off every last bit
                                            of his Heavenly Energy, as if he had become a piece dried beef jerky. That
                                            wasn’t even sufficient, and added to it, that huge mass of energy was moving
                                            about his body uncontrollably. Zhou Weiqing had to force it into his right
                                            leg before he could finally gain some semblance over it to properly unleash
                                            it.</p>
                                        <p>The Dark Demon God Lightning was just too terrifying; not only did it destroy
                                            the enemy, it also inflicted serious injuries on himself. Although the
                                            three-Jeweled level Dark Demon God Lightning was far from its peak, with
                                            much room to grow, but it had already done so much damage to himself. One
                                            could imagine how truly terrifying this triple Attribute Skill would be in
                                            its full power.</p>
                                        <p>Today, the reason Zhou Weiqing had defeated Shen Little Demon could be said
                                            to be him digging deep into his potential, using every skill to their
                                            maximum.</p>
                                        <p>The most critical skills had been the Demonic Attribute ones. Without the
                                            Demonic Change, he wouldn’t be able to hold his own from the beginning.
                                            Without the Devour Skill taking effect twice at the start, Shen Little Demon
                                            wouldn’t have run out of Energy so quickly. More importantly, it enabled him
                                            to sustain his earlier Skill usages, otherwise he would not be able to make
                                            use of powerful skills like the Silver Emperor Spatial Rend and the Dark
                                            Demon God Lightning at the end.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Dark Demon God Lightning, that was naturally the final skill that
                                            was critical in achieving victory. With Shen Little Demon’s cultivation
                                            level, even though she had been suppressed from the beginning, and even
                                            being Controlled by Zhou Weiqing’s Absolute Delay, given enough time to
                                            recover and regain her edge, she would be able to ultimately take the
                                            victory and perhaps even kill him off. It could be said that he had seized
                                            control of the tempo of the battle from the start, and in one fell swoop,
                                            through sheer power and surprise factor, controlled it to the end before
                                            using that terrifying Dark Demon God Lightning to finish it. The amount of
                                            close shaves he had gone through was unbelievable, and only Zhou Weiqing
                                            himself was clear that if he had to go through that once again, he had no
                                            confidence in being able to beat her another time.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, from the start, although Zhou Weiqing had challenged Shen Little
                                            Demon, he had not even dreamed of winning. If it had been before Shangguan
                                            Bing’er leaving, he would still do his best to win the tournament, but he
                                            would not fight in such a ‘senseless’ fight where he had to reveal every
                                            hidden aces he had to the world.</p>
                                        <p>However, now that Shangguan Bing’er had been taken away from him, it burned
                                            inside of him, so much so that he wanted to prove that he had the ability,
                                            the right, the qualification to marry her. In order to do so, not only did
                                            he have to lead his team to a top four post or higher, he had to prove his
                                            own personal strength!</p>
                                        <p>Without any question, a seeded team like the Dan Dun Battle Team, from the
                                            Great Saint Lands, that was his best stage. If he fought with Shen Little
                                            Demon and showed his power, even if he did not gain victory, or couldn’t
                                            show anything else in the later fights, it was still enough.</p>
                                        <p>As such, he changed his style of keeping his cards to his chest in fighting.
                                            As soon as the fight started, he had used his Demonic Change. In Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s original thinking, he would last as long as he could, to suppress
                                            her and control her to his best ability, and when he could no longer take
                                            it, he would admit defeat.</p>
                                        <p>The plan he had told his companions was indeed his real plan to achieve final
                                            team victory.</p>
                                        <p>However, the pressure that Shen Little Demon brought upon him was just too
                                            huge. Just the Holy Flames of Light alone had almost ‘insta-killed’ him. If
                                            not for his quick thinking and reactions, he might have lost his life there
                                            and then, and never seen Bing’er again. Under such a circumstance, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had been angered, and it sparked his hidden potential within him,
                                            finally defeating Shen Little Demon. This was also an unexpected victory
                                            even for himself.</p>
                                        <p>With thirty percent of his meridians shattered, and the rest split apart, how
                                            could he be in a good condition. The numbness had faded, but besides his
                                            head which was still relatively okay, his entire body was a miasma of pain.
                                            The way he was trembling, it looked just as bad as the state Shen Little
                                            Demon was in.</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, how are you feeling?” Lin TianAo asked solemnly.</p>
                                        <p>By that time, Zhou Weiqing was covered in cold sweat. “Dammit, I will not use
                                            this skill again unless absolutely necessary. Ahh, it hurts so bad. Quick,
                                            knock me out, I can’t stand it anymore.”</p>
                                        <p>Crow lowered her head to him, a blissful look upon her face and she said
                                            happily: “Weiqing, before I knock you out, I have to tell you something. We
                                            are rich!! Hahahahahahaha!” As she burst out into a loud cackle, she gave
                                            him a hard slap. Zhou Weiqing did not have any time to react before he
                                            fainted right back into Lin TianAo’s arms.</p>
                                        <p>Rich?!</p>
                                        <p>Only then did the rest of the team remember their bets today.</p>
                                        <p>*PENG* Ye Paopao leapt up, smacking his head onto the roof of the Rest House.
                                            However, he did not even care about the pain, *Pak**Pak**Pak*Pak* He gave
                                            himself four tight slaps.</p>
                                        <p>“Ohhh, I am such an idiot!” [1. He literally says I’m a pig here, but that
                                            kinda has a different tone of insult in english than mandarin XD ]</p>
                                        <p>As he slapped himself, he stomped angrily on the ground.</p>
                                        <p>He was not the only one; besides crow, all the rest of the team members had a
                                            vexed look on their faces.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst the entire Fei Li Battle Team members, Crow had undoubtedly been the
                                            poorest. After winning all the way from the beginning, she had finally
                                            amassed thirty thousand gold coins, definitely peanuts compared to some of
                                            the other team members. However, just in this final fight, both she and Zhou
                                            Weiqing had bet everything they had, while the rest of the team members had
                                            only bet ten thousand gold coins!</p>
                                        <p>None of them had actually truly expected to win, and as such, after they had
                                            actually won, it was only after Crow reminded them that everyone remembered
                                            in a sudden shock that the odds had been 1 to 100!</p>
                                        <p>That was to say… each and every one of them had won a million gold coins!</p>
                                        <p>Well, winning was a good thing, but the problem was… it could have been so
                                            much more!</p>
                                        <p>The reason why Ye Paopao had been so agitated was that he had originally been
                                            the richest of the team. He couldn’t help thinking that if he had bet his
                                            entire fortune of a a million and three hundred thousand gold coins, perhaps
                                            after today he would be richer than his entire family! That was a hundred
                                            million gold coins! Even for the ZhongTian Empire, it was a considerable
                                            sum!</p>
                                        <p>After all, for any common family, their annual expenditure was barely a dozen
                                            gold coins. A hundred million gold coins… what kind of notion was that? It
                                            was probably enough to purchase a few God Tier Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls!</p>
                                        <p>As he thought about that, how could Ye Paopao not feel such a sense of
                                            regret.</p>
                                        <p>After this victory, Crow with her thirty thousand gold coins, had jumped from
                                            being the poorest member to the second richest, only behind Zhou
                                            Weiqing!</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the most disgusting fellow was indeed Zhou Weiqing… after all he
                                            had bet a whole million gold coins! That was to say, he truly had a hundred
                                            million gold coins now!</p>
                                        <p>Everyone turned abruptly to stare at Zhou Weiqing, a green light in their
                                            eyes. [2. Green depicts jealousy, I doubt they are really glowing green =p]
                                            If not for the fact that Zhou Weiqing had already fainted, perhaps the Fei
                                            Li Battle Team Rest House would be bustling in noise and excitement.</p>
                                        <p>Just as the team was suppressing their strange mix feelings of being vexed,
                                            excited and happy, all of a sudden, the loud sound of many footsteps sounded
                                            outside their Rest House. As they turned to look, they saw Shangguan Longyin
                                            leading the Dan Dun Battle Team members to their Rest House, carrying the
                                            unconscious Shen Little Demon.</p>
                                        <p>The Fei Li Battle Team’s hearts tightened, and Lin TianAo quickly stepped
                                            ahead of his companions, saying solemnly: “The fight is over now, what are
                                            you all here for?”</p>
                                        <p>The atmosphere was rather tense. With the top two talents of the Dan Dun
                                            Battle Team with one death and one heavily injured, it was almost without a
                                            doubt that the enmity between the two teams was at an unredeemable high.</p>
