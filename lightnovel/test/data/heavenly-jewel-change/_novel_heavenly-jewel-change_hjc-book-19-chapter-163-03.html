                                        <p>Right at this moment, the Peerless Battalion actually opened ten betting
                                            stations, accepting all bets. The odds they set up were as such: Heavy
                                            Infantry Victory 1:100, Peerless Battalion Victory, 1:1.</p>
                                        <p>Such an action, without a doubt it truly angered the Heavy Infantry Regiment.
                                            At the same time, the entire Northwest Army burst into an uproar.</p>
                                        <p>By daring to open bets with such stakes, it was without a doubt that the
                                            Peerless Battalion had absolute confidence in themselves. At the same time,
                                            it was also a powerful provocation to the Heavy Infantry Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>Some of the more simple-minded immediately rushed to set their bets. In their
                                            minds, since someone was willing to gift them with money, how could they not
                                            accept it?</p>
                                        <p>Those slightly more clever felt that this action by the Peerless Battalion
                                            was just to anger their opponents and to strive for some possible advantages
                                            through that. None of them actually thought that it was the Peerless
                                            Battalion actually being confident in their own abilities.</p>
                                        <p>In that short period of time, there were those who quickly placed their bets,
                                            and those who stood back watching. The reason why so many were just watching
                                            was because they did not believe that the Peerless Battalion would be able
                                            to actually pay out such a bet.</p>
                                        <p>However, that night alone, all those doubts were swiftly dispelled. No one
                                            knew where the Peerless Battalion got a huge sum of gold, forming a pile of
                                            gold at each of the ten betting stations, like a small mountain, each
                                            heavily guarded by many soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>With that, the entire Seventh Legion exploded into action, and the number of
                                            people placing bets increased in an exponential explosion.</p>
                                        <p>The Northwest Army Command also learned about this quickly, but by the time
                                            they thought about stopping it, it was too late. At that point, too many
                                            officers and soldiers alike had already placed their bets on the fight. If
                                            at this point they tried to stop or confiscate the bets, it would without a
                                            doubt be a massive blow to morale.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, to the command, the Peerless Battalion was backed by the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace. This was the reason why the Northwest Army Command
                                            did not easily interfere in their matters. In such a circumstance, this
                                            unbelievably huge bet had been settled.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander, the number of bets are just too many. We are almost
                                            unable to keep up with the records.” Wei Feng rushed to the command tent to
                                            report to Hua Feng. He had placed himself in a proper alignment in terms of
                                            status now that Zhou Weiqing was gone; though he was higher in terms of
                                            cultivation level than Hua Feng, Wei Feng truly admired Hua Feng’s
                                            capabilities and was fully convinced. Everything else aside, just his godly
                                            archery was worthy of his admiration, and he had learnt much from Hua Feng
                                            indeed.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Wei Feng’s words, Hua Feng smiled faintly and said: “No problem. Tell
                                            the betting stations that they only need to record those who bet on us. As
                                            for those who bet on the Heavy Infantry Regiment, they are merely gifting us
                                            the money; we need not care about them. How much gold in wagers have we
                                            accepted by now?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Hua Feng’s words, Wei Feng’s expression turned strange, but he
                                            replied swiftly: “We have already received more than five million gold
                                            coins. In truth, the ordinary soldiers do not wager much; after all they do
                                            not have much money. However, the officers have bet quite a tidy sum…
                                            countless of people are waiting to make a joke out of us.”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng smiled and said: “Let them watch and see for themselves then.”</p>
                                        <p>“Indeed! Let them wait to see a joke then, we will see who has the last
                                            laugh. Ahh, robbing an entire Legion, such a feeling, it is not an ordinary
                                            sense of joy!” The Drunken Rogue, Luo Ke Di, lounged on a chair behind,
                                            saying with a wicked grin on his face.</p>
                                        <p>The seven God Archers of the Heavenly Bow Unit were currently in the tent as
                                            well, as they had been discussing the details of the upcoming fight with the
                                            Heavy Infantry Regiment with Shangguan Fei’er and Lin TianAo.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng said with some worry: “That might be so, but by doing so, we will be
                                            offending the entire Northwest Army…”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng smiled once more. This Wei Feng’s ability was not bad, alas his
                                            sense of the big picture was not there yet, and he lacked the foresight of a
                                            high ranking officer. Well, in the first place, it is Weiqing that little
                                            rascal who is truly the sharp one! In fact, this bet had been arranged by
                                            him before he left. Of course, perhaps there was the shadow of his Scoundrel
                                            teacher behind this scheme, but no one else would know the truth of the
                                            matter. After all, Mu En was lounging there with a carefree look on his
                                            face, as if none of this had any connection with him. However, his right eye
                                            was totally bruised… who knew when he had been punched badly.</p>
                                        <p>“Vice Commander Wei Feng, do not worry. Perhaps, we might be stirring up
                                            public wrath here. However, under the current circumstances, it will not be
                                            a big problem. After all, the main war is upcoming, and the WanShou Empire
                                            armies will soon be bearing down upon the frontlines. Just by losing money,
                                            they will not be able to take it out on us any time soon. As long as we
                                            prove ourselves on the actual battlefield, they will have to swallow the
                                            bitter pill eventually.”</p>
                                        <p>Light dawned upon Wei Feng, and he quickly rushed to arrange everything.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, from outside the tent, a loud voice rang out. “Mu En,
                                            get out here right now!!”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing that voice, Mu En’s face changed instantly, and he fell backwards,
                                            almost tripping over his toppled chair, before flipping back onto his feet
                                            and slipping out of the tent through the side by pulling up the canvas.</p>
                                        <p>Right after he left, Hong Yu charged into the tent from outside. As soon as
                                            she entered, she howled angrily: “Where is Mu En? Where is that wretched Old
                                            Scoundrel?!”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng could not maintain his composure, and he said with quite some
                                            surprise: “Tribe Leader Hong Yu, what is the matter?”</p>
                                        <p>Hong Yu gave an angry humph and said: “Battalion Commander Hua Feng, please
                                            do not interfere in this matter. If I do not beat up that old thing until
                                            his own mother cannot recognize him, I will not be called Hong Yu
                                            anymore!”</p>
                                        <p>Yi Shi gave the ‘orchid shaped fingers’ sign, saying: “Big sis, what is the
                                            matter? What did Mu En do to you?”</p>
                                        <p>Hong Yu said angrily: “That Old Scoundrel dared to peek at me bathing!”</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing those words, the entire tent was struck dumb momentarily. In the
                                            next instant, they all pointed at the side where Mu En had snuck out of.
                                            Only then did Hong Yu turn and charge out of the tent with another angry
                                            humph.</p>
                                        <p>After she had disappeared from sight, only then did the Heavenly Bow Unit
                                            members exchange helpless looks. In the end, all their gazes landed on Luo
                                            Ke Di, who shrugged and said innocently: “Why are you all looking at me like
                                            that? I did not go, I do not have such ‘heavy’ tastes like that Old
                                            Scoundrel…”</p>
                                        <p>A pause later, he gave in and continued: “... Alright, alright… I’ll tell the
                                            truth. Yesterday, he asked me to go along with him, saying that the Gold
                                            Crow Tribe were full of unique beauties and we should have a look for
                                            ourselves. However, I had drank too much and did not feel like moving, so I
                                            did not join him. Sigh… if he went to peek, that is fine, yet he actually
                                            got caught. Aiyah… that Old Scoundrel has regressed…”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng rubbed his forehead and said: “I hope he doesn’t get torn into bits.
                                            That taste… it is truly not ordinarily ‘heavy’. Tribe Leader Hong Yu… her
                                            figure is even more powerful than Crow! With her cultivation level, if she
                                            just gives Mu En a slap… I don’t even dare imagine it…”</p>
                                        <p>Shui Cao gave him a sheep’s eye and said: “In the end, I am still better
                                            right, look how gentle I am towards you!”</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Shangguan Fei’er could not continue watching any longer, and
                                            she snuck out of the tent to start preparing for the fight. She was truly
                                            starting to understand why Zhou Little Fatty was so ‘bad’... with such a
                                            bunch of teachers…….</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er had barely left, and the inglorious middle aged folks of the
                                            Heavenly Bow Unit had already started placing bets amongst themselves.</p>
                                        <p>Gao Shen exclaimed without hesitation: “I bet that Mu En will have to recover
                                            in bed for at least a month.”</p>
                                        <p>“I bet two months!” Shui Cao grinned and said.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng furrowed his brow and looked at them all, saying: “If you all want
                                            to bet, I will not stop you. However, who will be the banker? Don’t look at
                                            me, I do not have any interests in such unstable bets with high chance of
                                            losing.”</p>
                                        <p>“How about me? I’ll be the banker.” Luo Ke Di said, clearly still in a
                                            drunken sleepy state.</p>
                                        <p>The others exchanged looks. Having him in such a drunken state, if they did
                                            not seize the opportunity to con him, that would be rude of them!</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng asked: “As the banker, what are your terms of betting?”</p>
                                        <p>Luo Ke Di burped, filling the tent with the scent of alcohol. “I bet that it
                                            will not take long, and Tribe Leader Hong Yu will bring the Old Scoundrel
                                            back like a little bird that rests upon a man [1. Direct Translation of
                                            小鸟依人. Basically means a woman who is acting charming and coquettish /
                                            flirtatious]. Furthermore, she will be gazing tenderly at him, even marrying

                                        <p>Everyone’s mouths twitched at the same time, almost an uncontrollable
                                            convulsion. Yi Shi said in a high pitched voice: “This fellow has really
                                            drank too much. Alright then, we’ll bet with you!”</p>

                                            Heavenly Bow Unit, and the rest swiftly placed their bets. The only one who
                                            did not bet was the unusually silent Han Mo.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng looked to Han Mo and asked: “Arrow Tower, why didn’t you place a
                                            bet?”</p>
                                        <p>Han Mo shook his head and said: “I’m afraid of losing.”</p>
                                        <p>Gao Shen said in surprise: “Losing to this drunkard? How can that be
                                            possible? Didn’t you hear the terms of his bet?”</p>
                                        <p>Han Mo said passively: “All I know is that amongst all of us, the one who
                                            knows that Old Scoundrel the best is him, and the two of them are the
                                            closest. When have you seen that Old Scoundrel do anything without a
                                            plan.”</p>
                                        <p>“Something is up!”</p>
                                        <p>Subconsciously, all of them turned to look at Luo Ke Di, only to see that
                                            fellow sweeping up all the wagered gold into his Spatial Ring as quickly as
                                            possible.</p>
                                        <p>Sensing the atmosphere in the tent had changed, and not in his favour, the
                                            previously seemingly drunk Luo Ke Di raised his head and smiled sheepishly:
                                            “What do you mean something is up! I don’t know anything.”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng grit his teeth and said: “Speak. If you spill the beans, we will
                                            treat is as paying for information. Otherwise… you know the
                                            consequences…”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the bunch of them rubbing their palms eagerly, Luo Ke Di could
                                            only give a pitiful look and say: “Alright, alright, I will tell you all
                                            everything. As you all should already know, all these years, Mu En has been
                                            wearing a mask right.”</p>
                                        <p>The rest of them nodded subconsciously. The fact that Mu En wore a mask was a
                                            secret that only the few of them in the Heavenly Bow Unit knew, and even
                                            Zhou Weiqing did not know it. However, it seemed clear they did not the know
                                            the reason behind that. Luo Ke Di continued: “The reason why Mu En wears the
                                            mask is actually because of Tribe Leader Hong Yu… to put things more
                                            clearly… Crow is… actually Mu En’s daughter……”</p>
                                        <p>*Plop**Plop**Plop**Plop* Eyeballs fell and shattered onto the ground… [3. He
                                            writes it literally as a play on idioms. I have to say I was shocked
                                            too!]</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>The second day, past noon. The time for the fight had come.</p>
                                        <p>The betting stations of the Peerless Battalion had been accepting bets all
                                            the way until this point, and by this time they had accumulated wagers of
                                            almost ten million gold coins. In the army, this was already quite a
                                            terrifying amount; after all soldiers or even officers were not that rich.
                                            If not for the fact that the entire Northwest Army, including all support
                                            and logistics personnel, numbered more than a million strong, it would be
                                            nearly impossible to see such a large sum of money in a bet. At the same
                                            time, this bet had already become such a grand matter that the entire
                                            Northwest Army was paying close attention to.</p>
                                        <p>The Seventh Legion’s Heavy Infantry Regiment had come out to the outskirts of
                                            the camp rather early. They did not bring their weapons, but were fully
                                            geared in their heavy armours. Even from a distance, their strong fighting
                                            spirit and killing intent could be sensed.</p>
                                        <p>After all, which army troop could take such insult and provocation without
                                            feeling anger? Clearly, the Heavy Infantry Regiment were not such!</p>
                                        <p>The pay of the Heavy Infantry soldiers were some of the highest amongst the
                                            entire army. This time, the entire Heavy Infantry Regiment, from soldier to
                                            the highest officer, all of them bet everything they had down to their
                                            underwear on this fight. At this point, their fighting spirit was burning at
                                            an unbelievable height. Perhaps even when fighting against the WanShou
                                            Empire, they did not even have such a powerful fighting spirit. They all
                                            stood there at the ready, their eyes bloodshot, as if they could already see
                                            the Peerless Battalion soldiers falling down at their feet.</p>
                                        <p>In stark contrast with them, only when the time came for the fight did the
                                            Peerless Battalion slowly exit their camp.</p>
