                                            then it would undoubtedly leave an unforgettable shadow in his heart and
                                            mind. If that really happened, perhaps it would cause trouble in the future
                                            if he met any cultivation bottlenecks, possibly preventing him from breaking
                                            through in future. This was not something that Long Shiya wanted to see.
                                            Furthermore, in terms of feelings, he did not want to see Zhou Weiqing
                                            suffer as well.</p>
                                        <p>Regarding Zhou Weiqing’s Empire’s destruction and lost family, Long Shiya
                                            could stand aside and not give full assistance… that was mainly to put him
                                            through the hard school of adversity, to allow him to grow through the
                                            experience. However, in this current matter, if Long Shiya did not come
                                            forward, it would be impossible for Zhou Weiqing to actually come up the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain, let alone solve anything. As such, Long Shiya had
                                            come forward without hesitation.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, there was one other reason.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya’s lifelong greatest goal had always been to become the strongest
                                            in the world; and to do that he had to defeat Xue AoTian. However, he knew
                                            that in this life it was unlikely he would have such a chance any longer, as
                                            he was unable to breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage after so many years.
                                            As such, he had placed all his hopes on his precious new disciple. Of
                                            course, now there was a chance of ‘defeating’ Xue AoTian within his
                                            lifetime… if Zhouo Weiqing could actually marry Xue AoTian’s daughter, and
                                            bring her back with him, it could be said that it would be a victory of
                                            sorts over Xue AoTian. Although this was not exactly a victory of might, but
                                            Long Shiya would still feel extremely happy. As such, no matter from which
                                            angle, he would do as he promised and bring Zhou Weiqing up the Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain, even if the chance of success was barely ten to twenty
                                            percent.</p>
                                        <p>After they arrived, the series of actions that both Long Shiya and Zhou
                                            Weiqing had gone through were fully designed towards constructing an
                                            atmosphere that was of great advantage to them. From the current situation,
                                            Long Shiya knew that Little Fatty’s chance of success had definitely risen
                                            far beyond their own expectations. At least, it was clear that Xue AoTian’s
                                            inner feelings were no longer against Zhou Weiqing, perhaps even partial
                                            towards him!</p>
                                        <p>Of course, this was just Long Shiya’s own estimation, and he still did not
                                            know what was about to happen in the near future. Would he still be worried
                                            about the competition rules of this first test that Xue AoTian had proposed?
                                            If one would ask Long Shiya that question, his reply would only be a cold
                                            laugh.</p>
                                        <p>Putting on a vexed and annoyed look, Long Shiya suddenly grit his teeth and
                                            said angrily towards Xue AoTian: “Fine. Old Monster Xue, you are indeed
                                            ruthless. I accept those conditions. However, you better keep your word. If
                                            my disciple wins all three of those tests, none of you are allowed to
                                            prevent him from bringing your daughter away.”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian gave Long Shiya a dismissive glance and a cold humph before
                                            turning to the Lion King Gu Site. “Bro Gu, what do you think?”</p>
                                        <p>Gu Site laughed heartily and said grandly: “I will follow your lead, Mountain
                                            Lord.” In his eyes, his son could not possibly lose with such favourable
                                            terms. Just in terms of bloodline, their Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion
                                            bloodline might lose out to the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline by a
                                            narrow hair, but it was already at the top tier in the entire continent. How
                                            could he possibly lose to a mere human disciple of Long Shiya? Furthermore,
                                            he also had the advantage of cultivation level. With his own Heavenly
                                            Emperor cultivation level, he could easily tell that Zhou Weiqing was only
                                            at the six-Jeweled stage. Although a youth of lesser than twenty years
                                            reaching the six-Jeweled stage was an astonishing feat, it would not change
                                            the fact that he still had not grown to his full potential yet, and was
                                            still much lower than his son.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian nodded and said: “In that case, this old man will be the judge of
                                            this competition, along with Xue Aoying. We will ensure absolute fairness in
                                            the actual competition. Alright, both you young men can start preparing
                                            yourselves. I will personally select the Heavenly Beasts for this first
                                            competition.”</p>
                                        <p>“Old Monster Xue, wait a moment.” Long Shiya said.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian turned to him questioningly.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya continued: “Old Monster Xue, you said there are three
                                            competitions. What are the other two?”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian gave a cold laugh and said: “Wait until your disciple actually
                                            wins the first round before we talk. If he loses the first round, what is
                                            the point of talking about the second or third round now?” After saying
                                            that, he turned and walked off, not even giving Long Shiya the chance to
                                            retort. At least from an outward appearance, Xue AoTian was totally on the
                                            side of Gu Site and Gu Yingbing. That was also a reasonable assumption, as
                                            the WanShou Empire should technically be fighting on the same side.</p>
                                        <p>However, at this point, the Tiger King’s eyes flashed with a hint of
                                            surprise. The Tiger King Xue Aoying had grown up from a young age together
                                            with this big brother of his. Xue AoTian was ten years older than him, and
                                            had always taken care of him all the way. To Xue Aoying, Xue AoTian was not
                                            just a big brother, almost even like a father figure. Having grown up
                                            together, Xue Aoying was knew his big brother extremely well.</p>
                                        <p>Under any normal circumstance, especially in front of outsiders, Xue AoTian
                                            would usually not act so domineering. The terms of this competition just
                                            seemed way too unfair, and so unlike his big brother’s character! Xue
                                            Aoying’s heart was puzzled, but just a little. After all, to him, no matter
                                            who won this competition, it did not really affect him at all. He was just a
                                            relatively indifferent bystander who would just watch the show on the
                                            sidelines.</p>
                                        <p>Leading Zhou Weiqing along, Long Shiya went to the side to sit down. With a
                                            simple thought, powerful Heavenly Dao Energy sprang forth to surround both
                                            of them in a protective barrier, preventing them from being heard.</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty, how sure are you of winning this first round?” Long Shiya
                                            asked solemnly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Master, I can say with confidence that
                                            this round is a guaranteed victory for myself.”</p>
                                        <p>“Ohh?” Long Shiya looked at his precious disciple with an amused look, his
                                            lip curling in the shadow of a smile. “Pride comes before a fall, and it is
                                            a dangerous vice for a Heavenly Jewel Master to have.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Master, you should know how
                                            important this competition is to me, I would not want to lose due to
                                            overconfidence as well. All that is in my mind now is how I can win. Master,
                                            I am sure that you can tell as well… the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord does
                                            not seem to actually hold much enmity towards me. Furthermore… this first
                                            test he has brought up is extremely strange!”</p>
                                        <p>It was Long Shiya’s turn to be surprised. The reason why he could judge that
                                            about Xue AoTian was because of the meaningful glance that he had given him.
                                            Yet, Long Shiya was extremely sure that he was the only one who could have
                                            seen that, with how Xue AoTian did it, even the Lion King and Tiger King,
                                            powerhouses that they were, had not detected anything amiss. As such, Zhou
                                            Weiqing could not possibly have seen it as well. Yet, he was still able to
                                            make such a judgement call. From that alone, one could tell how powerful his
                                            disciple’s observation skills and analysis was.</p>
                                        <p>“Master, in this matter, I am certain that my bloodline has a vast advantage.
                                            If I have not guessed wrongly, the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue must have
                                            changed his mind after speaking to Tian’er, and his heart has softened.
                                            Although he might not have actually fully approved of me yet, in bringing up
                                            such a test, he is definitely giving me a chance. This is a true test for me
                                            in his eyes.” Zhou Weiqing said confidently.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said passively: “In doing anything, there is always a chance. The
                                            only difference is how great the chance is. Since you have already chosen to
                                            come here, then you must put your all, go to all lengths to win. At the same
                                            time, you must not look down on the bloodline of their Heavenly Divine Earth
                                            Spirit Lion tribe. After all, the power of bloodlines will be influenced by
                                            cultivation level, and the cultivation level gap between you and Gu Yingbing
                                            is not inconsiderable. I never expected that little brat to have broken
                                            through to the nine-Jeweled stage. So, you better be careful. Don’t think of
                                            anything else, just focus on gaining this first victory, and it will also
                                            give us an edge for momentum and presence, increasing our overall chances of
                                            victory. Furthermore, it looks like the Tiger King is not on good terms with
                                            the Lion King, see if you can make use of that point in any way.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded. He was not one to be careless, especially when this
                                            concerned both his own and Tian’er’s future! This was his only chance!</p>
                                        <p>At once, Zhou Weiqing sat down at the side in a meditation position, closing
                                            his eyes as he began cultivating, trying to ensure that his Heavenly Energy
                                            was at his peak before the competition. Although technically his Heavenly
                                            Energy would normally be at the peak even if he didn’t do that, due to his
                                            Immortal Deity Technique, he would not waste any chance to improve his
                                            spiritual energy, even just a little.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s appearance, in Gu Yingbing’s eyes that translated
                                            to severe lack of confidence. He would not follow suit. In his eyes, this
                                            so-called competition or test was merely a formality, something his Master
                                            had came up with to shut Long Shiya’s mouth. After this first round, this
                                            Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and his lowly disciple would have to slink off
                                            dejectedly.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, the Lion King Gu Site was also not worried for his son. Gu
                                            Yingbing could be said to be Gu Site’s greatest pride. He was extremely
                                            clear that despite the sheer strength and power of the WanShou Empire, which
                                            was far superior to any individual human Empire, but with the existence of
                                            the other Great Saint Lands, they would not be able to annex all the human
                                            Empires. No matter how strong the Heavenly Snow Mountain was, they would not
                                            be able to take on the other four Great Saint Lands, or even three, ignoring
                                            the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p>
                                        <p>If not for the shared counter restraints of the five Great Saint Lands,
                                            perhaps the war between the WanShou Empire and the human Empires could have
                                            already destroyed the entire mainland.</p>
                                        <p>Yet, the Lion King Gu Site still had his own ambitions. On all outward
                                            appearances, he seemed to be a coarse or negligent person, but he was
                                            actually a very careful and detailed person. In his lifetime, he might not
                                            be able to accomplish all his goals, but that did not mean his son would not
                                            be able to do so in the future. As long as Gu Yingbing was able to gain the
                                            position of the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, then anything might be
                                            possible! At least, the first step was for the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit
                                            Lion Tribe to gain control of the entire Heavenly Snow Mountain, and thus
                                            true control of the WanShou Empire.</p>
                                        <p>All these years, although the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers ruled the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain, but in the WanShou Empire, the Heavenly Divine Earth
                                            Spirit Lions had also controlled the Royal Family for so many years. If Gu
                                            Yingbing inherited the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord position, although the
                                            Royal Family would change to the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers, but who
                                            would truly control the power? More importantly, if one day Xue AoTian was
                                            no longer with them, then… would there be a need for the Divine Heavenly
                                            Spirit Tigers any more?</p>
                                        <p>Of course, these were all just possibilities in the future. The most
                                            important thing now was to solidify his son’s position in the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain. This Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor might cause the Lion King Gu
                                            Site to be wary, but it was just keeping on his guard. After all, Long Shiya
                                            was just alone. This was a huge advantage of his, but also a great
                                            disadvantage. On the larger scale of matters, or the big picture, just his
                                            lone existence would not be able to influence things too much, no matter his
                                            power. Furthermore, in this matter, it seemed clear that Xue AoTian was
                                            fully on their side. This Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was just a joke in
                                            his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Meanwhile, Xue AoTian had left the Grand Hall for quite some time, much
                                            longer than the group had anticipated.</p>
