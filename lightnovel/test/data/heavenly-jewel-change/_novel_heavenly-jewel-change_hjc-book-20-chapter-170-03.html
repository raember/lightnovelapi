                                            flight yet. At last, he was unable to avoid the Wind Blade, and with a soft
                                            thud, it slammed savagely into his back.</p>
                                        <p>The moment before he had been struck, Zhou Weiqing felt as if everything
                                            around his body lit up. Subconsciously, he looked back down on his body, and
                                            he was surprised to see that his entire person was glowing a bright purple.
                                            A gentle warmth burst forth from all his limbs, bones and entire body
                                            abruptly, spreading out. The attack of the Wind Blade was undoubtedly
                                            extremely powerful, but it seemed to only have a simple impact on his body,
                                            causing him to fly forward but he did not feel any sense of pain.</p>
                                        <p>With a quick flip of his hands, Zhou Weiqing stroked the area on his back
                                            where he had been hit. This time, he was even more surprised to realise that
                                            his arm had actually bent strangely in an inhuman way to actually reach his
                                            back.</p>
                                        <p>As for his back, not a single mark was left behind, and his skin was smooth
                                            and gleaming as ever, feeling fine and delicate like a young girl’s skin. As
                                            for the purple light, it formed layer after layer of scales made of light,
                                            looking rather weird.</p>
                                        <p>“Come down. Long Shiya’s voice rang out once more in his ears.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing managed to control his wings, however unpracticed, to slowly
                                             descend. At least his spiritual control was not too bad, and he did not
                                            make a fool of himself in landing. At this moment, his heart was full of
                                            shock; his body seemed to have changed in unprecedented manner, almost like
                                            everything had been turned upside down… and these changes should be from the
                                            Awakening of his Solidified Dragon Spirit and its fusion with his Dark Demon
                                            God Tiger bloodline. As for what these changes were exactly, he was still
                                            not fully clear on what they were. However, it was without question that
                                            this strange purple coloured transformation of his was far superior to his
                                            previous Demonic Change State. Not only did it have all the advantages of
                                            the Demonic Change State, they had been strengthened manifold, with other
                                            additions to it as it seemed. More importantly, he was now able to maintain
                                            this new Demonic Change State for a much longer time. Even after Zhou
                                            Weiqing landed on the ground and withdrew the Demonic Change State, he could
                                            still sense that some of the changes were still active within his body.
                                            However, if his body wasn’t under the purple transformation state, he would
                                            not be able to fully use all those changes.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya looked over Zhou Weiqing before nodding his head in satisfaction.
                                            “Very good, a much higher defensive capability than I had even thought. It
                                            looks like Solidified Dragon Spirit has improved upon one of the weaker
                                            points of the Demonic Change State, your defense. Also, it seems your
                                            physical strength has also been further improved. The fusion of the two
                                            powerful bloodlines you have has brought you a far greater change than
                                            merely the Solidified Dragon Spirit. As for what it has brought you exactly,
                                            it is up to us to explore and test out fully. From now on, I will give you
                                            four hours per day to familiarise yourself with your new body. As for the
                                            rest of the time, I will begin training you on how to truly use the Six
                                            Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts.</p>
                                        <p>“Master, it seems that this current transformation of mine is no longer
                                            simply the Demonic Change State, and I do not have to inflame my emotions as
                                            much just to enter it. More so, it seems like it is almost a constant state,
                                            only when I enter the purple stage its power is greatly strengthened and the
                                            wings come out to allow me to fly. Should I give it another name
                                            instead?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya smiled and said: “How about… ‘Dragon-Tiger Transformation’! After
                                            all, it was brought about by your two dragon and tiger bloodlines.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s mouth twitched slightly. “This… this doesn’t even sound as
                                            cool as the Demonic Change State! How about… Lord Emperor Transformation or
                                            something awesome like that?!”</p>
                                        <p>“Cool your head! You might as well call it ‘shit’. Enough nonsense, let me
                                            first test how much that defensive capability of your Dragon-Tiger
                                            Transformation has actually improved.”</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that fresh hideous grin on Long Big Fatty’s face, Zhou Weiqing turned
                                            pale and turned in an attempt to run. Alas, with his cultivation level, how
                                            could he possibly escape from the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor? In moments,
                                            cries of agony rang out from the top of the volcano.</p>
                                        <p>Beating was definitely a must. If he did not beat Zhou Weiqing up savagely,
                                            how could they know what the new limits of his defenses would be, and when
                                            facing any enemies, not knowing your own defense to make accurate judgements
                                            would make it easy to lose out.</p>
                                        <p>After much ‘testing’, Long Shiya’s surprise grew stronger. He discovered that
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s evolving this time had been truly thorough. It seemed like
                                            not just his two powerful bloodlines had been fused together, but the
                                            Immortal Deity Technique had somehow been integrated within as well.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing’s was under attack, the first defensive effect that was
                                            produced was actually from his skin, becoming almost like tough armour, able
                                            to withstand any attack from six-Jeweled cultivation level and below,
                                            perhaps even higher. Tough and flexible indeed.</p>
                                        <p>As the offensive power of the attacks grew stronger, up to the level beyond
                                            what Zhou Weiqing’s skin could withstand, his muscles and bones would well
                                            up with strength, all the way up to the surface of the skin, strengthening
                                            the defense. At the same time, his Immortal Deity Technique would
                                            automatically transfer Heavenly Energy to the surface of the skin,
                                            presenting in a layer of purple light, once again improving the defensive
                                            capabilities several fold. This was the profound secret that had emerged
                                            after the merging of the Immortal Deity Shield to his bloodlines.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that for the current Zhou Weiqing, even if one totally
                                            ignored his offensive capabilities, just considering his defensive
                                            capabilities alone, he was already at a terrifying level. More importantly,
                                            these defenses were automatically triggered, almost passive even, and he did
                                            not need to control or activate them with his own will. That was to say, he
                                            did not need to worry about being ambushed or caught off guard.</p>
                                        <p>More importantly, even if he was not in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s own personal defense was already able to reach at least sixty to
                                            seventy percent of his full defense in that State.</p>
                                        <p>Not only that; when he entered the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s power could be said to go through a total change, an upheaval
                                            even. The introduction of the Solidified Dragon Spirit to all his powers not
                                            only brought Zhou Weiqing a full true immunity to fire, it also brought
                                            about an immunity to the Darkness Attribute. That was to say... as long as
                                            any Skills or attacks of these two Attributes landed on Zhou Weiqing, the
                                            only effect they would have would be the impact as well as pure Heavenly
                                            Energy, and none of the effects of the skills brought about by the
                                            Attributes. If the attack was of the Darkness or Fire Attribute, then it
                                            would most likely not even be of much harm to Zhou Weiqing at all. For
                                            example, if the effect of a particular Fire Attribute Skill was a high level
                                            scorching type one, then what would its use be on him at all.</p>
                                        <p>In Long Shiya’s words, due to the fact that Zhou Weiqing did not have the
                                            Fire Attribute, the Solidified Dragon Spirit was unable to give him any
                                            powerful Skills. However, at the same time, when the Solidified Dragon
                                            Spirit had fully fused with Zhou Weiqing, all its benefits had been focused
                                            on his physical body instead. Not only was he no longer afraid of Fire, when
                                            he entered melee combat with an enemy, his attacks would be imbued with the
                                            Fire Attribute passively. Furthermore, when his hands warped into the dragon
                                            claws, the destructive power of them were no different from any real dragon
                                            claws, of course the difference in strength aside. Once he used his Yin Yang
                                            Giant Spirit Palms, the sheer terrifying offensive power was such that even
                                            Long Shiya would not be easily willing to take such a blow easily. It would
                                            not be a good feelings at all.</p>
                                        <p>The greatest benefit of Consolidated Equipment was that they could change
                                            according to their user’s physical conditions, and did not need to take a
                                            particular fixed state. For example, for the current Zhou Weiqing, if he was
                                            in his transformed state and he used the Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palm, the
                                            palm area of the equipment would form in the dragon clawed shape as
                                            well.</p>
                                        <p>After discovering the massive changes to Zhou Weiqing’s body, Long Shiya
                                            modified his original plan. In three days, he had helped Zhou Weiqing to
                                            fully explore all the changes in his body, with not a single detail left
                                            unexplored. Once he had familiarised himself with his body, it would be of
                                            great benefit for him to practice and master the Six Ultimate Skill
                                            Manipulation Arts. Especially after learning how Zhou Weiqing’s wings could
                                            draw in Heavenly Energy from the atmosphere and how powerful that effect
                                            was, the more Long Shiya wanted him to examine his Transformation.</p>
                                        <p>Three days had passed. Although they couldn’t say that Zhou Weiqing had fully
                                            grasped control his new body, he had at least understood all the changes in
                                            his body. He had also improved in his winged flight, at least relatively in
                                            control now, with some simple flying techniques. After all, that was what
                                            Shangguan Fei’er was best at, and though Zhou Weiqing might not have the
                                            ability to fly in the past, he had seen her fly so many times that he had
                                            learned something. As the saying goes, even if one hasn’t eaten pork before,
                                            they had to have seen pigs run. As such, his practice proceeded pretty
                                            decently at least. Of course, he would not dare describe it as such to
                                            Shangguan Fei’er.</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty, come here.” Long Shiya beckoned to Zhou Weiqing, who had just
                                            finished eating his breakfast.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood there hesitantly, a wary look on his face. The last three
                                            days, he had been miserably beaten by Long Shiya in order to test the limits
                                            of his new body, and Long Big Fatty had shown no mercy at all. He had often
                                            been beaten to the very limit before Long Shiya had stopped, no matter how
                                            much Zhou Weiqing screamed in pain or used all of his considerable acting
                                            skills, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor could clearly sense the changes in
                                            his bodies and all the acting was useless. Currently, when Long Shiya called
                                            out to him, Zhou Weiqing was afraid that a fresh round of beating would
                                            await him, how could he be willing to jump to it eagerly?</p>
                                        <p>“Hurry up.” Long Shiya said exasperatedly.</p>
                                        <p>Only then did Zhou Weiqing walk up unwillingly back to his Master, but his
                                            heart was still wary. He had to be prepared in case of another beating after
                                            all!</p>
                                        <p>Looking at his reluctant look, Long Shiya couldn’t help but laugh out loud
                                            before saying: “Look at you with that good for nothing expression, isn’t it
                                            just two days of being beaten? It is natural for masters to beat their
                                            disciples! Hmph, don’t worry, the beatings are over… we have gathered enough
                                            data on your body. From today onwards, I will be starting the real training
                                            of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, the true power of the Six
                                            Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation. We do not have much time left… before
                                            we head out for the Heavenly Snow Mountain, you need to have a basic grasp
                                            on the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation.</p>
                                        <p>Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation? This was the first time Zhou
                                            Weiqing had heard of this term. Originally, when Long Shiya had taught him
                                            his Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, it had been the bare basics, and
                                            not the intricacies of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation.</p>
