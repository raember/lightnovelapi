                                        <p>Spatial Shackles - Zhou Weiqing’s third Spatial Skill. As Tang Xian had
                                            adviced him previously, he specifically looked for another control type
                                            skill to Skill Store for his third Jewel, and the Spatial Shackles was at
                                            least of an 8 Star Rating or more.</p>
                                        <p>The time which the Spatial Shackles lasted was even longer than his Fetters
                                            of Wind and Touch of Darkness! At the 3-Jeweled level of power, the Spatial
                                            Shackles lasted almost eight seconds; of course this was on a target of
                                            similar power as him, and provided the target did not struggle and attack
                                            it.</p>
                                        <p>In this eight seconds, the target would be trapped in a light wrapping which
                                            contained a spatial dimension. The target would not be able to effect the
                                            outside world, but neither could Zhou Weiqing attack the target; until the
                                            Spatial Shackles were broken. As such, although this Skill had an extremely
                                            powerful control factor, it lacked the ability to complement attacks. Of
                                            course, it couldn’t be said to be useless or weak either, its greatest usage
                                            was to interrupt enemies. Furthermore, there were other uses for it as well,
                                            and not just on enemies. In certain critical times, this could even be used
                                            to save a friend or companion. As such, this was considered one of the
                                            better Spatial Skills as well.</p>
                                        <p>“Dammit, if I don’t show you my power, you’ll look down on me huh.” Zhou
                                            Weiqing panted as he snarled out in anger. Within the small, confined area
                                            of the house, he was not able to use his bow or his archery. Alas, his
                                            strongest power was currently his archery, and he had confidence that if
                                            they were a hundred yards apart, let alone Ming Hua - even her brother Ming
                                            Yu would be no match for him. However, in this confined space, it would not
                                            be so easy to deal with someone like her.</p>
                                        <p>A strong dark gold light erupted from his second Icy Jade Physical Jewel,
                                            causing it to shine brilliantly. As Zhou Weiqing lifted his arms up, the
                                            gold light instantly formed a huge barrier of light around him, causing his
                                            entire body to be hidden from sight.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Ming Hua, who was stuck in the Spatial Shackles, witnessed
                                            the scene, her eyes filled with shock.</p>
                                        <p>She had previously been surprised once again when Zhou Weiqing used the
                                            Spatial Shackles on her, as it was yet another top level, high rating Skill.
                                            However, she was rather familiar with most of the skills, and naturally knew
                                            the various characteristics of the skills and how to deal with them. As
                                            such, she did not attempt to break free from the Spatial Shackles, instead
                                            gathering up her strength and waiting for an opportunity to strike. When the
                                            Spatial Shackles ended, she would launch a second furious salvo of
                                            attacks.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, she did not expect to see that Zhou Weiqing would release something
                                            that caused her so much surprise - his own Consolidated Equipment Set!</p>
                                        <p>Seeing a piece of Consolidated Equipment glowing dark gold was definitely the
                                            first time for Ming Hua. Normally, the colour and aura of Consolidated
                                            Equipment was the same as the Physical Jewel which it was formed from, and
                                            there was only one exception… that was Consolidated Equipment Sets. For
                                            example, her current Consolidated Equipment Set was green in colour, and not
                                            the waxy Jade colour of her Physical Jewels.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, Ming Hua also knew that, the bigger the contrast in colour from
                                            the original colour of the Physical Jewel, the stronger the set would
                                            be!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s Icy Jade Physical Jewel was bordering between a transparent
                                            colourless-ness and pure white, swirling with a misty white. Yet, this
                                            Consolidated Equipment was such a dark gold that was almost closing in on
                                            black. Such a stark contrast was indeed one of the reasons why it was such a
                                            huge surprise to her. The other reason was that when he Consolidated this
                                            piece of Equipment, his body actually shone with that black gold aura.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of non military knowledge, especially in terms of Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters, Ming Hua’s knowledge probably surpassed even her elder brother Ming
                                            Yu. Towards Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, she had a large interest.
                                            Although she was not a Spatial Attribute Consolidating Equipment Master, but
                                            with the Life Attribute, she was able to assist other Consolidating
                                            Equipment Masters in creating scrolls. As such, she knew many outstanding
                                            Consolidating Equipment Grandmasters or even higher level ones. Thus, she
                                            easily recognized the black gold aura that shone around Zhou Weiqing… it was
                                            perhaps something she had only heard about and never witnessed before -
                                            Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura.</p>
                                        <p>Such an aura… would only appear for the very top, highest quality of
                                            Consolidated Equipment… either Sets or single pieces.</p>
                                        <p>However, the only condition for it appearing was that the Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scroll had to be created by a God Tier Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master! The Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura only lasted a mere
                                            second, but during this second, it would provide a protection which was more
                                            than 10 times the greatest defensive power of the user - which meant, it was
                                            nearly impossible to interrupt the Consolidating of this Equipment!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had already given Ming Hua a lot of surprises today. After all,
                                            she was famous for being nearly undefeated by anyone of the same level! Yet…
                                            today, facing Zhou Weiqing, who was only 3-Jeweled as compared to her 4, she
                                            had actually been forced to use her Consolidated Equipment Sets in order to
                                            suppress him. Now, looking at the piece of Equipment that Zhou Weiqing
                                            unleashed, it seemed like it was something that was even much higher quality
                                            than her own set!</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua was indeed learned, and her judgement was very accurate. What Zhou
                                            Weiqing was unleashing was the single Legendary Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scroll that Huyan Aobo had given him. It was only the single scroll, and was
                                            the first piece of his Legendary Set, but Zhou Weiqing made use of the
                                            unique qualities of his body and managed to successfully Consolidate it.
                                            That black-gold aura was indeed its Consolidating Equipment God Protective
                                            Aura.</p>
                                        <p>This Legendary Set was just too powerful, even though the creator of this
                                            particular scroll was not a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, but the
                                            person who designed the entire set was one of the top God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Masters. As such, it still had the Consolidating Equipment God
                                            Protective Aura.</p>
                                        <p>The thick black-gold aura glowed and gathered around Zhou Weiqing’s hands,
                                            thickening and coalescing. Previously, Zhou Weiqing had tried releasing this
                                            piece of Consolidated Equipment before to examine it, but had never used it
                                            in actual combat before.</p>
                                        <p>In the next instant, the black gold aura vanished, and a pair of heavy
                                            hammers appeared in Zhou Weiqing’s hands. The shaft of the hammers were
                                            about 2 chi long, almost as thick as a baby’s arm, while the tip of the
                                            hammer ended in a spike. On the shaft, there were fine dark gold lines
                                            forming strange tattoos, glowing brightly. Both hammer heads were rather
                                            large, spanning almost two chi as well from tip to tip, almost
                                            over-exaggeratedly large. They were not in a perfect round ends, but with
                                            several protrusions, almost like the markings of a watermelon, fully
                                            black-gold. The strangest thing was that there was a weird image on each
                                            hammer head - the face of a man. And even stranger still, one was with a
                                            laughing face and the other with a crying face. Due to the bright glow, if
                                            one did not examine the images clearly, the differences in them might be
                                            missed.</p>
                                        <p>With such a huge pair of hammers, it would take someone of Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            size for them to not look absurd wielding them, but even so they did seem a
                                            little overdone. The huge hammer heads looked terrifying. Without a doubt,
                                            only strength boost Heavenly Jewel Masters would be able to wield such
                                            Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Zhou Weiqing was rather gloomy when he completed Consolidating
                                            this piece of Equipment. His biggest hope had been this would be something
                                            like a shield instead… After all, safety first was something that was always
                                            in his mind. However, after a moment of consideration, he was quickly
                                            delighted once more. The reason was simple - with such huge hammer heads,
                                            they could easily be used as a small shield as well! Furthermore, the
                                            overbearing look that he had while holding the pair of hammers, he truly
                                            liked it. The thing that delighted him the most though, was its power and
                                            usage.</p>
                                        <p>On that Legendary Set Equipment Scroll, there had been transcribed a single
                                            sentence… “Good and evil, illusion and reality - Legendary Dual God Strength
                                            Hammers...”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the shocking pair of hammers in Zhou Weiqing’s hands, Ming Hua did
                                            not dare to allow her surprise to slow her down. Not daring to wait any
                                            further, she struck the barrier with the spike in her hand. With a flash of
                                            light, the Spatial Shackles started to waver as her blows caused it to
                                            hasten the speed of running out.</p>
                                        <p>However, her worry was unfounded. Zhou Weiqing did not launch an attack,
                                            instead lifting the dual hammers with a grin, a very obnoxious, rascally
                                            grin.</p>
                                        <p>This was also the first time Shangguan Bing'er had seen the pair of Legendary
                                            Dual God Strength Hammers. Her knowledge and insight were not as wide as
                                            Ming Hua, and she did not know power of the hammers, but she was still
                                            impressed by its looks.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua’s eyes narrowed, and a cold light flashed in her eyes. “It’s a
                                            weapon Consolidated from a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll? Can you
                                            tell me how many pieces there are?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged helplessly. “No harm in telling you. I just have the
                                            single one. Are you afraid now?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua drew a deep breath, relaxing just a little… God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls, every single one could be said to be a power that defied
                                            the heavens. Luckily, it wasn’t a set, if not who knows how powerful this
                                            fellow would be in the future. At this moment, she couldn’t help but feel a
                                            deep sense of admiration for her brother. She had always thought that her
                                            talent was no lower than his, but it seems like in terms of vision and
                                            foresight, she could hardly compare to Ming Yu. This rascal in front of her
                                            was no ordinary person indeed.</p>
                                        <p>“I do not have the word ‘fear’ in my dictionary. Even a God Tier
                                            Consolidating Equipment’s power depends on the person using it. You? Humph
                                            humph! …” Ming Hua took a deep breath as she said that. Holding the spike in
                                            her hand to her chest, a brilliant green light shone forth, the glow
                                            gathering around her left hand as a bright red flower appeared in her
                                            hand.</p>
                                        <p>The bright red flower seemed fresh and stunning, with water droplets still
                                            swirling on its petals. It seemed alive in her hands.</p>
                                        <p>“What is that?” Zhou Weiqing stared at it in surprise and confusion, not
                                            understanding what that was about. However, with his powerful senses, he
                                            seemed to feel a sense of danger, as if the red flower in Ming Hua’s hands
                                            was even more dangerous than she was.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua said passively: “Life Attribute Elemental Jewels aren’t able to
                                            Store any offensive Skills. In a way, our Elemental Jewels’ Skills are
                                            absolutely useless in direct combat. However, the world is fair after all.
                                            Each of us Life Attribute Heavenly Jewel Masters, when our Heavenly Jewels
                                            are Awakened, we are each granted a Personal Plant which would protect us.
                                            This is my Personal Plant, its name is the same as mine… Ming Hua… Flower of
                                            the Underworld. This was truly unexpected… You’re only 3-Jeweled, yet you
                                            have impressively managed to force me to use my hidden aces. I have never
                                            lost to an opponent of equal power level…let alone someone who is of lower
                                            cultivation level than I! Today, I shall not lose either!”</p>
