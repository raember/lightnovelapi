                                            would not allow the Dan Dun Battle Team to be behind by two to zero, not
                                            even for strategy’s sake. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing had already fought, and
                                            in his eyes, it was a certain victory for his little brother TianMa in any
                                            one versus one situation.</p>
                                        <p>As for the two versus two fight, naturally that was even more of an assured
                                            victory to him, since he would be participating personally. Although Zhou
                                            Weiqing had given him some surprises when he had fought in the first match,
                                            to TianFeng the overall result could only be a 3 to 1 victory for the Dan
                                            Dun Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as TianMa ascended the stage, with a swooshing sound, a pair of wings
                                            spread behind his back. His wings looked very different from Zhou Weiqing’s,
                                            smaller and thinner, more like a pair of bat wings. The tips of his wings
                                            were sharp, looking to be lined by something like bone spikes, causing the
                                            entire edge of the wing to be extremely sharp.</p>
                                        <p>Looking coldly at Zhou Weiqing who was preparing to walk off the stage,
                                            TianMa said coldly: “If not for the rules of the Tournament not allowing you
                                            to fight again, I would kill you this match.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at him with a warm smile, but his mouth was just as evil
                                            as ever. “I’m so afraid! Come and bite me then? Oh, no, that’s not right,
                                            someone like you should have too many diseases. Later I’ll send you a little
                                            tortoise and you can slowly play with it and bite on it.”</p>
                                        <p>“Bastard!” TianMa was enraged, and in a flash he pounced towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>However, the only thing that met him was a thick layer of Heavenly Energy
                                            blocking him. Shangguan Longyin stood in the distance, his face stern as he
                                            said: “No breaking of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament rules. Heavenly Bow
                                            Battle Team, send your second fighter to the stage.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes, Senior Shangguan.” Zhou Weiqing replied honestly, but as he did so he
                                            still pointed a middle finger towards TianMa before jumping off the stage
                                            lightly.</p>
                                        <p>The brothers TianFeng and TianMa were the representative of the younger
                                            generation in the Blood Red Hell, just like how Shangguan Xue’er and Zhan
                                            LingTian were for the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, or how Tian’er and Gu
                                            Yingbing were for the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Naturally, they had a similar
                                            status as well. From young, they had been cultivating hard, but that also
                                            meant they did not have much worldly experience… how could they have met
                                            such a situation and face such low brow mockery? Instantly, TianMa was
                                            further enraged, but unfortunately for him, Shangguan Longyin was there
                                            blocking him, and he couldn’t lash out no matter how much he wanted to.</p>
                                        <p>Returning to their Rest House, Zhou Weiqing gave a signal to Ma Qun, who gave
                                            a wicked grin. This time, he did not wear his Heavy Armour, just leaping up
                                            onto the stage immediately.</p>
                                        <p>Seated at the side, Yun Li muttered out loud: “I have decided, no matter what
                                            I will not offend you in the future. You are just too evil.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at him innocently: “You can’t blame me for that, who
                                            asked the Dan Dun Empire to act so overbearing in the south. More
                                            importantly, having such connections with the Bai Da Empire? Against
                                            enemies, we can never be merciful, sweeping them away with all our might,
                                            like the autumn wind sweeps away the withered leaves.”</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun’s massive body appeared on the stage once more. For the entire
                                            Heavenly Bow Battle Team, if one were to think about who had the most
                                            appearances on the stage, it would be him and Xixi, who had fought almost
                                            every single round.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Ma Qun ascend the stage, Shangguan Longyin couldn’t help but furrow
                                            his brow. Having placed much importance and attention to the Heavenly Bow
                                            Battle Team, he naturally knew the power of this huge youth in front of him.
                                            Although he had managed to sneakily kill the Bai Da Battle Team Leader, that
                                            did not mean he had the equivalent power. Perhaps this youth had much
                                            potential within him, but at his current state, he could not compare to
                                            TianMa at all.</p>
                                        <p>After releasing his wings, TianMa also revealed his Heavenly Jewels. Seven
                                            sets. Low Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters. Furthermore, with
                                            Shangguan Longyin’s senses, he could naturally tell that this TianMa was
                                            already at the later stages of the seven-Jeweled stage, not too far from
                                            reaching the eight-Jeweled stage. One could imagine his power. Furthermore,
                                            his Physical Jewel was the Agility Type, while his Elemental Jewel was
                                            Alexandrite. That meant, he had at least two Attributes to work with. That
                                            was not even counting the possibility of the Destruction Attribute. With
                                            such an overall power, how could Ma Qun and his four Jeweled cultivation
                                            level face up against him?</p>
                                        <p>However, rules were rules. Since the Heavenly Bow Battle Team had already
                                            sent Ma Qun to fight, Shangguan Longyin could not intervene in a personal
                                            fashion to force them to change their fighter. In a solemn tone, he said:
                                            “Both sides, introduce yourselves.”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun grinned and said casually: “Heavenly Bow Battle Team, Ma Qun.”</p>
                                        <p>TianMa’s cold eyes were filled with the light of bloodlust as he snarled:
                                            “Dan Dun Battle Team, TianMa.”</p>
                                        <p>Just as Shangguan Longyin was about to proclaim the start of the fight, Ma
                                            Qun suddenly lifted a hand in a ‘stop’ gesture. “Senior Shangguan, please
                                            hold on a moment. I have something important to say.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin asked: “Does it have something to do with the
                                            tournament?”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun laughed heartily and said: “Of course, it definitely has a strong
                                            link.”</p>
                                        <p>Only then did Shangguan Longyin nod and say: “Alright then, speak up quickly.
                                            Don’t waste time.”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun bowed respectfully towards Shangguan Longyin and thanked him, before
                                            he turned his gaze to TianMa. He then proceeded in an action that both
                                            Shangguan Longyin and TianMa did not understand - his hands to his hips,
                                            taking a deep breath.</p>
                                        <p>In the next moment, Ma Qun’s voice boomed out from the stage like a machine
                                            gun firing, the volume of his voice was so much that the surrounding battle
                                            team members in their rest houses could all hear it.</p>
                                        <p>“Your name is TianMa right? Why aren’t you called ZhongMa [1. Stud Horse]
                                            instead? Look at you, as tall and beautiful as a jade tree, so handsome and
                                            suave, such a playboy style, everyone would fall for you upon looking at
                                            you, even the flowers would bloom as you walked past… I’m sure you are the
                                            top quality amongst all trash, beasts amongst the beasts. Furthermore,
                                            according to my keen observations, you must have been lacking calcium since
                                            a young age, growing up to look like you lack love, even your grandmother
                                            doesn’t love you, your uncles do not love you. Your left face is asking to
                                            be slapped, your right face asking to be brutally stepped upon. Even a
                                            donkey would feel like kicking you, a pig would feel like stomping on you.
                                            You are born to be like a cucumber, to be beaten! Yet, you have grown up to
                                            be like a walnut, to be ground to dust! Look, look, look, your little face
                                            is so skinny, like a pig! If we threw you into a toilet bowl now, even the
                                            toilet bowl would vomit. If we threw you into a Spatial Rend, the Spatial
                                            Rend would commit suicide and blow up! Siighhh, look and see what you have
                                            done, this Great Young Master wants to teach you to use the knife, but you
                                            just insist on learning the sword, but you don’t learn the sword properly,
                                            instead always using the ‘down sword’[2. 下贱 vs ‘下剑’ homonym pun. The former
                                            is being ‘low’ or degrading, while the other is literally ‘down’ and
                                            ‘sword’]. There are so many styles of your ‘down sword’, yet you insist on
                                            learning the ‘Drunken Sword’ [3. homonym - slang to acting lewdly while
                                            drunk], instead of the ‘Gold Sword’, you learn the ‘Silver Sword’ [4.
                                            homonym - being a slut]! I think you can just learn the ‘Drunken Silver
                                            Sword’[5. I don’t think there’s an exact meaning, he just combined the two
                                            lol]! You could have been a sword saint, or a sword immortal, alas you cried
                                            and insisted on being a ‘sword man’ [6. ‘Little bitch’]! Really… there is no
                                            need for you to do so. Even though your looks are like that, you should live
                                            on with courage! Even so, you do not need to use your buttocks to cover your
                                            face! I wanted to see you speaking, but why did you bury your face in your
                                            buttocks? Oh? I am so sorry, I did not know that is your actual face, then
                                            where are your buttocks? Why are your buttocks so red? Are you a monkey?
                                            Sigh… in truth, living is a waste of air for you, but if you die you are
                                            also wasting earth to bury you, staying at home you are wasting gold for
                                            your family, how how how? You might as well urinate into a pool and drown
                                            yourself in it?”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that entire long sentence, Ma Qun took an abrupt deep breath. He
                                            had rattled it all off without even taking a breath, and his entire face was
                                            now red from lack of oxygen, but he still stuck his chest out in a righteous
                                            look, as if he was a great hero who was speaking the truth of the world,
                                            sacrificing himself to save the citizens from a great evil.</p>
                                        <p>After finishing all of that, he looked towards TianMa and Shangguan Longyin,
                                            who were both staring at him, stunned silly. Bowing towards Shangguan
                                            Longyin, he said: “I surrender.” After which, he turned around in a suave
                                            fashion, walking off the stage.</p>
                                        <p>In Ma Qun’s rapid fire speech earlier, his words had been spewed out at an
                                            unbelievable speech. Since when had TianMa seen anyone speak like that
                                            before? By the time he came to his senses, his entire mind was filled with
                                            the mass of chaotic nonsense that Ma Qun had rattled off.</p>
                                        <p>What was a state attained… scolding without any curse words, this was a true
                                            attainment of state. In this entire rapid fire speech of Ma Qun’s, he
                                            rambled on about so many different things in scolding TianMa, but he had not
                                            uttered a single curse word</p>
                                        <p>“Bas… Bastard!” TianMa did not know how to scold others, truly. From young,
                                            he had grown up in the Great Saint Lands, and in there, who would dare to
                                            scold others? Let alone in front of him? By the time he recovered his
                                            senses, he was in such a rage that he felt like his lungs were about to
                                            burst.</p>
                                        <p>A thick gold-red flames with an astonishingly brilliant hue of purple smashed
                                            crazily towards Ma Qun.</p>
                                        <p>*Puuu*</p>
                                        <p>The thick Heavenly Energy shield appeared once more, forcefully blocking
                                            TianMa’s attack. No matter how powerful TianMa’s Destruction Attribute was,
                                            the gap between Zong Stage and Heavenly King Stage was just too immense, not
                                            something they could cross so easily.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, when Shangguan Longyin blocked this attack, his eyes were twitching
                                            uncontrollably. Even he had the urge to smash Ma Qun with a single palm
                                            himself, let alone the target of the scolding, Ma Qun. Disgusting, that was
                                            just too disgusting. That big fellow had clearly just come up here to tease
                                            TianMa, scolding him before instantly surrendering. No wonder… no wonder
                                            Zhou Weiqing would send a mere four-Jeweled little fellow against TianMa!
                                            Zhou Weiqing ahhh Zhou Weiqing, you are truly shameless to the utmost
                                            degree!</p>
                                        <p>Another *Puuu* sounds, and TianMa vomited out a mouth of fresh blood. His
                                            eyes were bloodshot as his entire body shuddered violently. He pointed
                                            towards the Heavenly Bow Battle Team Rest House, but he could not speak a
                                            single word.</p>
                                        <p>That mouthful of blood was not because of the backlash from Shangguan
                                            Longyin’s blocking of his attack. As the head judge of the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament, Shangguan Longyin would never do such a thing. It was clearly
                                            because he had been just too angered by Ma Qun and Zhou Weiqing!</p>
                                        <p>Back in the Heavenly Bow Battle Team rest house, Crow was staring at Zhou
                                            Weiqing with her jaw agape. “Boss, this… this… you taught Ma Qun that?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood with arms crossed, calm and at ease, as if he was a lofty
                                            presence in the wind. “This is called strategy. Sigh, I also did not wish
                                            for this to happen. Who asked him to be the second to fight? In truth, I was
                                            just doing an experiment, I needed to test if the old saying ‘Angered to
                                            death’ can really be true? Alas, the facts have proved themselves, we have
                                            failed. Look, that fellow didn’t die right?”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er and Xixi were clutching their stomachs, laughing helplessly at the
                                            side. On the other hand, Yun Li was covering his face, as if ashamed to be
                                            seen together with Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>*PENG* Ma Qun had jumped down from the stage, an excited look on his face.
                                            “Ahhhh, that felt good, so good! Boss, you are truly a genius! I will
                                            definitely memorise those words so I can use them in the future! Ahhh! No, I
                                            forgot!”</p>
                                        <p></p>
