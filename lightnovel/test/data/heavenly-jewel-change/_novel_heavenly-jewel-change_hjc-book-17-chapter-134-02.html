                                            they really are. Alright, here is the plan. Wei Feng, bring seven of the
                                            best horses here, as well as nine of those personal guard armour sets we had
                                            previously. We will disguise ourselves as an ordinary patrol from the
                                            Northern Armies and fight with these Wolf Cavalry Units. Even if we lose or
                                            aren’t able to kill all of them, we will not reveal the existence of our
                                            Peerless Battalion or our position.”</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng hesitation for a second, then nodded. Thinking about how Zhou
                                            Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er had faced nine six Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters and greater without losing, he regained some confidence.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng had seen all the changes that the Peerless Battalion had undergone
                                            since Zhou Weiqing had arrived, and towards this young Battalion Commander,
                                            he definitely had respect and approval. He also knew that he had earned that
                                            too, of the entire Battalion. At least, Zhou Weiqing was able to let them
                                            eat their fill, have warm clothing, and even some unexpected profits. More
                                            importantly, Zhou Weiqing had given them something they had never even
                                            dreamed for. A hope. A hope that they would one day leave this godforsaken
                                            place.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Old Wei, you can bring the others to hide around the
                                            trees far off to see how we fight. These few here are my teachers. This
                                            time, they are here to be all of your archery instructors. This is a good
                                            opportunity to witness the godlike archery of these teachers of mine.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing that these few were actually Zhou Weiqing’s teachers, Wei Feng’s look
                                            at them instantly changed. Zhou Weiqing was already so disgustingly
                                            powerful, how could these few be weak?</p>
                                        <p>In a manner of moments, the horses and equipment were sent to them. The
                                            Heavenly Bow Unit members, plus Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er, all
                                            changed into the Sixteenth Regiment Personal Guard armour. Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Shangguan Fei’er mounted their Ghost Demon Horses, while the others mounted
                                            the ordinary warhorses, before all nine of tehm charged down the hill
                                            together, heading towards the plains.</p>
                                        <p>“Master Hua Feng, you direct us.” Zhou Weiqing said to Hua Feng.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng smiled faintly and said: “Just a hundred wolf cavalry troops, that
                                            shouldn’t require much direction. You and Lady Fei’er just take care of our
                                            defense, and deal with any who might actually succeed in closing in on us.
                                            Leave everything else to us.”</p>
                                        <p>Just a few simple sentences, but it displayed the Heavenly Bow Unit’s
                                            absolute confidence. Although they only numbered seven, and their enemies
                                            were the powerful Wolf Cavalry Troops that they had not faced before, but do
                                            not forget that the Heavenly Bow Empire had once depended on these seven to
                                            put fear into the Kalise Empire, even the Bai Da Empire. Previously, Hua
                                            Feng had not told Zhou Weiqing about the unit of Heavenly Jewel Masters that
                                            had been sent to kill them. The leader of that unit was actually a Heavenly
                                            King Jewel Master. From that alone, one could imagine how much importance
                                            the Bai Da Empire had placed upon the Heavenly Bow Unit.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, the Heavenly Bow Unit members might not be strong in terms of
                                            cultivation and personal power, but they had already trained their archery
                                            to an ultimate maximum. When the seven of them were together as one and with
                                            enough distance, they could even have a chance against a nine-Jeweled
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er remained beside Zhou Weiqing. She was extremely curious as
                                            to what sort of abilities or powers these teachers of Zhou Weiqing’s had.
                                            With her cultivation level, she could easily sense that none of them had
                                            Heavenly Energy that even equalled hers, and more so, none of them were
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters, only ordinary Jewel Masters. Yet, she could clearly
                                            sense the respect and admiration Zhou Weiqing had for them.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, far in the distance, a cloud of dust could be seen,
                                            heading in their direction at an extremely high speed.</p>
                                        <p>“So fast!” A glint of surprise flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes. Without
                                            question, that was the wolf cavalry unit. Just from observing the formation
                                            of the dust cloud and the speed it moved, he could tell that these wolf
                                            cavalry were even faster than ordinary Ghost Demon Horses, almost the same
                                            speed as his own single-horned Ghost Demon Horse. Furthermore, when these
                                            wolves were running, they were extreme silent. Although he could already see
                                            the dust cloud ahead, he could not hear anything, unlike the loud hoof
                                            stomps for normal cavalry units.</p>
                                        <p>All of their vision were far superior to any ordinary person, and at this
                                            point, they could see all hundred of the Company of wolf cavalry soldiers
                                            speeding along, about a thousand yards from them.</p>
                                        <p>The war wolf mounts had a greyish black fur, much larger than any ordinary
                                            wolves, about three metres of body length and almost as tall as an ordinary
                                            warhorse. Although they were sitll a distance, they could sense a wildly
                                            ferocious aura from them.</p>
                                        <p>The cavalry soldiers mounted upon the war wolves were dressed in simple
                                            leather armours, and the most striking part of their appearance was the
                                            dual-horned helmet they were wearing. Each of them were rather massive as
                                            well, ferocious looking with a wild look in their eyes. In their hands, they
                                            held a huge, nearly two metre long, cavalry sabre.</p>
                                        <p>The speeding wolf cavalry troops also seemed to adjust their direction the
                                            moment Zhou Weiqing and the others spotted them. Clearly, they had also seen
                                            Zhou Weiqing too. At that point, their speed actually increased, charging
                                            forth towards them.</p>
                                        <p>“Arrow Tower, Cannon[2. In case anyone has forgotten, Arrow Tower is Han Mo,
                                            Cannon is Gao Shen], you two are in charge of offense. Yi Shi, battlefield
                                            support. Rogue, you finish off any leftovers or those trying to escape. Any
                                            that reach within two hundred yards, Shui Cao and Mu En you two take care of
                                            them. I will swap around as necessary.” Hua Feng’s voice rang out lazily as
                                            he swiftly did a quick arrangement. In truth, with their years of
                                            cooperation and fighting together, even if he didn’t give the instructions,
                                            they would not have any problems.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Yamcha was one of the finest warriors of the WanShou Wolfman Tribe, and with
                                            the military deeds and contributions on the battlefield, he had risen to the
                                            position of Company Leader. At this point, he just needed a few more
                                            battlefield merits and he could possibly rank to Vice Battalion
                                            Commander.</p>
                                        <p>The WanShou Empire population was far less than the ZhongTian Empire, but
                                            their entire population was able to fight in the army. This time, Yamcha had
                                            brought his entire Company to sneak into the ZhongTian Empire borders,
                                            hoping to kill a few patrols or scouts.</p>
                                        <p>The food that they had plundered last autumn had been almost finished, and
                                            their wolfman tribe was struggling a little to make ends meet. Although they
                                            were disdainful towards the ZhongTian calvary, those horses were still great
                                            as food. Furthermore, if they managed to kill more enemies, perhaps he might
                                            even be able to become the Vice Battalion Commander.</p>
                                        <p>This was not the first time Yamcha had done something like this. With the
                                            superior speed of their war wolves, they were often able to move in past the
                                            border for a swift guerilla strike and gain. In Yamcha’s eyes, this time
                                            would not be any different.</p>
                                        <p>In the distance, he spotted a small troop of the ZhongTian Empire army,
                                            likely a patrol of cavalry units. Thinking to himself, he cackled: <i>Haha,
                                                they all have horses! This time is going great! Once we grab all those
                                                horses back, it will be enough food for the tribe for several days. </i>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Instantly, Yamcha gave the order and their entire Company veered off and
                                            charged towards the little patrol of ZhongTian soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>Their charge had barely started for a while and all of a sudden, Yamcha had a
                                            sinking feeling in his heart. As wolfmen with the bloodline of wolves, they
                                            all had stronger senses than any ordinary humans, and more so for fine
                                            warriors like him.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, an earsplitting sound rang through the air, and an
                                            arrow came speeding right at his face.</p>
                                        <p>Yamcha was indeed worthy of being one of the finest of the Company Leaders of
                                            the Wolfman Tribe. In such a critical time of danger, he almost
                                            subconsciously lifted up the cavalry sabre in his hands; the thick blade
                                            just barely blocking the arrow.</p>
                                        <p>*Clang* A loud sound as the arrow hit, and Yamcha’s cavalry sabre shook so
                                            hard with the shockwave that his upper body was sent reeling back.</p>
                                        <p><i>Such strength! We’ve met the human Jewel Masters!</i></p>
                                        <p>This was Yamcha’s first judgement. Next, he saw another arrow, glowing with
                                            red light, whiz past him.</p>
                                        <p>Another huge explosion, and a wolfman soldier exploded into flames, thrown
                                            off his war wolf’s back. His reaction was not as fast as Yamcha, and the
                                            front of his leather armour was ripped apart totally, revealing a torn mess
                                            of flesh.</p>
                                        <p>However, this moment also displayed the fine warrior spirits of the WanShou
                                            Wolf Cavalry. The wolfman soldier who had been thrown off his horse flew
                                            towards two other wolfmen cavalry soldiers, but they easily wheeled to the
                                            side, avoiding him without causing any clash. The ones behind those had more
                                            time to react and were able to catch their companion.</p>
                                        <p>“Damnit, those are ZhongTian Jewel Master archers! TuLuLu!” Yamcha shouted
                                            loudly, the cavalry sabre in his hands sweeping up. In that instant, a green
                                            light appeared above both him and the war wolf mount below him, and their
                                            bodies also grew larger.</p>
                                        <p>“TuLuLu!” A similar shout rang out from all the other wolf cavalry
                                            soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>In the WanShou Empire, there were no ordinary Jewel Masters, only Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters. That was to say, they did not have singular Physical Jewel
                                            Masters or Elemental Jewel Masters. It was either ordinary soldiers or
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p>
                                        <p>However, that was not to say that they were lacking any way. The various
                                            tribes of the WanShou Empire all had their own advantages, the power of
                                            their totemic bloodlines. For the wolfman tribe, the incantation to evoke
                                            their bloodline powers was ‘TuLuLu’.</p>
                                        <p>The wolfman tribe bloodline worked on both them and their war wolf mount,
                                            allowing their defense and speed to increase for a time.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, Han Mo and Gao Shen, who had each released one arrow, had
                                            looks of surprise on their faces.</p>
                                        <p>The arrow that Yamcha had blocked was shot by Han Mo, and the one that had
                                            knocked the other cavalry soldier away was naturally Gao Shen’s arrow,
                                            imbued with his Fire Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>Although both sides were around seven hundred yards apart, the two were
                                            extremely clear and confident about how powerful their arrows were. Yet,
                                            their Company Leader had been able to block Han Mo’s arrow so easily, and
                                            although the ordinary wolfman soldier had been struck by Gao Shen’s arrow,
                                            he was still not dead, just heavily injured.</p>
                                        <p>Shouts and cries rang out from the hundred wolf cavalry units, and in flashes
                                            of green light, their war wolf mounts all sped into a sudden burst of speed,
                                            charging ferociously towards them.</p>
                                        <p>“No wonder they are all able to win against ordinary soldiers at a one versus
                                            ten disadvantage. These soldiers of the WanShou Empire are indeed strong and
                                            valiant indeed.” Hua Feng was still with his usual refined, quiet elegance,
                                            but a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er looked on from the side, also extremely shocked inwardly.
                                            However, for her, the surprise was not the strength of the wolf cavalry
                                            troops, but rather Han Mo’s and Gao Shen’s archery.</p>
                                        <p>That was a distance of seven hundred yards! For an ordinary person, trying to
                                            look from such a distance, they would likely only be able to see a tiny
                                            black dot. Furthermore, with the weather in the chill north, the winds were
                                            extremely strong. Yet, even at such a distance and conditions, the arrows
                                            they shot out seemed like they had eyes on them. This was not just any
                                            ordinary master archer. For Zhou Weiqing to describe their archery skills as
                                            godlike was truly not an exaggeration indeed.</p>
