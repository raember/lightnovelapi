                                            before his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Having just been knocked back by the powerful blow, and still reeling from
                                            the shockwave, it was extremely difficult to dodge nimbly. In truth, the
                                            Skill that Xixi had unleashed through her axes had no offensive capabilities
                                            at all, but it was able to lower the temperature dramatically, causing their
                                            blood to freeze momentarily, slowing them down just a little.</p>
                                        <p>A few more last ditch attempts at blocking, but at last the two unfortunate
                                            souls were once again sent off the stage ignominiously. The Heavenly Bow
                                            Battle Team had won with a great disparity of a three to zero score!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing sat in the rest house, greatly satisfied. Nodding to himself, he
                                            said: “Not only is Xixi extremely powerful, she is extremely intelligent and
                                            meticulous in fighting style too! The Stored Skill she chose might not have
                                            any offensive or destructive capabilities, but it is a perfect choice for
                                            her, a great counter against speed or agility type opponents. In the first
                                            place, with her own physical strength, her offense is already sufficiently
                                            strong. As long as she can control her opponent’s speed, at least in the
                                            same level, not many will be able to defeat her.”</p>
                                        <p>Of course, a large part of Zhou Weiqing’s satisfaction was also the
                                            excitement of winning several tens of millions of gold coins.</p>
                                        <p>The audience couldn’t help but stare in silence. Many of them had watched
                                            many years of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, but it could be said that this
                                            pair of Ma Qun and Xixi and their fighting style was truly a fresh sight.
                                            Pure physical strength and a uniquely powerful armour. Yet, the effect was
                                            unbelievably good.</p>
                                        <p>The other Battle Teams in their rest houses also glanced at them
                                            meaningfully. Of course, these Battle Teams who felt they were stronger did
                                            not place much importance on the Heavenly Bow Battle Team. Pure strength
                                            might seem extremely useful in a fight against the same level, but if they
                                            were to face a strength type Heavenly Jewel Master of greater cultivation
                                            level, they wouldn’t be afraid of them. Furthermore, in most others’ eyes,
                                            this was already the greatest ace of the Heavenly Bow Empire. As such,
                                            though they had won the battle seemingly easily, there wasn’t much sensation
                                            caused around.</p>
                                        <p>The rest of the fights all proceeded in a stable and methodical fashion. The
                                            Dan Dun Empire met with the Bai Da Empire in the first round, and the Bai Da
                                            Empire actually surrendered without fighting. It seemed like they were not
                                            even trying to hide the connection between their two Empires any longer. As
                                            for the other fights, most of them were won by the theorized stronger team.
                                            Each of the Empire’s strength were laid out to the world, and it wasn’t so
                                            easy for ‘dark horses’ to appear all the time.</p>
                                        <p>When it was time for the last three fights, Zhou Weiqing stood up from the
                                            rest house, saying: “Let’s go, it’s time collect our winnings.” The results
                                            of each match would be transferred to each betting station at first notice,
                                            and those who had won could go claim their winnings quickly. This was also
                                            to reduce too much crowding after the fight ended for the day.</p>
                                        <p>On the VIP stand, Shangguan Longyin whispered in Shangguan Tianxin’s ears:
                                            “Zhou Weiqing, that little brat, he has won a lot again. This round, he has
                                            won a few tens of millions of gold. He purposely increased the odds by
                                            betting on the Mi Ou Battle Team first, before placing a nine million gold
                                            bet in the last minute.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianxin shook his head helplessly, saying: “That little brat, he
                                            has really gotten a taste for the betting scene huh! You keep watch on this
                                            matter, we can’t let them come here every Heavenly Jewel Tournament and make
                                            off like bandits. Gifting him some money is no problem, but it can’t be too
                                            much.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” Shangguan Longyin agreed. However, his mouth also
                                            twitched in a faint smile, thinking to himself: To dare to come to the
                                            ZhongTian Empire and ‘steal’ money in such an outright fashion, this Zhou
                                            Weiqing is truly the only one.</p>
                                        <p>The team split up and headed to their respective betting stations to collect
                                            their winnings, and they returned to the inn. Of course, not all of their
                                            bets won, perhaps even the majority of the smaller bets they placed losing.
                                            However, Zhou Weiqing’s heavy bet on their own team had paid great
                                            dividends. At final count, they had bet thirty million gold coins and ended
                                            up with more than seventy million, almost reaching eighty million gold. This
                                            was even after the ZhongTian Empire had ‘taxed’ them on their winnings.</p>
                                        <p>All in all, it had been a great day, and the only regret Zhou Weiqing had was
                                            that he still had not been able to see his beloved Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>With lifted spirits from their victory and the earnings in their pocket, the
                                            team had a large meal in their inn before grouping up in Zhou Weiqing’s room
                                            once again. After all, this first day was just the beginning of the entire
                                            tournament.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss… tomorrow our opponents will be the ZhongTian Battle Team… what is the
                                            plan?” Ma Qun asked curiously. Although he was eager to fight, he knew that
                                            they might possibly face the Shangguan Sisters. As such, he dared not
                                            volunteer to fight, as he knew that he could not face up against any of the
                                            Shangguan Sisters.</p>
                                        <p>Towards the incoming fight, Zhou Weiqing was also at a loss. He did not
                                            really know how to face up against the ZhongTian Battle Team. The three
                                            Shangguan Sisters could be said to be the opponents that Zhou Weiqing did
                                            not wish to face most… facing them, how could he actually bear to take
                                            action! Furthermore, without using the Saint Energy, he did not have
                                            absolute confidence in defeating any of them. Of course, he couldn’t
                                            possibly use the powerful Saint Energy to actually injure his own women
                                            right?</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er looked at Zhou Weiqing’s awkward and difficult expression, before
                                            smiling faintly, saying: “Little Fatty, you are far too concerned about the
                                            matter that you have overlooked the simplest things. Have you forgotten that
                                            every group has two Battle Teams that can qualify out of the preliminary
                                            stage right? Why do we definitely need to fight? As long as we can guarantee
                                            our advance to the next stage, everything will be fine. In truth, Yun Li’s
                                            lot drawing might seem tough, but it is quite advantageous to us. By being
                                            in the same group as the ZhongTian Empire, if we both can advance to the
                                            next stage, in the top eight fights we will no longer need to face them. As
                                            for the finals, who knows what would happen then? In any case, don’t you
                                            have confidence in defeating the Dan Dun Battle Team?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing her words, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes lit up instantly. Indeed! He had been
                                            so focused on the fight with the ZhongTian Battle Team, so concerned about
                                            the Shangguan Sisters that he had totally missed the big picture. Why did
                                            they need to fight? As long as they beat the Dan Dun Battle Team, they would
                                            naturally advance together with the ZhongTian Battle Team!</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>This was a huge cave, extending so deep that one could not see the end with
                                            the naked eye. Strangely, there was a massive stalactite hanging from the
                                            roof of the cave, a weird blood-red colour. Below the cave, it was also a
                                            sea of blood red.</p>
                                        <p>The thick scent of blood. The thick liquid that swirled around non-stop. If
                                            one looked with their eyes alone, they would never be able to know how deep
                                            the thick blood-like liquid went. Even the air around here seemed to have a
                                            red tinge to it.</p>
                                        <p>Right in the center of the cave, there was a large, pitch black stone
                                            platform. It was not large at all, only about five metres long, but in the
                                            midst of all the red, the black was especially attention drawing.</p>
                                        <p>Right smack in the center of that platform, there was another strange… black…
                                            consolidating into literally a black hole. The black hole had a diameter of
                                            about a meter, glowing a faint red in its surroundings. If one looked
                                            closely, they would discover the red glow was actually consolidated from the
                                            red in the air.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, right in front of this black hole on the platform, stood a figure.
                                            The figure was dressed in long red robes, with crimson hair. Right above the
                                            demonic looking eyes, in the forehead, it had a red, crystalline jewel
                                            embedded. This person’s features were simple, but there was an unspeakably
                                            strange feel to him, and one could not tell his age from just looks
                                            alone.</p>
                                        <p>However, his eyes were glowing in a faint gold light, and his pupils were
                                            actually a mix of gold and red. Currently, he was staring right at the
                                            strange black hole in front of him, a look of respect on his face.</p>
                                        <p>“My Lord, I sense that I am about to breakthrough. I will never forget how My
                                            Lord has taken care of me and trained me. Also, My Lord, your instructions
                                            have been carried out and should be complete before long.”</p>
                                        <p>he red clad man’s voice was cold, and as he spoke, the red liquid around the
                                            stone platform actually rolled violently, rising to form patches of red
                                            flame… the entire scene was highly suspect, almost demonic.</p>
                                        <p>“En. Very good, FenTian, you have done well. However, I still need much more
                                            blood essence. Once we gain that object, I’ll see if that old fool can still
                                            imprison me. What you need to do now is to gather more blood into this Blood
                                            Grotto.” A sudden voice rang out from the black hole. The voice was sharp,
                                            but one could not tell if it were male or female. However, as the voice rang
                                            out, all the red liquid in the blood grotto seemed to boil, and large
                                            patches of blood flame welled towards the black hole and was swallowed
                                            up.</p>
                                        <p>“Yes, My Lord.” The red clad man once again bowed respectfully to the
                                            waist.</p>
                                        <p>“Hahahaha…” The piercing sound from the black hole suddenly burst out
                                            laughing. “Old Fool Feng Tian, do you really think you can seal me forever?
                                            Once I use your bloodline to destroy your Seal, I’ll see how you still stand
                                            against me. At that time, I will colour this entire continent with
                                            blood.”</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>The second day of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament had begun.</p>
                                        <p>As the chief judge, Shangguan Longyin’s expression was slightly overcast, and
                                            he came glancing over towards the Heavenly Bow Battle Team rest house.</p>
                                        <p>Just last night, he had personally visited the Heavenly Bow Battle Team’s inn
                                            to look for Zhou Weiqing, telling him that he could only bet on their own
                                            Heavenly Bow Battle Team, and not any other teams. Otherwise, the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace would confiscate all their earnings. When Shangguan Longyin
                                            told Zhou Weiqing that news, to his surprise Zhou Weiqing had just agreed
                                            without any protest. Clearly, he had already expected something like this to
                                            happen.</p>
                                        <p>However, the reason why Shangguan Longyin’s expression was so ugly was
                                            because in the first round of matches, the Heavenly Bow Battle Team had
                                            surrendered directly to the ZhongTian Battle Team, not even bothering to
                                            fight.</p>
                                        <p>To any other person, this was something very normal. However, in Shangguan
                                            Longyin’s eyes, this was a totally different thing. That little brat Zhou
                                            Weiqing, he was clearly still trying to act like a pig to eat the tiger! By
                                            surrendering without a fight, those who might have placed some importance on
                                            the Heavenly Bow Battle Team after yesterday’s fight might just dismiss them
                                            again, and at least for a time, the future bets would not be placed on them.
                                            It looks like just a simple warning is not enough for that little fellow,
                                            we’ll have to do some preventive measures.</p>
                                        <p>Thinking up to this point, Shangguan Longyin went to have a simple discussion
                                            with Shangguan Tianxin, and got orders from him that from tomorrow onwards,
                                            no matter who the Heavenly Bow Battle Team faced, they would bet a hundred
                                            million gold coins on them.</p>
                                        <p>No matter how intelligent he was, Zhou Weiqing was after all just a single
                                            youth, how could he win in such a battle of wits against the entire
                                            ZhongTian Empire? In the past, they had let him get away with it, but now
                                            Shangguan Tianxin knew that after this round of surrendering, he could no
                                            longer lose anymore. As such, with the one hundred million gold bet in
                                            advance, and the resulting other bets, one could just imagine the final odds
                                            for the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p>
