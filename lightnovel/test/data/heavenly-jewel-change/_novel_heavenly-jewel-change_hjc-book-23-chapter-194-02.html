                                            with the Bai Da Empire. To everyone’s surprise, although the Dan Dun Empire
                                            had been fighting so violently with the Geritimo Empire, the Bai Da Empire
                                            did not react at all, remaining extremely silent, as if it had nothing to do
                                            with them.</p>
                                        <p>In the end, the war finally ended under the mediation of the ZhongTian
                                            Empire, with the Dan Dun Empire withdrawing some of its forces. However, the
                                            ZhongTian Empire was after all situated very far away, and they could not
                                            really influence this area of the continent too greatly. As such, although
                                            the war finally ended with the Dan Dun Empire stopping its advance and
                                            promising to return half the conquered territories, it had successfully kept
                                            the other half of the conquered territories as its own.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, actually getting the Dan Dun Empire to return the promised half was
                                            not an easy task as well. Although they had agreed to it verbally, it
                                            remained to be seen whether or not they would actually go through with
                                            it.</p>
                                        <p>This casual demonstration of the Dan Dun Empire’s capability in war also rang
                                            many alarm bells for the ZhongTian Empire. This strong Empire situated in
                                            the South which had always stayed out of any wars previously… it seemed like
                                            they would no longer be as quiet and restrained as they used to be. In this
                                            matter, what role did the Blood Red Hell of the Dan Dun Empire play, no one
                                            else could know for sure.</p>
                                        <p>However, it was without question that the Dan Dun Empire’s overall strength
                                            after this major war and invasion could only grow, far beyond the Fei Li and
                                            Bai Da Empire, and perhaps even slightly edging over the Bao Po Empire now.
                                            Although the Passion Valley was also extremely strong, in terms of overall
                                            combat powers, they were not as ferocious as the Blood Red Hell.</p>
                                        <p>The Dan Dun Empire’s greatest advantage was that situated far in the south,
                                            they had no other natural threat. With their backs facing the ocean, they
                                            also had one relatively protected border in that sense. Furthermore, access
                                            to the oceans provided another source of wealth if used properly. After all
                                            these years of peace, their calm and unhurried advancement allowed them to
                                            have perhaps nearly as much wealth as the ZhongTian Empire.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
                                        <p>“What are the Dan Dun trying to do exactly?” Shangguan Tianyue’s brow was
                                            furrowed deeply as he stalked back and forth in the grandhall.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang remained seated in his main seat, his brow also furrowed
                                            as he remained deep in thought.</p>
                                        <p>“Big bro, what are we going to do? To the north, there is that old tiger in
                                            the WanShou Empire, and now in the south the Dan Dun Empire is also starting
                                            to cause trouble. Should we teach them a lesson?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang looked at Shangguan Tianyue calmly before shaking his
                                            head, saying: “How are we going to teach them a less? Unless we make a show
                                            of force with the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, it will be extremely difficult to
                                            do so. All this while, we have neglected the Dan Dun Empire too much! This
                                            time, they have shown their fangs, and only now we have seen the true
                                            strength of the Dan Dun Empire. You and I know very well how strong the
                                            Geritimo Empire is, and to be able to successfully conquer such a vast
                                            territory in such a short time, what does that prove? It can only show the
                                            Dan Dun Empire’s power and combat abilities.”</p>
                                        <p>“All along, we have thought that the Dan Dun Empire and Geritimo Empire at
                                            the south should not pose much threat. After all, although they are able to
                                            advance and grow peacefully, it is also the lack of wars that does not allow
                                            them to have any chance to train their troops in actual battle. In terms of
                                            fighting capabilities, their soldiers should technically be far weaker than
                                            ours. However, it looks like we have greatly underestimated them, and that
                                            is truly a mistake. The combat prowess of the Dan Dun Empire is far above
                                            our original judgement. I believe that has to do with the support of the
                                            Blood Red Hell, only then can such events occur. These few years… the entire
                                            Mainland has truly not been peaceful at all! First, the destruction of the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire, now the invasion of the Geritimo Empire. If this goes
                                            on, even if the WanShou Empire does not attack us, our Human Empires will be
                                            embroiled in chaos and internal fighting. At least, currently it seems like
                                            the Dan Dun Empire has grown to big to be effective… but even so, since most
                                            of our troops are focused on the north, and the Dan Dun Empire already has
                                            an army that numbers more than a million strong, it will be too difficult
                                            for us to move troops over to suppress them.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue also sighed. “Indeed! It is truly too difficult for us to
                                            extend or move our forces. However, can we really just sit back and watch
                                            the Dan Dun Empire create havoc in the south?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue furrowed his brow once more, saying: “If it is just the Dan
                                            Dun Empire, it isn’t a big deal. At the most, we both can personally move
                                            over to take some action. The worrying thing to me now is that it isn’t just
                                            the Dan Dun Empire causing trouble alone. Haven’t you seen something weird
                                            in the current situation? In this matter, the Bai Da Empire was just too
                                            quiet right? They are also direct neighbours to the Dan Dun Empire, and it
                                            should normally be impossible for them to not protest over such a serious
                                            incident. If… the Bai Da Empire and Dan Dun Empire have allied themselves in
                                            an effort… then … the south might truly be in trouble… Do not forget the
                                            ambitions the Bai Da Empire had shown previously with the Kalise
                                            Empire…”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Shangguan Tianyang’s analysis, Shangguan Tianyue’s expression also
                                            changed.</p>
                                        <p>Far off in the south, if the Bai Da Empire and the Dan Dun Empire joined
                                            forces, they would literally be unbeatable in the region. If they were
                                            willing to do so, they could easily invade and crush the dozen or so smaller
                                            Empires around them, and the Geritimo Empire would not pose any threat to
                                            them. Once these two Empires continued expanding, they could possibly start
                                            posing a direct threat to the ZhongTian and Fei Li Empires. Yet, these two
                                            Empires would still need to face their main enemy, the WanShou Empire.
                                            Despite their strengths, facing such a situation where they were pincered
                                            between two groups of powerful enemies, that would truly be a dangerous
                                            situation.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang said solemnly: “Call Third Brother over as well. We need
                                            to prepare for the worst. It looks like we will have to increase our support
                                            for that little fellow Zhou Weiqing. He can be a sharp nail for us, striking
                                            savagely into the south.”</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Fei Li Empire. South Border. The zone where the original Heavenly Bow Empire
                                            was about to begin.</p>
                                        <p>From the Fei Li Empire borders, in the southwest direction slightly more than
                                            a hundred li away, there was a small city, almost a town. This small city
                                            originally belonged to the Heavenly Bow Empire, and its name was the
                                            Crescent City[2. Quite an interesting name (弦月City, or XianYue. Together it
                                            means crescent, but Xian refers to bow or bow string, and Yue refers to
                                            moon, just thought it was poetic for the Heavenly Bow Empire to have such a
                                            city name :D]. The city was not large at all, but its position was extremely
                                            good, with its back towards the Fei Li Empire, rolling hills and mountains
                                            to its right, and to its left was the largest river in the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire which flowed through the entire Empire. As such, it was very well
                                            connected in terms of traffic, and was considered one of the more prosperous
                                            cities in the entire north of the Heavenly Bow Empire. The population of the
                                            city was about two hundred thousand families, numbering slightly more than a
                                            million citizens in total. Although their city area was not large, the
                                            population density was one of the highest in the entire Heavenly Bow Empire,
                                            behind only the capital city Heavenly Bow City, and another important city
                                            to the far west of the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p>
                                        <p>Twenty Li from the Crescent City, in the depths of a forested region.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing led his Peerless Regiment soldiers, silently hiding amongst the
                                            trees as they waited. There were advantages to having a small number. Since
                                            they only had seven hundred men, all of them cavalry soldiers as well, it
                                            had not been a difficult task to sneak past the borders via the Fei Li
                                            Empire and entering the (ex) Heavenly Bow Empire without being
                                            discovered.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Regiment soldiers were all resting on the spot. All of a sudden,
                                            a figure rode in from the distance, heading directly towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss! Oh, uhm, Commander, I have returned.” The person was not tall, but
                                            looked shrewd and capable. He was dressed in commoner’s clothing, and he ran
                                            all the way to Zhou Weiqing before he finally stopped.</p>
                                        <p>“How was it? Kou Rui, what is the situation in the XianYue City?” Zhou
                                            Weiqing asked smilingly.</p>
                                        <p>The one who had arrived before Zhou Weiqing was his old classmates in the Fei
                                            Li Military Academy, Kou Rui. As the Heavenly Bow Empire diplomatic party
                                            arrived in the Fei Li City, Zhou Weiqing had prematurely ended the
                                            three-year promise he had with his classmates, bringing those willing along
                                            with him. His war to revive his Empire was about to begin, and all sorts of
                                            talents were of great importance to him.</p>
                                        <p>Kou Rui had always been adept at intelligence gathering, and he was a great
                                            scout. However, this was still the first time that he had actually been on
                                            an actual scouting mission that wasn’t a lesson, and he couldn’t help but
                                            feel extremely excited.</p>
                                        <p>“Commander, I have investigated the situation in the Crescent City in full
                                            detail. I’m not sure if it is because the Kalise Empire thinks that the Fei
                                            Li Empire would never attack them, or for some other reason, the defenses in
                                            the Crescent City are far weaker than we had even expected. The garrisoned
                                            troops in the city number only three Battalions, three thousand in total.
                                            Furthermore, they usually cycle their rounds for guards, and the normal
                                            number of soldiers guarding the gates and walls would be only a thousand
                                            men. They are all the Kalise Empire soldiers.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, Kou Rui squatted down, grabbing a small twig on the ground
                                            and drawing a simple diagram of the layout of the defenses and the normal
                                            positions of the enemy soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>“According to the information that I heard, the nearest camp or garrison to
                                            the Crescent City is at least a hundred li away, there is an entire Regiment
                                            of soldiers there. However, from the time for them to send news and return,
                                            the fastest possible time they can get here would be four hours. Possibly
                                            more.”</p>
                                        <p>Kou Rui displayed his talents as an outstanding scout, acquiting his duties
                                            with conscientious professionalism. Furthermore, he only provided the
                                            information that he had scouted out in detail, not mixing in any of his own
                                            opinions. That was not the job of a scout.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing thought for a moment, then said: “Alright, very good. Thank you.
                                            Since we have already fully verified the situation, then it is time for us
                                            to take action. Lei Zi.”</p>
                                        <p>“Here.” The First Main Company’s Company Leader Lei Zi appeared swiftly
                                            before Zhou Weiqing. The wild and intractable nature he had when he had
                                            first entered the Peerless Battalion had now vanished. It was not that he
                                            had taken too many blows, but because he truly loved the atmosphere and
                                            environment of the Peerless Regiment. Although the training was tough, their
                                            treatment was also top notch, so much so that he had never even heard of
                                            such a thing. Of course, the greatest attraction was still the Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls and Stored Skills.</p>
                                        <p>More importantly, towards this young Commander of theirs, Zhou Weiqing, he
                                            truly felt a strong sense of respect and heartfelt admiration. Even a
                                            nine-Jeweled stage Heavenly Jewel Master, he was still able to take him
                                            down. Lei Zi knew he would not be able to do such a thing.</p>
                                        <p>In the entire Peerless Regiment, Lei Zi’s power was definitely one of the top
                                            ranked. Not long ago, he had just broken through to the seven-Jeweled stage,
                                            being a Low Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>“Lei Zi, I want you to choose fifty of the strongest brothers with high
                                            cultivation level. Disguise yourselves to enter the Crescent City. When we
                                            launch our attack from outside, your mission is to lead these brothers to
                                            open the city gate.”</p>
                                        <p>“Understood!” Lei Zi was overjoyed. Such an auspicious [2. I suspect a play
                                            on words here, the phrase for auspicious is literally ‘开门红’ or ‘Open door
                                            Red’ It can also mean ‘a good  beginning’] job, he was more than happy to do
                                            so. It was after all just a small city, and with the opponents likely being
                                            only three thousand ordinary soldiers, most likely without even any Jewel
                                            Masters… as a Low Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, he was confident
                                            of completing this mission even alone, let alone with fifty of his strongest
                                            brothers.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glared at him and said: “Do not be too complacent. This is an
                                            extremely important fight, and we cannot afford to make any mistakes. Not
                                            only do I want you to open the gates, I want you to ensure that all fifty
                                            one of you are unharmed. Otherwise, you can wait to be punished by the
                                            military code. If your mission is completed well, once we occupy the city,
                                            any gold we gain from the three thousand soldiers, the bunch of you can get
                                            five percent.”</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi grinned and said: “Heh heh, Boss, do not worry. We are all tough ones
                                            who treasure our lives so much, with these trash from the Kalise Empire, are
                                            they even capable of injuring us?”</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi headed off to prepare, and Tian’er moved beside Zhou Weiqing with
                                            interest. “Little Fatty, how are you planning to invade this city
                                            later?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, looking composed and confident as if he had an
                                            ace up his sleeve. “This commander naturally has my own brilliant
                                            schemes.”</p>
                                        <p>One hour later, when the Peerless Regiment warriors were starting to move
                                            out, Tian’er stared at Zhou Weiqing with her jaw agape as she listened to
                                            him give the order. “This is your so-called brilliant scheme?...”</p>
                                        <p>The order that Zhou Weiqing had given was unbelievably simple. Two words.
                                            “Charge!”[3. It’s two words in mandarin (冲锋)]</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Silly girl, sometimes people over-complicate
                                            things… it is exactly when they start thinking too much that things become
                                            complicated.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
