                                            position first; but as a Fei Li Empire Citizen, he was naturally even
                                            happier with such a win-win situation.</p>
                                        <p>He understood that Zhou Weiqing had revealed too much of his talent today,
                                            and it was just too astounding. As the saying goes, the trees that grow the
                                            highest in the forest will be knocked down first[1. That’s the literal
                                            translation, but I think you all can get the meaning from the words;
                                            basically someone overly talented would attract jealousy], there was always
                                            a bad side to drawing too much attention. He knew that with Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            character, the only reason he would do something like that was because of
                                            Shangguan Bing’er. Alas, if they did not have a strong background, such an
                                            outstanding talent could mean an early demise.</p>
                                        <p>The world had never lacked talents, but those who could survive and grow to
                                            their maximum heights were few and far between.</p>
                                        <p>The thoughts flashed quickly through Lin TianAo’s mind, and he quickly bowed
                                            respectfully towards Shangguan Longyin, saying: “Thank you Senior Shangguan
                                            for taking care of us. Weiqing is severely injured, could you please aid
                                            Shen Little Demon to help her stabilize for a while. We will give him the
                                            Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit juice to hasten his recovery so he can help cure
                                            Miss Shen. Is that alright?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin was old and experienced, and he instantly knew that Lin
                                            TianAo had accepted the olive branch he had extended. Smiling faintly, he
                                            nodded, his favourable impression of this stable young man in front of him
                                            going up a notch.</p>
                                        <p>Pinching Zhou Weiqing’s nose, Lin TianAo poured in the Heavenly Dragon Holy
                                            Fruit juice and forced him to swallow. However, before he could continue
                                            taking action, Shangguan Longyin stepped forward. In truth, he was unable to
                                            do anything to stabilize and further help Shen Little Demon; the Dark Demon
                                            God Lightning’s venom was just too powerful and overbearing - as soon as he
                                            tried to do anything, it would activate. Furthermore, he wanted to get Zhou
                                            Weiqing to owe him a favour.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin stepped forward to Zhou Weiqing before placing both hands
                                            on his body. His hands were suffused with a shimmering white, almost jade
                                            like, colour as he spread his Heavenly Dao Energy around, moving around Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s body. Under the guidance of the Heavenly Dao Energy, the Heavenly
                                            Dragon Holy Fruit juice quickly spread around Zhou Weiqing’s entire body and
                                            infused within.</p>
                                        <p>In the entire process, Shangguan Longyin was secretly shocked. Earlier, on
                                            the tournament stage, he had examined Zhou Weiqing’s injuries, and knew how
                                            heavily injured he was. Yet, at this moment, only a short time had passed,
                                            and now that he was examining Zhou Weiqing’s body, he was surprised to
                                            discover that his meridians were already starting to heal. It was at a speed
                                            that was definitely beyond any normal rate of healing, even for a Zong Stage
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master, perhaps only those who had reached the Heavenly Dao
                                            Stage like him could do so.</p>
                                        <p>Such an amazing talent! Shangguan Longyin marveled to himself. Of course, he
                                            did not reveal anything in his expression, remaining impassive and cool. In
                                            a matter of moments, the Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit juice had circulated
                                            throughout the meridian network of Zhou Weiqing, and a faint fragrance
                                            wafted from his body. A white mist rose out from his body, and his laboured
                                            breathing calmed down.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit was indeed a rare and miraculous treasure, and
                                            in fact, it was an ingredient in some of the God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit only grew in very particular specific
                                            environments. Dragons were very rare in the Boundless Mainland, and they
                                            were usually only found in deep in the mountains. An adult dragon was
                                            comparable to a Heavenly King Jewel Master powerhouse. However, they were
                                            not considered threats to humans as they usually stuck to themselves, and
                                            did not venture into the human world.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, every dragon was considered a treasure trove to humans.
                                            They had the habit of collecting treasure, and it was common for their
                                            habitats to have a huge amount of treasure like gold and gems. That was not
                                            the only thing; the entire body of the dragon was considered a treasure in
                                            itself; their scales were extremely durable and suitable for making scale
                                            armour, dragon blood and ground dragon bones were some of the top quality
                                            Consolidating Equipment materials, while their nucleus core was the top
                                            quality of all Heavenly Nucleus Cores. It could be said their entire body
                                            was treasure to humans!</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit was, as its name suggests, linked to the
                                            habitats of dragons, and could only grow in their habitats. A dragon’s
                                            saliva would drip onto the ground, and after hundreds of years, only then
                                            would the area be suitable for Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruits to grow. They
                                            were considered top quality healing items, and also had a powerful effect of
                                            strengthening physiques. If a normal human drank the juice of the Heavenly
                                            Dragon Holy Fruit, as long as he wasn’t older than thirty years old, just a
                                            single drop would actually be enough to Awaken their personal Power Jewel,
                                            to become a Jewel Master! As for Jewel Masters, it was able to heal almost
                                            all physical wounds.</p>
                                        <p>With the aid of the Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit juice, Zhou Weiqing’s own
                                            amazing regenerative capabilities was brought to full power, and his
                                            meridians knit themselves together at amazing speed. By the time Shangguan
                                            Longyin removed his hands, his Heavenly Energy was fully back in proper
                                            circulation.</p>
                                        <p>Standing beside Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Longyin showed a pondering look,
                                            almost uncertain, and remained silent for a moment.</p>
                                        <p>“Senior Shangguan, Leader will not be able to last long.” It was only when
                                            one of the Dan Dun Battle Team members called out urgently did Shangguan
                                            Longyin break out of his reverie.</p>
                                        <p>He placed a palm softly on Zhou Weiqing’s head, who shuddered, before slowly
                                            opening his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Waking up to see Shangguan Longyin right in front of him, Zhou Weiqing
                                            started. The next instant, he felt the sudden changes in his body.</p>
                                        <p>Although he still hurt from head to toe, it was already much better than the
                                            unbearable agony he was in before he had lost consciousness. At the same
                                            time, he could also feel the energy drawn from the fourteen energy
                                            whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points, constantly re-nourishing his
                                            body as he could sense his meridians mending.</p>
                                        <p>“Thank you Senior for helping me heal.” With Zhou Weiqing’s intelligence, how
                                            he could he not understand what had happened.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin nodded to him, not concealing his approval of the youth in
                                            front of him.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo quickly stepped forward towards Zhou Weiqing, softly telling him
                                            about Shangguan Longyin’s promise. Zhou Weiqing looked at him questioningly,
                                            and seeing Lin TianAo nodding to him, he understood that his companions were
                                            not against him saving Shen Little Demon, and he knew it would only be a
                                            benefit to them all.</p>
                                        <p>“Since Senior has given his guarantee, we have nothing to worry about.
                                            However, I am not confident in my own abilities in saving Miss Shen, after
                                            all this was actually the first time I’ve also used that Skill. Let me
                                            try.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin nodded, saying: “I understand, if even you aren’t able to
                                            save her, then there is no other choice.” As he said that he turned to the
                                            Dan Dun Battle Team members and waved to them.</p>
                                        <p>Although they were full of hate and animosity towards the Fei Li Battle Team,
                                            they did not dare to show any sign of it or delay. After all, this was their
                                            leader’s survival at stake. As such, they quickly carried her in.</p>
                                        <p>The Rest House was just enough for a single team, and it was extremely
                                            crowded now with all of them in it. Looking at Shen Little Demon, pale faced
                                            and shivering while constantly glowing in the three different colours, Zhou
                                            Weiqing couldn’t help but feel a strange sensation in his heart.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, that feeling was not because of Shen Little Demon’s looks, but
                                            because of the Dark Demon God Lightning. Although he had previously said he
                                            would no longer use it without any compelling reason, he was truly thirsting
                                            for its unbelievable power. If he could truly control this amazing
                                            triple-attribute skill, it was without a doubt it would be an extremely
                                            lethal weapon in his arsenal, especially against opponents higher level than
                                            he was.</p>
                                        <p>As he thought about that, he pondered slightly to himself before saying:
                                            “Please place her on the ground.”</p>
                                        <p>The members of the Dan Dun Battle Team quickly laid her down. Although they
                                            did not know how to treat this youth in front of them, who had caused such
                                            an injury to their Leader, Shangguan Longyin was right next to them, and
                                            Zhou Weiqing had also agreed to heal their Leader, and they would naturally
                                            abide by their agreement.</p>
                                        <p>However, Zhou Weiqing’s following actions caused them all to reveal a violent
                                            rage.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing lifted up his right foot, placing it right on Shen Little
                                            Demon’s chest.</p>
                                        <p>“What are you doing?!” Lan Feng was about to charge forward, but was stopped
                                            by a hand from Shangguan Longyin.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin said solemnly: “He let loose that attack from his right
                                            leg. If I am not wrong, only his right leg is able to withstand the power of
                                            it.”</p>
                                        <p>The members of the Dan Dun Battle Team started, halting hesitatingly, but
                                            their eyes still showed their anger and humiliation. No matter what, Shen
                                            Little Demon was still being stepped on by Zhou Weiqing, and the sheer
                                            humiliation and disgrace of it caused their faces to turn red in rage.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, Zhuo Weiqing ignored them all. The only thing in his mind was
                                            currently: <i>35D… stepping on it sure feels soft… and springy!</i></p>
                                        <p>Of course, he was not the rash, impetuous youngling of two years back, and
                                            would never speak such thoughts out loud. Instead, he looked on calmly, the
                                            solemn picture of a gentleman.</p>
                                        <p>Circulating his Heavenly Energy, Zhou Weiqing pressed the sole of his foot
                                            against her heart, infusing his Heavenly Energy into her body.</p>
                                        <p>However, the infusion was met with puzzlement. Although he could sense the
                                            three wildly rampaging energy forces within her body, he was still unable to
                                            draw them out with his powerful right leg.</p>
                                        <p>Inspiration struck. Zhou Weiqing bent down, the Heavenly Jewels around his
                                            wrists appearing swiftly, and he placed his palms down onto her chest.</p>
                                        <p>This time, not only the Dan Dun Battle Team, but even the members of the Fei
                                            Li Battle Team all stared in shock, their eyes wide and jaws open. However,
                                            before anyone could call out to stop him, Shen Little Demon’s circumstance
                                            changed.</p>
                                        <p>Black, grey and blue. The three lights instantly flickered around Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s palm, as the lights around Shen Little Demon were drawn towards
                                            his palms, just like he had Devoured her Heavenly Energy on the tournament
                                            stage.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, he had to unleash the Devour Skill through his palms.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing it take effect on their Leader was the only thing stopping the Dan Dun
                                            Battle Team members from charging forward to stop it. Even so, they clenched
                                            their fists and gritted their teeth. What sort of healing was this? Was he
                                            doing this on purpose to humiliate them?</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was totally enjoying himself. Originally, when he had taken
                                            action, he truly did not have any dirty thoughts; the reason why he chose
                                            the chest area to take action was because that was where the Dark Demon God
                                            Lightning had struck.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, when his hands actually pressed forward and he started Devouring
                                            the Heavenly Energy, the feeling in his palms, soft, yet springy, it was
                                            just amazing. Furthermore, as the three Attribute Heavenly Energy was drawn
                                            into him from her body, it was immediately transformed into his own Heavenly
                                            Energy, giving him a surge of strength. After all, it was originally formed
                                            from his own Heavenly Energy!</p>
