                                            to Zhou Weiqing, and even his tough meridian channels had been damaged in
                                            several areas. Luckily, the large Saint Energy whirlpool had been able to
                                            take care of most of the fire attribute energies earlier, otherwise his body
                                            might have broken down long since.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, as the pair sat down cultivating, Zhou Weiqing’s first priority
                                            was to nurse himself back to health, at the same time circulating the Saint
                                            Energy to recover their strength.</p>
                                        <p>The three Shangguan Sisters also sat down by their side. With the mother
                                            dragon here, unless that rift she spoke about appeared again, they would not
                                            be in any danger in this place.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had the bloodline of the dragons and the Dark Demon God Tiger,
                                            and his regeneration and recovery rate was so strong that it was more than
                                            comparable to the dragon tribes. Very quickly, his meridian channels were
                                            all repaired, and the energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points were
                                            also spinning at maximum speed, drawing in Heavenly Energy and replenishing
                                            his drained self. With the large Saint Energy whirlpool, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            able to gather the scattered Saint Energy in his body, returning it back to
                                            his personal Saint Energy whirlpool.</p>
                                        <p>Although the Saint Energy was undoubtedly strong, against absolute power it
                                            was still not able to overcome it to victory. Just like earlier, the massive
                                            fireball had scattered most of his Saint Energy. Luckily, a lot of it was
                                            still scattered into his body, and one of the unique characteristics of the
                                            Saint Energy was it would protect its user. Currently, with Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            circulation, the silver white Saint Energy began to flow through his body
                                            like the flow of a stream, gathering back at his DanTian as Zhou Weiqing
                                            began to resume calculating his total amount.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since he entered the Lustre Spatial Realm, Zhou Weiqing had Devoured at
                                            least three thousand drops of Saint Energy or so. Those fire dragons made
                                            from Fire Spirits were definitely a great nourishment to his Saint Energy,
                                            but the next two fights also forced him to use a large amount of Saint
                                            Energy. Currently, as he consolidated them together, he realised the
                                            remaining amount was really not much.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, if it was compared to the amount that both he and Tian’er had before
                                            they entered the Lustre Spatial Realm, it was not a small increase. In the
                                            end, Zhou Weiqing found he had around five hundred drops of Saint Energy
                                            left in his DanTian, but in the previous process, a small portion of Saint
                                            Energy had already merged into his Death Acupuncture Point energy
                                            whirlpools, so the benefits he had received was definitely not to be
                                            underestimated.</p>
                                        <p>A heavy Heavenly Energy reverberation raced through his body, and to Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s surprise, his Heavenly Energy cultivation level seemed to have a
                                            decent rise as well, almost on the verge of breaking through once more as
                                            his twenty seventh Death Acupuncture Point seemed to be loosening.</p>
                                        <p>The surprise was because he had just broken through the twenty sixth Death
                                            Acupuncture Point not long ago, perhaps not even ten days ago… yet, he was
                                            now on the verge of breaking through again. That was truly
                                            inconceivable.</p>
                                        <p>It was clear that this was the benefit of the Saint Energy and his Devour
                                            Skill. The Devour Skill had not only helped the large Saint Energy whirlpool
                                            to gain so much Saint Energy, it hd also drawn in a large amount of Heavenly
                                            Energy into his body, greatly increasing his Heavenly Energy cultivation
                                            level. The Saint Energy would in turn help purify the Heavenly Energy and
                                            prevent any side effects from drawing too much Heavenly Energy in such a
                                            short time, able to fully use it to purely increase his strength.</p>
                                        <p>This was just too fast right? While Zhou Weiqing was so pleasantly surprised,
                                            he was also extremely satisfied. The twenty seventh Death Acupuncture Point
                                            was also the last Death Acupuncture Point of the third portion of the
                                            Immortal Deity Technique, and though he would still be at the sixth Jeweled
                                            stage after this last Acupuncture Point, by completing this third stage of
                                            the Immortal Deity Technique, it would still advance his power a whole step
                                            forward. Not only would the speed of regeneration of his Heavenly Energy
                                            increase, his Immortal Deity Shield would also grow greatly in strength.
                                            Overall, this was definitely a good thing.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, it was actually normal that Zhou Weiqing would be about to
                                            breakthrough. The fire dragons formed by the Fire Spirits were of the purest
                                            of Fire Attribute energies. Such a pure Fire Attribute energy was equivalent
                                            to the fire energy in the Dragons’ bodies. More importantly, as Zhou Weiqing
                                            had infused so much Saint Energy into the Devour Skill, it had greatly
                                            improved it, turning all of the fire dragons back into Saint Energy. All of
                                            that Saint Energy had temporarily mixed with his Heavenly Energy, and with
                                            the enrichment, his Heavenly Energy had actually gone through a qualitative
                                            change… and thus breaking through to the next stage was like a canal forming
                                            when water flows[1. Literal translation, basically means success will come
                                            automatically when conditions are ripe].</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing had totally profitted from that previous
                                            misfortune, but it was also the Demonic Attribute’s Devour Skill once again
                                            showing its extraordinary power again.</p>
                                        <p>Just like the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set that Zhou Weiqing had,
                                            the greater one’s cultivation stage, the greater the boost it would
                                            give.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er could naturally sense the changes in Zhou Weiqing’s body immediately.
                                            While she was still pleasantly surprised, Zhou Weiqing had already begun
                                            slowly infusing the Saint Energy into Tian’er’s body, helping her enrich and
                                            improve her body as well.</p>
                                        <p>However, this time both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er felt their cultivation had
                                            gone through some changes. They discovered that with the large Saint Energy
                                            whirlpool’s movement, their own personal small Saint Energy whirlpool was
                                            also affected to spin along, and the five hundred drops of Saint Energy were
                                            no longer divided equally between the two of them, instead forming a full
                                            circulation between all three Saint Energy whirlpools across their bodies.
                                            Not only was it slowly recovering their Saint Energy, but also enriching and
                                            improving their bodies at the same time.</p>
                                        <p>The reason such a situation was happening was simple, the massive gain in
                                            their overall amount of Saint Energy previously.</p>
                                        <p>In the past, when their Saint Energy had broken past the hundred drop stage,
                                            the connection between them and the Saint Energy had changed. This had
                                            happened again when they reached three hundred drops. Previously, the
                                            highest amount of Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing’s body had already gone past
                                            two thousand drops, and it was natural that a similar occurrence had already
                                            happened, though he had not previously noticed it.</p>
                                        <p>At the side, the three Shangguan Sisters could clearly see that both Zhou
                                            Weiqing and Tian’er’s bodies were slowly turning a silver-white colour as
                                            they continued cultivating. The energy in the air was obviously growing
                                            thicker, and the Saint Energy aura that they were giving off gave them all a
                                            comfortable feeling, even the mother dragon was no exception.</p>
                                        <p>The three Shangguan Sisters could sense that this was extremely beneficial to
                                            them as well, and they instantly began their own cultivation at the side as
                                            well. Feeling the aura of the Saint Energy around them, the Heavenly Energy
                                            in their bodies was clearly more energetic and reactive than usual.</p>
                                        <p>The mother dragon looked at Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, her eyes filled with
                                            surprise. Originally, she did not have a lot of hope within her regarding
                                            the success of them reviving her husband.</p>
                                        <p>After all, the difference in power levels was just too huge.</p>
                                        <p>It still had some understanding regarding the Resurrect Skill of the Divine
                                            Heavenly Spirit Tiger. Ordinarily speaking, if the person using the Skill
                                            had a far higher cultivation level than the target, the chances of success
                                            would be much higher, but the reverse was also true. However, Tian’er’s
                                            current cultivation was only at the seven-Jeweled stage, but her husband was
                                            a Heavenly God Tier stage, one far more powerful than ordinary as well. One
                                            could just imagine what the chances of success for the revival would be… but
                                            no matter what, she still hoped to try, even if there was just a slim chance
                                            of success, she was not willing to give up!</p>
                                        <p>However, right at this moment, as she sensed the Saint Energy aura coming
                                            from Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, she suddenly thought back on how Zhou Weiqing
                                            had actually blocked her attack previously. That should never have been
                                            possible for someone of their power level! Slowly, the mother dragon’s heart
                                            began to heat up fervently… perhaps, they would really have a chance to
                                            succeed in reviving her husband! If that power that had killed her husband
                                            could be said to be full of the aura of destruction, then the current aura
                                            that these two youths were giving out was full of the power of creation.</p>
                                        <p>They could succeed, they definitely could! The mother dragon just lay there,
                                            slowly closing her eyes, praying for them.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since her husband had been killed, this was the first time she had
                                            really calmed down. A powerful sense of exhaustion overwhelmed her, and she
                                            actually fell into a deep sleep.</p>
                                        <p>Although her wounds were relatively recovered, the crazy frenzy of her past
                                            weeks had taken a massive toll on the mother dragon’s body as well. She did
                                            not resist the sleep, as it was the best way for any dragon to recover. She
                                            knew that when the time came to revive her husband, it was highly likely
                                            that they would need her help, and the only way she could increase the
                                            chances of success was for herself to recover and be in tip top
                                            condition.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Time passed swiftly, especially when lost in cultivation.</p>
                                        <p>The three Shangguan Sisters had already woken up and returned to cultivation
                                            several times over, each time they only ate and drank a little before
                                            resuming cultivation.</p>
                                        <p>Bathed in the aura of the Saint Energy, their cultivation speed was far
                                            beyond their usual speed, even compared to being in the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace where the concentration of atmospheric energy was far higher. This
                                            was especially so since all three girls had been infused with Saint Energy
                                            by Zhou Weiqing previously, and it worked as a great primer for them,
                                            allowing them to accept the aid of the Saint Energy around them at a greater
                                            rate. This allowed their cultivation to grow at a much faster rate without
                                            sacrificing stability, improving all this time. Such a chance was not easy
                                            to come by for anyone.</p>
                                        <p>As for Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, they had entered a deep, profound mysterious
                                            state, not even needing to eat or drink, totally unknowing of the time
                                            around them.</p>
                                        <p>The silver white Saint Energy traveled to every single corner of their
                                            bodies, enriching them. In the first day of cultivation, Zhou Weiqing had
                                            already broken through the twenty seventh Death Acupuncture Point, bringing
                                            his cultivation stage one higher. However, it had not ended there, and with
                                            the fresh circulation of the Saint Energy, their Saint Energy was actually
                                            increasing continuously at a rapid pace, much faster than their previous
                                            cultivation speed had been. It was only until the total Saint Energy between
                                            the two had reached over a thousand drops that the speed finally slowed
                                            down.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to previously, both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s meridian channels
                                            were now all covered with a layer of faint silver white light. Their bodies
                                            had been improved and reconstructed by the Saint Energy, as if their world
                                            had been turned upside down, and their cultivation levels had improved
                                            greatly as well.</p>
                                        <p>The atmospheric energy in the Lustre Spatial Realm had always been higher
                                            than the outside world; after all this was a place for the dragons to live,
                                            and was also the core area of the Heavenly Jewel Island. It could be said
                                            that the sheer concentration of atmospheric energy in the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Island arose from the Lustre Spatial Realm, and it was through several
                                            powerful formations that drew in the atmospheric energy that the Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm could last until now. As such, as they cultivated here, they
                                            did not have to worry about atmospheric energy running out.</p>
                                        <p>When they had entered the Lustre Spatial Realm, they had brought with them
                                            thirty days worth of food and water in the Spatial Ring that the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace had provided. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er were not
                                            eating or drinking at all, and thus the group of them could easily last a
                                            long time here. Furthermore, since they were all cultivating, during that
                                            process, they would be enriched by the atmospheric energies, and even the
                                            three Shangguan Sisters only needed very little sustenance every day.</p>
