                                            loud commotion from outside. All of a sudden, there was a loud bang as the
                                            dorm room was knocked open, and seven youths entered the room. The dorm was
                                            meant for eight, and with that, all of them were present. To his surprise,
                                            Zhou Weiqing found that he knew one of them, it was that huge fellow Ma Qun
                                            who he had knocked down the other day.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as the seven entered the room, they saw Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan
                                            Bing’er within, especially the sight of Shangguan Bing’er cleaning the
                                            cabinets, the seven of them halted, dumbfounded.</p>
                                        <p>A skinny, short student asked, his jaw agape: “Heavens! I have heard rumours
                                            about the terrifying state of the boy’s dorm being messy and dirty, but this
                                            looks pretty good! This brother over here, is that your girlfriend?”</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Shangguan Bing’er was standing with her back facing them, as such
                                            none of the others saw her unparalleled beauty, and their eyes naturally
                                            fell to Zhou Weiqing who was sitting in a chair. Zhou Weiqing nodded his
                                            head smugly and said: “Yes! Are you guys also staying in this dorm
                                            room?”</p>
                                        <p>The skinny little student nodded and said: “Yes, we all are. Earlier when we
                                            reported, we were assigned to the same room. Bro, you sure have good luck,
                                            and we have all benefited along with you. Come, let’s introduce ourselves,
                                            my name is Kou Rui.”</p>
                                        <p>Since all 7 of them had entered at once, the large room suddenly felt tiny
                                            and squeezy. Zhou Weiqing looked to Shangguan Bing'er and said: “Bing’er,
                                            why don’t you head back first, we can finish up ourselves.”</p>
                                        <p>This time, Shangguan Bing'er did not insist, nodding lightly to him before
                                            turning around. She gave the rest a smile before leaving with the basin.</p>
                                        <p>With that smile, the entire room was instantly silenced. Besides Ma Qun, who
                                            had seen her previously and had some measure of preparation, the other six
                                            were dazed by her sheer beauty. They had never seen such dazzling beauty in
                                            their lives, and instantly they all fell silent. It was only when Zhou
                                            Weiqing gave a few coughs when they finally broke out of their reverie. By
                                            the time they looked at him once more, their gazes were filled with envy and
                                            jealousy.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had chosen one of the lower bunks, and Ma Qun quickly walked
                                            over to take the one above him. Just as he was about to place his luggage in
                                            the bed above, Zhou Weiqing gave him a light kick and said exasperatedly:
                                            “Cheh, go to another bunk. Look at your size and weight, if you stay above
                                            me, what if the whole thing collapses on me.”</p>
                                        <p>The other six were once again stunned. Although they had come in with Ma Qun,
                                            they had kept their distance, after all his size was just too intimidating,
                                            and they had also heard he was a Heavenly Jewel Master. As such, they were a
                                            little afraid of Ma Qun. Who knew that as soon as they had entered the room,
                                            the fellow within would give him a kick.</p>
                                        <p>Just as the six of them thought a fight would break out, something even more
                                            surprising happened.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun said with an ingratiating tone. “Boss, I just wanted to be closer to
                                            you. I shall just take the lower bed on the bunk beside yours then.”</p>
                                        <p>“En, alright.” Zhou Weiqing stood up and stretched lazily before saying:
                                            “Guys, my name is Zhou Weiqing. You all unpack your stuff, I’m heading out
                                            for a stroll.”</p>
                                        <p>To be honest, he was not used to having so many people in his room,
                                            especially now that they were unpacking and keeping their things, causing
                                            the whole place to be in a mess once more.</p>
                                        <p>After Zhou Weiqing left, Kou Rui and the rest looked at Ma Qun with a changed
                                            expression, thinking to themselves. <i>So this fellow just looks good but is
                                                just a weak fella! Such a coward.</i></p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun felt their gazes on him, and he glared at them. “What are you all
                                            looking at? Looking for a fight? Let me remind you guys, in this dorm, Big
                                            Bro Zhou is the boss, and I am the Lao Er[1. Basically he calls Zhou Weiqing
                                            老大 (lao da), or Boss, and himself as 老二 （lao er), or the second in position.
                                            The pun here is that Lao Er is also an euphemism for penis.].
                                            Understand?”</p>
                                        <p>There was a moment of silence, and all six of them burst out laughing.
                                            “Indeed, you are the Lao Er. Hahaha.”</p>
                                        <p>Only then did Ma Qun realise the mistakes in his words, and he stood up with
                                            a gloomy look on his face. The dorm room was a boisterous and noisy scene
                                            indeed.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing strolled around the main school grounds, he saw an endless
                                            stream of freshmen entering the academy to report. His eyes wandered around,
                                            looking for beauties to admire. At the same time, he was evaluating them,
                                            size, cup etc etc, all the while having a nonchalant look on his face. If
                                            not for his rapidly moving eyes, no one would be able to notice
                                            anything.</p>
                                        <p>After watching for a while, Zhou Weiqing was rather disappointed. The number
                                            of females students admitted to this academy was considerably less, and even
                                            fewer were beauties. The best few he saw were above average, but in
                                            comparison to his Bing’er, it was tantamount to the difference between
                                            heaven and earth.</p>
                                        <p>“What are you looking at?” A voice sounded right beside him, giving him a
                                            huge scare. Although he wasn’t particularly paying attention to his
                                            surroundings, having someone approach him so closely without him finding out
                                            was still a huge surprise to him, and his pupils shrank.</p>
                                        <p>As he turned his head around, he realised it was someone familiar - the Fei
                                            Li God General, Ming Yu!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at him, but did not reply.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu continued speaking: “This year’s freshmen are indeed lacking in
                                            girls, that girlfriend of yours is indeed the cream of the crop.” His
                                            observation skills were extremely astute, and he naturally could tell what
                                            Zhou Weiqing had been looking out for.</p>
                                        <p>“Your name is Zhou Weiqing right? Do you know why I was surprised when I saw
                                            your answer the other day?” Ming Yu did not seem to care about Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s attitude towards him, and continued speaking as if talking to
                                            himself.</p>
                                        <p>“Why?” Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but ask, as he was extremely curious about
                                            it as well.</p>
                                        <p>A faint light sparked in Ming Yu’s eyes, and an imposing aura surged forth
                                            from him as he said: “That’s because it was something that happened to me
                                            not long ago. I was in one of the smaller cities at the border on a patrol,
                                            and somehow our enemies got wind of my location. A hundred thousand strong
                                            army from the Wan Shou Empire somehow snuck past and attacked us there, with
                                            about a hundred thousand of our Fei Li Empire citizens forced to the front
                                            as the vanguard. At that time, I only had five thousand of my personal
                                            troops with me.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s interest was sparked and he asked: “So what did you do?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu said: “Pretty much similar to how you answered the question. I
                                            immediately gave the order to shoot and kill. Countless of our own civilians
                                            died under our own hands… but at that time I had no choice. Just like you
                                            said, if I had been softhearted and hesitated a few seconds, it wouldn’t
                                            have just been those civilians who died that day. Alas, many of the teachers
                                            in the academy are armchair strategists, how would they possibly know the
                                            bloodlust and ferocity of the Wan Shou Empire army. Not only did I order
                                            them to shoot to kill indiscriminately, I also ordered all the civilians
                                            within the city and drafted them to dig large holes within the city near the
                                            walls, and line them with sharp spikes. When nightfall came, I led a suicide
                                            squad of a thousand men and snuck out of the city, striking the enemy from
                                            the side. At that time, I wanted to fight to the death then, but I could not
                                            do so or panic would have risen. By the time I managed to fight my way back,
                                            only 47 injured men survived together with me. However, we successfully
                                            burned most of their rations.”</p>
                                        <p>“Angered by my sneak attack, the Wan Shou Empire Army launched a rather
                                            suicidal counterattack on the city walls once again. In the night, it was
                                            much more favourable to us, but even then, we only managed to kill over ten
                                            thousand of them before they broke through the walls. Luckily, what awaited
                                            them was countless of traps and archers sniping them in a fierce city
                                            battle. Finally, I gave the order to ignite all the houses and granaries,
                                            cutting off our own path of retreat, bringing the remaining troops and
                                            civilians to fight together in the city. We fought in the streets for 2 days
                                            and nights, delaying them them best we could. Finally, our reinforcements
                                            arrived, and the Wan Shou Empire Army, which had been starved for 3 days,
                                            were easily destroyed by the reinforcements, with only less than thirty
                                            thousand escaping. With just five thousand troops and a city full of
                                            civilians, we managed to hold and kill seventy thousand enemies. I felt that
                                            I had accomplished a miracle. What do you think?”</p>
                                        <p>While Ming Yu was describing what had happened to him, his voice was passive
                                            and dispassionate, but Zhou Weiqing’s heart was set afire, feeling his blood
                                            boil as if he were there facing the impossible odds as well. Although Ming
                                            Yu did not describe the details, his commands had been very similar on the
                                            whole to what Zhou Weiqing’s answer had been, and in that instant, Zhou
                                            Weiqing felt as if he was in the midst of the bloody fighting.</p>
                                        <p>“Of course, that’s a miracle. With less than a twentieth of the enemies’
                                            armies in a small city without proper fortifications, being able to hold it
                                            for four days and even burning their rations! If that isn’t a miracle, then
                                            what is?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu gave a bitter smile: “Alas, one hundred and eighty thousand of our
                                            loyal Fei Li Empire Citizens gave up their lives in that four days. Even the
                                            remaining 200 soldiers who survived that day called me an executioner.
                                            Amongst them, more than a third have gone crazy, and the civilians who
                                            actually survived that day hate me to their very bones. My career has also
                                            been affected, why do you think I am here instead of the frontlines?” [2. I
                                            re-verified my translation in Chapter 40-2, and realised I made an error
                                            there. Previously, he was called back to the headquarters, not to the front
                                            lines.]</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s keen eyes stared piercingly at Ming Yu. In that instant, the
                                            bad blood he had for Ming Yu disappeared. He knew that Ming Yu had forged
                                            his reputation in blood and sweat, through his own hard work and countless
                                            death defying battles.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu sighed and continued saying: “Many of the upper echelons of the
                                            military command wanted to punish me, even those who spoke on my behalf only
                                            did so because of my previous merits and contributions. How many actually
                                            know me? That day, when I saw your answer, and heard your reply… I knew you
                                            were the same type of person as I am. Alas, you are not of the Fei Li
                                            Empire, if not I would find some way for you to join my command, for us to
                                            fight together.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Even if I’m not a citizen of the Fei Li
                                            Empire, does that mean we can’t fight together? Do not forget that my
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire is an ally of your Fei Li Empire. It’s just that I
                                            haven’t forged the qualifications to fight together with you yet.”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu laughed and said: “Let’s hope that one day you do. The battlefield is
                                            the stage for real men in this day and age.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded silently, turning his head back towards the entrance of
                                            the Academy.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, his eyes lit up, and he said in surprise: “Ehh? That girl is
                                            not bad!”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu followed his gaze, only to see a young lady dressed in white walk
                                            in…</p>
