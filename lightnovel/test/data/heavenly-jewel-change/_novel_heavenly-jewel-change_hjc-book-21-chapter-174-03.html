                                            unstable. Although his cultivation level was very high, there was a severe
                                            shade in his heart regarding Zhou Weiqing. Naturally, that was because of
                                            Tian’er. The one that she truly loved was this mere human, not himself.
                                            Whenever he thought of this, Gu Yingbing’s heart was filled with pain and
                                            rage. He truly itched to tear Zhou Weiqing into shreds, only then would it
                                            assuage the sheer rage in his heart.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, all Gu Yingbing could think of was to defeat Zhou Weiqing as
                                            quickly as possible; to chase him away and allow him to marry Tian’er as
                                            quickly as possible. As long as all of this ended, he could have Tian’er to
                                            himself. It was more important to marry her and be intimate with her first,
                                            he could slowly cultivate her love for him over time.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing, he felt as if that fellow was looking more and more
                                            disagreeable to the eye by the second. He could only hope that this
                                            torturous wait would finally be over.</p>
                                        <p>After more than two hours of waiting, Xue AoTian finally reappeared in the
                                            Grand Hall. As he did so, his previously overcast expression had vanished,
                                            resuming his usual impassive face; as if the previous events had not
                                            happened.</p>
                                        <p>“Lion King, Bro Long, I have already prepared all the Heavenly Beasts for the
                                            first competition. Come, lets go.” As he said that, he headed back out once
                                            more towards the door.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya quickly roused Zhou Weiqing, while the Lion King Gu Site led his
                                            son in following. As for the Tiger King Xue Aoying, he was the first to
                                            follow behind his brother, as the entire group headed towards the depths of
                                            the Heavenly Snow Castle.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian walked at the head of the group, but he moved slowly. From the
                                            back, none of the others could see his face or expression, but even as he
                                            moved at that stately speed in front, this top powerhouse of the world gave
                                            them all a feeling as he could not be overtaken.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Xue AoTian from behind, Long Shiya’s face changed slightly. He
                                            knew that in this life, he would truly never be able to pass this great
                                            mountain or obstacle that was Xue AoTian. All of his hopes could only fall
                                            upon his precious disciple. No matter how powerful a Heavenly Emperor was,
                                            in the end he was still restricted at the Heavenly Emperor stage.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>The group walked for almost fifteen minutes, twisting and turning throughout
                                            the castle before they finally reached a large room. Within the sides of the
                                            room, there were stairs headed down, and Xue AoTian continued leading the
                                            group down. After almost three hundred yards down the spiralling stairs, at
                                            last they reached a strange holed out crypt.</p>
                                        <p>This crypt did not have obvious signs of being man made, almost as if it was
                                            a naturally formed cave of sorts, filled with glowing brilliant ice crystals
                                            around, as well as snowy white Heavenly Cores studding the ceiling,
                                            providing light illuminating the entire area in a strangely dazzling yet
                                            warped sensation. As soon as the group entered, it felt as if they had
                                            entered some strange fantasy world. Without question, this was part of the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain, and one that was deep within the heart of it. It was
                                            also one of the most important sacred areas of the Heavenly Snow Mountain.
                                            Normally, if there were no critical issues or unique circumstances, no one
                                            was allowed to enter this place, let alone outsiders like Long Shiya and
                                            Zhou Weiqing. Even the Lion King Gu Site had never actually entered this
                                            area before.</p>
                                        <p>On the other hand, Gu Yingbing was relatively familiar with this place. It
                                            was the zone where the Heavenly Snow Mountain kept and raised Heavenly
                                            Beasts.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain was very different from other Great Saint Lands.
                                            For the other Great Saint Lands, when they captured Heavenly Beasts, they
                                            would Seal and imprison them in order to let their Jewel Masters Skill Store
                                            from them. Of course, the Heavenly Snow Mountain was very different. The
                                            Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger and Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion were in a
                                            sense also Heavenly Beasts, top level Heavenly Beasts on the same rank as
                                            Dragons. As such, their own presence was of great deterrence and awe to any
                                            Heavenly Beasts. To be able to stay in the Heavenly Snow Mountain was
                                            considered a great honour, utmost honour, to any Heavenly Beast. As such,
                                            these Heavenly Beasts here could only be described as raised or cultivated,
                                            not caught or imprisoned.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, to be able to stay in the Heavenly Snow Mountain, most of these
                                            Heavenly Beasts were of the Ice Attribute. Only then would they be able to
                                            survive in the cruel icy conditions of the peak.</p>
                                        <p>One should not think that the depths of the Heavenly Snow Mountain would be
                                            warmer than the outer regions. On the contrary, the depths were much
                                            colder.</p>
                                        <p>Only the direct bloodline of the Heavenly Snow Mountain would know that deep
                                            in the heart of the mountain there lay an unimaginably huge slab of Ice
                                            Jade. This Ice Jade could not possibly be harvested out, not even a Heavenly
                                            God Tier powerhouse could. This was the true reason why the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain maintained such a low temperature even right in the middle of the
                                            warm climate of the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens.</p>
                                        <p>One of the main reasons why the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers had always
                                            suppressed the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lions was also due to this. The
                                            Elemental Attributes of the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers were Divine,
                                            Spirit and Water, while the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lions were that of
                                            Divine, Spirit and FIre. There was normally no difference in power between
                                            Water and Fire Attribute, but in the Heavenly Snow Mountain… that difference
                                            was clear.</p>
                                        <p>The immense Ice Jade Slab had an impressive supplementary assistance to
                                            cultivation of ice and water Attributes. This was also a huge reason why Xue
                                            AoTian could actually reach the Heavenly God Tier stage. His own talents
                                            were undoubtedly outstanding, but it did not guarantee he could actually
                                            reach such a stage. However, with the aid of that massive Ice Jade Slab, his
                                            cultivation speed was fast enough to reach the Heavenly King Stage before
                                            the age of thirty, slowly allowing him to step by step climb up the paths
                                            towards the Heavenly God Tier.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>The surrounding temperature continued dropping as the group moved along.
                                            Besides Xue AoTian, all the remaining members found that a thin layer mist
                                            had formed around their bodies.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian continued walking down the icy path, his slow measured strides
                                            seeming so casual like that of an ordinary human. As for the Lion King and
                                            Prince, the mist around them was glowing with a faint red, while that around
                                            Long Shiya was a six-coloured glow. After all, Long Shiya had the Water
                                            Attribute as well, and this environment was of no effect to him. In truth,
                                            when one reached the Heavenly Emperor Stage, it was difficult for external
                                            environment to affect them.</p>
                                        <p>As for Zhou Weiqing, the mist surrounding him was extremely strange, grey in
                                            colour, surprising the rest of the party. In fact, he seemed to be totally
                                            fine, in an even more relaxed state that Gu Yingbing.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing did not have the Fire or Water Attributes, one should
                                            never forget what his bloodline contained. The Solidified Dragon Spirit had
                                            given him immunity to fire, but at the same time it had also strengthened
                                            his resistance to cold far beyond that of any ordinary person. Although the
                                            current temperature was at a terrifying low, he still did not feel anything.
                                            In truth, he himself was puzzled about the grey mist around his body.
                                            Strangely, he seemed to sense an evil aura about the icy depths, drawing his
                                            own Demonic Attribute, causing it to automatically come out of his body and
                                            surround him. In such a situation, his own cultivation level was actually
                                            aided. At least for his Demonic Attribute, his power levels was increased by
                                            at least thirty percent.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Tiger King Xue Aoying, a blue mist surrounded his body. Although
                                            he was at the front of the party, his senses were extended out, continuously
                                            keeping watch over Zhou Weiqing. Xue Aoying had watched Tian’er grow up, and
                                            he knew this niece of his too well. For a man to draw the eye of his proud
                                            niece, how could he be ordinary? At least, the current changes around Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s body gave him a strange sensation, almost startling even, and he
                                            began to have some doubts about his original judgement on this entire
                                            competition.</p>
                                        <p>At long last, under the lead of Xue AoTian, the entire group reached a wide
                                            space, almost a thousand square metres, with a height of more than thirty
                                            metres. This was possibly the biggest piece of open space in this icy
                                            caverns. At the side of the of this open cave, there was a dark hole, an
                                            entrance to another pitch black cave. It seemed very deep and quiet, but all
                                            of them could sense several powerful auras deep within. Some cold, some
                                            ferocious, some frenzied. Without question, those were the Heavenly Beasts
                                            Xue AoTian had referred to.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian said solemnly: “The first competition will soon begin. For the
                                            purpose of fairness, besides the last Heavenly Beast, I have prepared a pair
                                            of each of the first type of nine Heavenly Beasts, with each single of the
                                            pair for each competitor. As long as you manage to succeed in overwhelming
                                            one, you can go on to the next one, until one of you actually fails.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said: “What if both of them successfully overwhelms all ten of
                                            your chosen Heavenly Beasts?”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian said proudly: “That is impossible. The last Heavenly Beast… is my
                                            partner.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, Long Shiya couldn’t help but be caught by surprise: “You
                                            mean… it is…”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian nodded towards him and said: “Of course, otherwise, how can I
                                            truly test the true limit of these two? If they can successfully overwhelm
                                            the first nine Heavenly Beasts, then the final judgement will be determined
                                            by my old partner. I am sure my old partner will give a fair judgement, with
                                            its pride, it will never lie. Bro Long, what do you think?”</p>
                                        <p>This time, Long Shiya did not hesitate to nod in agreement, saying: “I
                                            agree.” One could imagine, for a Heavenly Beast to gain the approval of the
                                            Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, even respect and even a slight
                                            fear, one could imagine how powerful this Heavenly Beast was. A power that
                                            even Long Shiya would not doubt its judgement.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Gu Site would not have any objections, and before Xue AoTian could
                                            ask him, he nodded in agreement as well.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian smiled faintly and said: “In that case, let us begin. Both of you,
                                            stand apart at a distance of thirty metres.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing immediately walked forward. Their gazes met
                                            momentarily, and it was as if obvious sparks flew in the air from the
                                            tension.</p>
                                        <p>Although Gu Yingbing had the Fire Attribute, and would be slightly affected
                                            by such intense cold of the environment, he was after all a member of the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain, and he had already grown used to such an
                                            environment. Furthermore, as the saying goes, when the extreme meets, some
                                            good will come of it. In truth, when he cultivated his Fire Attribute
                                            Heavenly Energy in such intense icy conditions, it was also of some
                                            benefit.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Gu Yingbing’s eyes were filled with palpable hate, as if he
                                            wanted to devour Zhou Weiqing. On the other hand, Zhou Weiqing looked calm
                                            and peaceful, and that calm caused Gu Yingbing to rage even more. To him,
                                            Zhou Weiqing was dreaming that he could even beat him!</p>
                                        <p>Abruptly, Xue AoTian clapped his hands.</p>
                                        <p>With that, two huge figures slowly walked out from the side cave. When the
                                            two Heavenly Beasts appeared, both the Tiger and Lion King’s expressions
                                            changed slightly. Although they knew that Xue AoTian would not choose some
                                            weak Heavenly Beasts, they had not expected that just the first one would be
                                            so powerful. After all, both Gu Yingbing and Zhou Weiqing had not reached
                                            the Heavenly King Stage, and such a test seemed just too tough.</p>
