                                            into his Immortal Deity Technique and Death Acupuncture Points, would he be
                                            that far from his next breakthrough? However, that also meant that his
                                            requirement of Saint Energy was going to be far greater.</p>
                                        <p>This entire experience also sparked a thought in Zhou Weiqing. As their
                                            cultivation level grew they drew more Saint Energy, his Heavenly Energy
                                            would also begin to take on more characteristics of the Saint Energy, as
                                            more and more of it was joined fully with him. Perhaps this might not
                                            actually increase his overall cultivation level, but with the same amount of
                                            Heavenly Energy, if it was mixed with some Saint Energy, or at least some
                                            characteristics, it would mean the power of any Skills used would increase
                                            dramatically.</p>
                                        <p>At last, Zhou Weiqing finished his cultivation. Slowly opening his eyes, he
                                            saw Tian’er looking at him with a concerned look.</p>
                                        <p>“How is it?” Tian’er asked.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing beamed as he said: “Success, beyond even my imagination! This
                                            Saint Energy is truly beneficial indeed, I love it so much! With it, my
                                            Immortal Deity Technique can now be cultivated without much danger. I have
                                            broken through the twenty sixth stage. Just one more stage, and I will have
                                            completed the third portion of my Immortal Deity Technique. Although at that
                                            point that will not reach the seventh Jewel yet, my overall power should
                                            still have quite some growth.”</p>
                                        <p>As such, Zhou Weiqing began to describe the entire process of how he broke
                                            through and all the sensations and inspirations he had to Tian’er, not
                                            hiding anything from her. Although Tian’er was not cultivating the same
                                            Immortal Deity Technique, Zhou Weiqing believed that when she broke through,
                                            she would meet with something similar in nature. This was the benefit of the
                                            Saint Energy after all.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er paid full attention to Zhou Weiqing’s descriptions earnestly. This
                                            was yet another benefit for them cultivating together, especially since they
                                            shared the same source of the Saint Energy whirlpool, and they could
                                            exchange their thoughts and inspirations at any time. In this way, their
                                            understanding of the Saint Energy could grow at a much swifter rate.</p>
                                        <p>For the next few days before the Heavenly Jewel Tournament Finals would
                                            begin, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er shut themselves in the room, cultivating all
                                            the time. Perhaps before this, they might not be just as hardworking, but
                                            the miraculous draw and feeling of the Saint Energy was just too attractive,
                                            so much so that they became twice as industrious as before.</p>
                                        <p>Two days later, Tian’er’s Heavenly Energy had also successfully broken
                                            through to the twenty ninth stage. Just like what Zhou Weiqing had expected,
                                            when her Heavenly Energy broke through, a hundred drops of Saint Energy also
                                            infused and merged into her Heavenly Energy. However, for Tian’er, the
                                            effect of the Saint Energy improving and evolving her body was even more
                                            obvious than for Zhou Weiqing. Although both of their cultivation levels
                                            only raised a single stage, their overall powers had an obvious and large
                                            growth.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Heavenly Jewel Island.</p>
                                        <p>Early in the morning, the Heavenly Jewel Island Personnel who were in charge
                                            of receiving the guests were already fully prepared. This time, there were
                                            actually two dark horse teams in the top four teams. Besides the Heavenly
                                            Bow Battle Team, there was also the Hariott Battle Team from the Hariott
                                            Empire.</p>
                                        <p>The Hariott Empire was actually an Empire only slightly bigger than the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire. However, for their team to be able to enter the finals
                                            as one of the top four, it was a totally different notion from the Heavenly
                                            Bow Battle Team. For them, it was truly due to some unbelievable good
                                            luck.</p>
                                        <p>All the way, they did not even meet any truly strong teams. Of course, at the
                                            same time, the Hariott Battle Team was also far stronger than it had ever
                                            been before, and the combination of power, skill and lots of luck had
                                            somehow brought them into the top four… definitely becoming the luckiest
                                            team in the entire tournament. Of the traditional four Great Saint Land
                                            Battle Teams, this time only the ZhongTian and WanShou Battle Teams had
                                            actually entered the finals, a result that had truly come as a surprise to
                                            most. Of course, the reason why this had happened was totally due to the
                                            Heavenly Bow Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>In their entire procession up the Heavenly Jewel Island, Ma Qun’s mouth never
                                            remained idle. Indeed, as a youth who was experiencing such majestic sights
                                            for the first time, how could he not be astonished and amazed. In
                                            comparison, Yun Li was much better off, but the shock in his eyes could not
                                            be hidden. Of course, compared to the others, for Yun Li to ascend to the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island, there was another purpose besides the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament. Naturally, that was to pay a formal visit to Little Miss
                                            Muddle’s Master, the most famous God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master in
                                            the Consolidating Equipment Master world, Xing Tianyi. Only if he could gain
                                            this Master’s approval could he truly be together with Little Miss
                                            Muddle.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Jewel Island was unchanged. Towards this area, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            almost familiar with it already. Led by their guide, they were soon brought
                                            coincidentally to the same location where the previous Fei Li Battle Team
                                            had stayed. Perhaps, this was also purposefully arranged by the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Island.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as they ascended the Heavenly Jewel Island, Zhou Weiqing no longer
                                            had any thoughts of cultivating. By his side, Tian’er could clearly sense
                                            his urgent feelings, clearly focused on a single name: Shangguan
                                            Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>Three years. Three years without meeting, and they would finally meet, how
                                            could Zhou Weiqing not be anxious?</p>
                                        <p>After they had settled down, Zhou Weiqing quickly brought the team to the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island Consolidating Equipment Pavilion. Clearly, this was
                                            the place that the entire team was most interested in.</p>
                                        <p>“Go on in and have a look, as long as there are sufficient funds, you can
                                            just buy whatever you all need. Yun Li, the place you want to go is at the
                                            top level. You know how to get up there?” Zhou Weiqing turned his gaze
                                            towards Yun Li.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li nodded. This time, he had clearly made ample preparation. Little Miss
                                            Muddle had described everything to him so many times, and currently in his
                                            hands he had a plaque from her.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Yun Li who was clearly very nervous, Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily
                                            and said: “Don’t worry, there is nothing to be afraid of. The three Senior
                                            God Consolidating Equipment Masters are all very nice. Your talents are no
                                            lower than anyone, and your feelings are there. You can definitely succeed,
                                            I believe in you. We will cheer for you!”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li nodded. Of course, it was impossible for him not to be nervous at all,
                                            but this was something he had to go through. After waving to the rest, he
                                            stepped forward resolutely, heading towards the top of the Consolidating
                                            Equipment Pavilion.</p>
                                        <p>“You go too.” As they watched Yun Li leave, Tian’er said softly to Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing turned to look at her, an ashamed look on his face. However, he
                                            did not try to hide his thoughts. “Tian’er, I…”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er giggled and said: “What! As if I do not already know about your
                                            playboy ways? Go then, you haven’t seen Bing’er for so long, how can I
                                            possibly stop you? Even if I stop you once, can I stop you forever? Since it
                                            is impossible, why not just let you go directly, lest everyone ends up
                                            uncomfortable. Go on, just remember to return.”</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the sincere smile on Tian’er’s beautiful face, Zhou Weiqing took a
                                            step forward and gave her a big hug. In front of everyone, he kissed her on
                                            her soft red lips before turning around.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing his leaving figure, still feeling the lingering warmth on her lips,
                                            the smile on Tian’er’s face did not disappear, growing richer instead. If
                                            she were to say she wasn’t jealous, that would be impossible, as Tian’er was
                                            extremely clear about the place Shangguan Bing’er held in Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            heart. However, so what if she was jealous? There was nothing she could do
                                            to stop it. However, Tian’er also had her own thoughts, just like he loved
                                            Shangguan Bing’er so much, didn’t that mean he couldn’t leave her as well?
                                            Although sometimes Tian’er might seem casual and careless outwardly, she was
                                            actually very sensitive inside. She could sense that Zhou Weiqing’s feelings
                                            for her were not much lesser than Shangguan Bing’er, and that was
                                            enough.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>As he walked out of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, Zhou Weiqing drew a
                                            deep breath, a light in his eyes. Currently, he did not know how to describe
                                            his feelings. If he did not get to see Bing’er anytime soon, he felt he
                                            would go crazy.</p>
                                        <p><i>Bing’er, Bing’er, where are you!</i></p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing walked out of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, heading
                                            directly for the Heaven’s Expanse Palace at top speed. Without question,
                                            Bing’er should be there, and if they did not allow him to enter, he would
                                            yell outside like the previous time. He did not believe that Bing’er would
                                            not be able to hear him.</p>
                                        <p>Very quickly, he had reached the front of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.
                                            However, before he could enter, he was once again stopped by the guards.</p>
                                        <p>“Halt.”</p>
                                        <p>“I am here to see Shangguan Bing’er.” Zhou Weiqing forcefully suppressed the
                                            urgency in his heart, but his expression was not good.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a low voice rang out. “Do you think you can see her
                                            just because you say you want to? Zhou Weiqing, defeat me first before we
                                            talk about that.” Zhan LingTian’s tall figure stepped out stealthily from
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
                                        <p>Compared to the previous time they had met, Zhan LingTian’s expression was
                                            even uglier, as icy cold as the first time Zhou Weiqing had seen Shangguan
                                            Xue’er.</p>
                                        <p>“Bro Zhan, do not make things difficult for me. I am really not in a good
                                            mood now. I want to see Bing’er.” If it were the normal Zhou Weiqing, he
                                            would definitely not speak in such a stiff manner. However, he was just
                                            yearning for Bing’er too much, to be unable to see his beloved despite being
                                            so close to her. Three years! His feelings and emotions were rather unstable
                                            right now.</p>
                                        <p>Dark gold light flashed all about Zhan LingTian, and his Light-Dark Divine
                                            Spear appeared in his grasp. A strong enmity flashed in his eyes as he said:
                                            “I don’t care what mood you are in now, as if I am in a good mood? Who do
                                            you think you are, you already have Lady Bing’er’s heart, and its not enough
                                            for you? You actually still dare to provoke Fei’er and Xue’er? You should
                                            know my feelings for Xue’er, and I have waited so long for this opportunity.
                                            If you want to see Bing’er, you better defeat me first.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at Zhan LingTian, his aura suddenly surging out
                                            irritably. In his eyes, a faint red flashed, as his entire aura burst forth,
                                            in a brutal and overbearing fashion, causing all the nearby gods to pale in
                                            shock, stepping back subconsciously. Even Zhan LingTian was startled by the
                                            sudden fighting spirit that burst out of Zhou Weiqing, and his face
                                            changed.</p>
                                        <p>They had not met for a few years, and the current Zhou Weiqing was no longer
                                            the Zhou Weiqing of the past. These few years, Zhan LingTian had been
                                            training hard, and his cultivation level had improved. However, it was
                                            without a doubt that Zhou Weiqing’s improvement was far greater.</p>
                                        <p>“In that case, Bro Zhan, don’t blame me for being too hard on you too.” Let
                                            alone Zhan LingTian, if there was a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse in front
                                            of him, Zhou Weiqing would not hesitate to take action. In his heart, there
                                            was a fire burning. Zhan LingTian’s blocking was causing that fire to
                                            erupt.</p>
                                        <p>Thick dark gold light sprang out one after the other around Zhou Weiqing, and
                                            the Dual Legendary Hammers appeared in his hands instantly. As the ‘Hate
                                            Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set appeared around him, in a flash he charged
                                            towards Zhan LingTian without any flourishes. He wanted to end it as quickly
                                            as possibly, and he even released the Dragon-Tiger Transformation. The only
                                            difference was that the usually purple eyes were now bloodshot.</p>
