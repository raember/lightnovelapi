                                            set her mind on something, there was no changing it. Just like her
                                            relationship with Zhou Weiqing. If Shangguan Tianyue insisted on getting in
                                            between them, she would definitely run off and elope with Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing held up one of the golden pearls, utterly fascinated. The pearl
                                            emitted such a gentle aura. It must have come from a clam that was at least
                                            a thousand years old! Such a large pearl didn’t need to be paired with any
                                            other adornments. Just placing it in one’s room would have a vitality
                                            consolidation effect.</p>
                                        <p>However, that wasn’t the reason why Zhou Weiqing was so interested in the
                                            pearl. He distinctly remembered Duan Tianlang telling him once that if he
                                            could find a thousand-year golden pearl he might have a chance to increase
                                            his ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ Legendary Set and allow it to thoroughly catch
                                            up to the level of the Boundless Infinitum Set.</p>
                                        <p>Towards those blueprints of the ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ Legendary Set that
                                            Zhou Weiqing already owned, it was no big deal at all for Duan Tianlang to
                                            create them. However, ever since he had met Zhou Weiqing he had been hard at
                                            work researching how to further improve the ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ Set and
                                            surpass his predecessors. He had mentioned those golden pearls to Zhou
                                            Weiqing only because they were exceedingly rare; Zhou Weiqing had not even
                                            been able to purchase one in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Naturally, he
                                            didn’t expect to find one here.</p>
                                        <p>Well, it was a different continent, after all. Just because it was rare in
                                            Boundless Mainland didn’t mean it would be equally rare on XuanTian
                                            Continent. XuanTian Continent was not as vast as and had fewer resources
                                            than Boundless Mainland, but that actually resulted in its oceanic
                                            development being far superior to that of the Boundless Mainland. Clams
                                            containing golden pearls only existed in the deep ocean. Although they were
                                            still considered treasured objects in on XuanTian Continent, but they were
                                            not one of a kind here as they were on Boundless Mainland.</p>
                                        <p>Er Chun was good at paying attention to the words and mannerisms of others.
                                            One look at Zhou Weiqing’s reactions and he knew this young God Tier
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master was pleased with his gift. In his heart, he
                                            was delighted by the result, hastily saying: “I’ve built up a humble
                                            collection of the last few years. If the Young Master would like, I can
                                            present you with something else later on.”</p>
                                        <p>Belongings were important, but for a Heavenly Jewel Master what could be more
                                            precious than a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll? Furthermore, Er Chun
                                            had his own views. With Zhou Weiqing’s status as a God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master, all he had to do was to join the XuanTian Palace and he’d
                                            certainly obtain an incredibly high position. More importantly, he was still
                                            so young. Within the next hundred years, it was likely that his position
                                            within the XuanTian Palace would not waver. If he could play up to such a
                                            high ‘branch’, why would he care about the current items in his collection?
                                            He’d be able to find ten times, even a hundred times more if he
                                            succeeded!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing carefully placed the golden pearl back into its aloeswood box
                                            and handed it to Shangguan Bing’er. “An outstanding treasure. Er Chun, you
                                            have a good sense. I will overlook what happened today. However, you must
                                            restrain yourself. Understood?”</p>
                                        <p>Er Chun was delighted. Running into a person with a passionate sense of
                                            justice was what he feared most. He’d really be done for then. Since Zhou
                                            Weiqing accepted his gift so easily, it clearly showed he was not that sort
                                            of person. Someone willing to accept gifts was much easier to deal with.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er hugged the aloeswood box close to her. She was ecstatic
                                            about the pair of golden pearls and looked down at the box. But she was
                                            forcing herself to restrain the laughter in her eyes. This Little Fatty was
                                            truly rotten. He was clearly still playing the role of a greedy official.
                                            No. Greedy God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master was more like it. Still,
                                            she would never go against it. This was after all the XuanTian Continent and
                                            what they took off them was the belongings of the XuanTian Continent, so
                                            what of it? They might as well just take it.</p>
                                        <p>Just then, there was another knock at the door. Zhou Weiqing was puzzled.
                                            They had only just arrived in the W’Batu and did not know anyone else, who
                                            could be looking for them?</p>
                                        <p>“Enter,” Zhou Weiqing said passively. Er Chun also looked at the doorway
                                            curiously.</p>
                                        <p>An old man appeared at the door. As soon as he entered, he said with a wide
                                            smile on his face: “My dear Zhou Little Brother, you really had me fooled
                                            there!” It was none other than Grandmaster Guyu from The Pearl.</p>
                                        <p>Guyu’s clan wasn’t in W’Batu City, but was close by. Some members of his clan
                                            had actually participated in the XuanTian Trials today, and because Zhou
                                            Weiqing had gotten rid of those three dandys, a young disciple from his clan
                                            had been given another chance and had made it onto the participation list to
                                            the finals.</p>
                                        <p>Guyu had been deeply remorseful once he learned that Zhou Weiqing was a God
                                            Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, and he had hastened over to express his
                                            goodwill. He knew that he couldn’t be blamed for not thinking about such a
                                            possibility, after all that Zhou Weiqing was just too young. Alas, he
                                            couldn’t help but feel such regret… a God Tier Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master had been released by him like that. If he had only known sooner he
                                            was a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, he would have roped him into
                                            joining his clan, even if he had to tie him up! With a God Tier
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master amongst their ranks, perhaps in time they
                                            might actually have the chance to become another Saint Land! What depressed
                                            him most was the fact that he had been the one to write Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Shangguan Bing’er’s letters of recommendation.</p>
                                        <p>That’s it! No wonder such a beauty as Shangguan Bing’er would fall for such
                                            an ordinary-looking person like Zhou Weiqing: he was a great talent, a God
                                            Tier Consolidating Equipment Master!</p>
                                        <p>Of course, it was too late for regrets now. Since Zhou Weiqing had indicated
                                            he wished to join XuanTian Palace, Guyu didn’t have the guts to try to stop
                                            him. That would only bring a heap of trouble onto his clan. Either way, he
                                            still needed to come here. No matter what, he had to deepen the friendly
                                            relations with this young God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master whose life
                                            he had saved. It would be greatly beneficial to his entire clan.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and stepped forward in a welcoming fashion when he saw it
                                            was Guyu. “So it’s Grandmaster Guyu. Don’t blame me for covering it up.
                                            After all, anything can happen on the open seas. I had to be careful. Don’t
                                            worry, Grandmaster, Weiqing will never forget how you saved my life.”</p>
                                        <p>An unsightly look flitted across Er Chun’s face momentarily when he saw it
                                            was Guyu. His cultivation wasn’t at Guyu’s level, but since he was from
                                            XuanTian Palace, he wasn’t really afraid of him.</p>
                                        <p>Only then did Guyu notice Er Chun was also in the room. He smiled faintly and
                                            said: “Brother Er Chun, you’re here too. You’re doing great things for
                                            XuanTian Palace this time!”</p>
                                        <p>These two were both crafty old foxes. Plus the crafty young fox, Zhou Weiqing
                                            was here too, so just a few simple words between them was already enough to
                                            make their meanings crystal clear. Zhou Weiqing had relieved Guyu’s heart,
                                            while the latter had expressed to Er Chun that he would not interfere with
                                            Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Er Chun smiled. “My dear Guyu, you just mentioned saving Young Master’s life.
                                            What’s the story there?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed. “I was out in the oceans with my humble wife hunting
                                            ocean beasts to obtain Heavenly Cores to make Consolidating Ink. Who knew
                                            that we would actually run into a Terror Sea Dragon and were nearly lost at
                                            sea. Fortunately, we encountered Grandmaster Guyu’s ship The Pearl and made
                                            it out alive. Isn’t that saving our life? In fact, if not for this
                                            experience, I might not have steeled my resolve to actually enter the public
                                            world and approach the XuanTian Palace. A person’s individual strength and
                                            resources are limited. If I want to continue researching how to make these
                                            Legendary Sets, I need a lot of financial backing. I figured that only
                                            XuanTian Palace could provide it.”</p>
                                        <p>“Legendary Sets?” Guyu and Er Chun exclaimed, nearly in unison. Shangguan
                                            Bing’er noticed them both gulp.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled. “I’ve only recently joined the ranks of God Tier
                                            Consolidating Equipment Masters. It’s just that the materials needed to make
                                            Consolidating Ink are far too rare. That’s not good for my cultivation.”</p>
                                        <p>Er Chun recovered himself and quickly put in, “Master, don’t you worry, in
                                            the entire XuanTian Continent, our XuanTian Palace can definitely supply
                                            your needs, and with the best service. A respected God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master such as yourself will not encounter any restrictions.”</p>
                                        <p>Guyu sighed inwardly. It was too late to say anything now. Luckily, Zhou
                                            Weiqing still remembered how he had saved his life. He thought about it and
                                            repressed the urge to beg for the desired Legendary Set. There was plenty of
                                            time for that later. If he got over-eager and asked now, Zhou Weiqing might
                                            not be able to do it even if he was willing, because he had just become a
                                            God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. He would wait until Zhou Weiqing
                                            was settled into XuanTian Palace first. In any case, with the favorable
                                            relations they had, whatever he asked for in the future would be like a
                                            repayment.</p>
                                        <p>Neither of them wanted to be first to leave so they dawdled for a while with
                                            some small talk. They only took their leave when Zhou Weiqing said he had to
                                            cultivate. Er Chun set an appointment with him to leave tomorrow, where he
                                            would personally escort them to XuanTian Palace headquarters in the Heavenly
                                            City, and participate in the annual XuanTian Trials finals.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing didn’t know what method of communication XuanTian Palace used,
                                            but it seemed to be very speedy. Early the next morning when Er Chun met
                                            them he told him that XuanTian Palace had already replied and said that he
                                            must see to Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er’s safety. They also sent
                                            instructions to Lord of W’Batu City, Sang Tan, to suppress word that a God
                                            Tier Consolidating Equipment Master had appeared. He had to keep it a
                                            secret.</p>
                                        <p>A lavish horse carriage was prepared for them. It was wide and spacious,
                                            pulled by eight fine steeds. It had been sent specially for Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Shangguan Bing’er. Including Er Chun, a total of eight XuanTian Palace
                                            members followed them. You could say W’Batu City’s XuanTian Palace had sent
                                            its best and brightest.</p>
                                        <p>After squaring things away with Zhou Weiqing the night before, Er Chun was
                                            more careful about his safety. Whether or not he would benefit by being with
                                            Zhou Weiqing, just by safely escorting a God Tier Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master to the XuanTian Palace headquarters would already be a great
                                            achievement for him.</p>
                                        <p>The carriage was extremely roomy, so much so that there would be no problem
                                            carrying ten people. The interior was upholstered in leather and was
                                            carpeted with soft animal pelts. There was a large bed in an inner
                                            compartment, a chair and table outside that. The table was stocked with
                                            food. This carriage was better than that one he had been in with Hua Feng
                                            from the Heavenly Bow Unit.</p>
                                        <p>Climbing into the carriage, Zhou Weiqing chuckled to Shangguan Bing’er. “Er
                                            Chun knows how to enjoy himself, but it ends up benefiting us instead this
                                            time.”</p>
