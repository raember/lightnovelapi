                                        <p>“First of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Zhou Weiqing. Perhaps
                                            most, if not all, of you will not be familiar with my name. However, I am
                                            sure all of you know another name… the Admiral Zhou of our Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire… who is my Father. In order to protect the rest of the Royal Family,
                                            my old man used his strongest self-sacrificial Sealing abilities to Seal the
                                            entire Palace.”</p>
                                        <p>“Now, Princess Difuya has returned, and I have also returned by her side as
                                            her General. These Kalise bastards have invaded our homeland, and only blood
                                            can wash away that disgrace and humiliation. I am sure you fellow brethren
                                            will have some worries about our power, and as the saying goes, it is best
                                            to see for yourselves. Currently, beyond our walls, you all can see that the
                                            Kalise Empire has sent a full Regiment of soldiers to attack our Crescent
                                            City once more. Now, we will use our actions and absolute power to let you
                                            know that… our Heavenly Bow Empire is back. We will definitely revive our
                                            homeland once more! Our previous official notices have already been posted,
                                            and taxes will be waived for a year. This… right here… shall be the
                                            beginnings of our Empire’s revival. Today, not long from now, the Crescent
                                            City’s name will be inscribed in the history books, and you will soon be
                                            proud to be the citizens of this city!”</p>
                                        <p>With his Heavenly Energy voice transference, Zhou Weiqing’s voice clearly
                                            transmitted to every single one of the citizens’ ears. When he said that he
                                            was Admiral Zhou’s son, the original frightened citizens clearly calmed
                                            down. In the entire Empire, Admiral Zhou could be said to be one of the most
                                            famous… everyone knew him to be the previous great guardian of the previous
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire, and he had fought off the Kalise Empire for decades.
                                            The reputation of Admiral Zhou was extremely high and well respected amongst
                                            all the citizens, and at least now, in their eyes, there was less fear and
                                            some hope rekindled.</p>
                                        <p>“Ma Qun, Crow, move out.” As he said that, Zhou Weiqing’s foot tapped lightly
                                            on the ground, launching him off the city walls. As the citizens cried out
                                            in surprise, he abruptly entered the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state, the
                                            massive pair of wings spreading out behind his back, keeping him aloft in
                                            midair.</p>
                                        <p>This would be their first real fight since their return. As the commander,
                                            how could Zhou Weiqing stay out of this one? With a few flaps of his wings,
                                            he appeared right above the two hundred Heavy Cavalry. Under Ma Qun and
                                            Crow’s command, the two hundred Heavy Cavalry soldiers formed another snake
                                            like formation, moving out slowly as they bore down towards the Kalise
                                            Empire army lines.</p>
                                        <p>Kalise Empire Sixth Regiment. Temporary Headquarters.</p>
                                        <p>“Have you all managed to check who these people are who attacked the Crescent
                                            City?” The Kalise Empire Sixth Regiment Commander Zeng Jian said with a
                                            gloomy and overcast expression on his face.</p>
                                        <p>“Regiment Commander Sir, from the looks of the flag on the city walls, it
                                            looks to be those conquered fools from the Heavenly Bow Empire.”</p>
                                        <p>“They managed to seal the city gates in time, and none of the garrisoned
                                            soldiers guarding the city managed to escape. As such, we currently do not
                                            know their actual numbers. If not for the fact that some of our men who were
                                            supposed to return from the Crescent City did not come back, we might not
                                            have gotten the news of the Crescent City being attacked and occupied until
                                            much later.”</p>
                                        <p>“Trash. What a bunch of trash! Just a mere Crescent City and they weren’t
                                            able to defend it.” Zeng Jian said angrily as he slammed his palm on the
                                            table. As the Commander of the Kalise Empire Sixth Regiment, he had
                                            naturally been part of the original invasion of the Heavenly Bow Empire. In
                                            the Kalise Empire, he had a nickname of ‘Fox’, and was a cunning presence on
                                            the battlefield. On the surface, he might seem like he was in a rage, but in
                                            truth, when he heard his scouts’ reports, he had secretly heaved a sigh of
                                            relief. The thing he was most afraid of was actually that the attacking
                                            force was from the Fei Li Empire. After all, this was still very close to
                                            the Fei Li Empire borders. He did not think just the mere force of a single
                                            Regiment was enough to face off against the Fei Li Empire.</p>
                                        <p>Before they had rushed here to the Crescent City, Zeng Jian had already
                                            dispatched a large number of scouts all around the Fei Li Empire border. It
                                            was exactly because of his worry that the Fei Li Empire had invaded them in
                                            force that he dared not directly launch a counterattack against the Crescent
                                            City. However, from the current looks of things, the Fei Li Empire border
                                            was extremely quiet, with not a sign of any military activity. If it was
                                            just a group of Heavenly Bow Empire survivors who had seized a chance to
                                            launch a surprise attack, even if they had succeeded once, he was not
                                            worried at all. In fact, during the period which the Kalise Empire had
                                            occupied the Heavenly Bow Empire, such a situation had already happened a
                                            few times, though perhaps not to such a degree. Even so, it was just a
                                            matter of surrounding and destroying them, and it would even reap him some
                                            military achievements.</p>
                                        <p>“Report.” A scout ran in front outside, kneeling down on a single knee.</p>
                                        <p>“Yes, speak.” Zeng Jian said coldly.</p>
                                        <p>“Regiment Commander, the Crescent City seems to have some movement. Two
                                            Companies of Heavy Cavalry soldiers have moved out from the city and are
                                            headed towards our camp. Currently, we are not sure what their goal is.”</p>
                                        <p>Even the scout did not think that their opponent would send a mere two
                                            hundred soldiers against them. Wasn’t that tantamount to suicide?</p>
                                        <p>“Heavy Cavalry soldiers?” Zeng Jian started momentarily, a hint of
                                            nervousness on his face. Naturally, heavy cavalry soldiers were beyond any
                                            ordinary soldiers, usually elites who had been chosen and formed with piles
                                            of gold.</p>
                                        <p>“What designation do they hold? Are they from the Fei Li Empire?” Zeng Jian
                                            asked with slight tension.</p>
                                        <p>“No Sir, the designation they display seems to be that of the old Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire.” The reply came.</p>
                                        <p>Zeng Jian gave a cold smirk and said: “Very good, it’s good that they aren’t
                                            from the Fei Li Empire. In that case, it seems like these two hundred
                                            soldiers are here to negotiate? Fools! Would their Father, I, actually be
                                            willing to negotiate? No matter what, let’s ‘eat up’ these two hundred heavy
                                            cavalry soldiers before we do anything else. Heh heh heh, two hundred sets
                                            of heavy cavalry equipment… heh heh.” Pausing a while, he continued: “Send
                                            my orders, I want four of our strongest Heavy Cavalry Companies to move out
                                            against them, with light cavalry Companies flanking the sides as support. I
                                            want to annihilate all two hundred of those enemies with a crushing victory.
                                            Move, let us hold the fort on the side and watch.”</p>
                                        <p>As he gave the order, Zeng Jian led the group of Sixth Regiment officers as
                                            they left their temporary headquarter tent.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers did not advance quickly. Firstly, it was
                                            to conserve energy so that they could burst forth with power later, and also
                                            to hide the capabilities of their mounts. As they grew closer to the enemy
                                            camp, Zhou Weiqing was still floating above them in midair. His heart felt
                                            like it was aflame, burning with righteous rage. It was these Kalise Empire
                                            bastards who had invaded his homeland, and it was time for them to pay in
                                            blood.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, the gates of the Kalise Camp opened wide, and a large
                                            number of soldiers charged out. The first out of the gate were four Heavy
                                            Cavalry Companies, totally four hundred soldiers. Right after them came an
                                            entire Battalion of light cavalry soldiers, charging swiftly to catch up
                                            with their compatriots in a flanking maneuver, as the entire group bore down
                                            upon Zhou Weiqing and his two hundred men.</p>
                                        <p>For a small Empire like the Kalise Empire, for a Regiment Formation to have
                                            four Heavy Cavalry Companies was already considered very good. It could be
                                            said that Zeng Jian had dispatched the strongest of his core elite soldiers
                                            directly, with the goal of minimizing losses. As for Zeng Jian himself, he
                                            led two thousand ordinary infantry soldiers and four Companies of Heavy
                                            Infantry soldiers numbering four hundred, advancing behind the cavalry party
                                            as a backup support to hold the lines.</p>
                                        <p>“Commander, things do not seem right! Look, the opposing Heavy Cavalry
                                            soldiers seem to look very different.” All of a sudden, Zeng Jian’s Vice
                                            Commander at his side said to him quietly.</p>
                                        <p>Since the Vice Commander had already noticed it, Zeng Jian had also seen it
                                            for himself. After all, he was an old hand on the battlefield, and as the
                                            Peerless Heavy Cavalry entered his view, he couldn’t help but draw a deep
                                            cold breath.</p>
                                        <p>On the battlefield, there were just some things that were afraid of being
                                            compared and contrasted. Both sides were Heavy Cavalry soldiers, but just
                                            from outward appearance alone, the four hundred Heavy Cavalry soldiers on
                                            the Kalise side paled in comparison to the Peerless Heavy Cavalry
                                            soldiers!</p>
                                        <p>The simplest comparison would just be in terms of their height. Though both
                                            were Heavy Cavalry soldiers, the mounted Kalise Empire soldiers barely came
                                            up to their enemies’ chest. It had to be known that these were the strongest
                                            elite forces of the Kalise Empire armies, and they were specially chosen for
                                            stature and strength. Seeing those Peerless Regiment warriors mounted upon
                                            Unicorn Heavenly Beasts, looking like demonic warriors or gods, Zeng Jian’s
                                            expression changed. Where had these monsters come from? He had never even
                                            heard of such a force, not even from the Fei Li Empire! These fellows were
                                            at least two metres tall? More so, their armour looked to be just too heavy…
                                            what kind of weight was that?!</p>
                                        <p>Next, Zeng Jian saw Zhou Weiqing flying in the air above the two hundred
                                            enemy soldiers. In this regard, he actually did not pay too much attention.
                                            Although Consolidated Wings were not common, but he had at least heard of
                                            them. After all, any Physical Jewel Masters who found the right
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls could have them for themselves, and they
                                            were not too high quality. However, the reason why they were so rare was
                                            because despite their capabilities of flight, they had no other use.
                                            Furthermore, they took up two ‘slots’ or two entire Jewels worth of
                                            Equipment. Most Physical Jewel Masters, given the choice, would not choose
                                            these as their Consolidated Equipment. As a result, he did not place much
                                            importance on Zhou Weiqing at all.</p>
                                        <p>“Archer Battalion, follow the Heavy Cavalry out. Focus on that fellow in the
                                            skies first, then I want you to cover our Heavy Cavalry.” Zeng Jian
                                            immediately gave the order. Although the enemies only numbered two hundred,
                                            he no longer felt the earlier casual ease, instead feeling an intense
                                            pressure now.</p>
                                        <p>In midair, Zhou Weiqing had the clearest picture of the entire battlefield.
                                            The Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation appeared below his feet, and at the
                                            same time he summoned his Overlord Bow.</p>
                                        <p>“Kill.” A simple word, but it was the order that Zhou Weiqing gave now.
                                            Instantly, the slow advance of the Peerless Heavy Cavalry turned into a full
                                            speed charge. Two hundred men, one line, careened towards the enemy
                                            troops.</p>
                                        <p>When a troop of Heavy Cavalry soldiers charged down upon their enemies on
                                            flat plains, besides enemies of the same level, ordinary soldiers would not
                                            be able to stop them. Seeing the Peerless Heavy Cavalry begin their charge,
                                            the Kalise Sixth Regiment’s four Heavy Cavalry Companies dared not lag
                                            behind. If they just waited there and allowed their enemies to charge, the
                                            difference in speed strength and momentum would cause them to be at an even
                                            greater disadvantage. As such, when one side charged, they also instantly
                                            started their own charge.</p>
                                        <p>Both sides were charging, but the difference was just too obvious. Although
                                            the Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers only numbered two hundred, they were in
                                            a single file formation, and thus their formation line was extremely long.
                                            In terms of aura and pressure, they suppressed their opponents. The Unicorn
                                            Heavenly Beasts’ speeds also far surpassed the ordinary warhorses that their
                                            opponents were mounted on, and at last they showed their true speed. Even
                                            from the distant Crescent City, it looked like this two hundred versus four
                                            hundred was like a group of adults bullying a larger group of kids.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the Kalise Empire Sixth Regiment had not only sent out their Heavy
                                            Cavalry soldiers. The Battalion of light cavalry soldiers did not stay
                                            inactive, swiftly encircling around to the flanks and back of the Peerless
                                            Heavy Cavalry, fully surrounding them in preparation for an all-out attack
                                            when their Heavy Cavalry engaged. Their speed was much faster and they
                                            quickly got into position with their lances at the ready.</p>
                                        <p>“Hahaha, Come on!!” Ma Qun yelled in excitement. He didn't even use his
                                            Consolidated Equipment Assembly Shield Set, as in a mass battle like this,
                                            it wasn’t fully suitable. Led by him, the Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers’
                                            all lifted their weapons.</p>
                                        <p>This time, there was no cloth covering those massive and deadly looking
                                            weaponry. As soon as the weapons were lifted up, the opposing Kalise Empire
                                            Heavy Cavalry soldiers suddenly seemed to slow their charge slightly.</p>
                                        <p></p>
