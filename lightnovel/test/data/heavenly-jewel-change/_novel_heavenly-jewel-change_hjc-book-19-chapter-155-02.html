                                            regarding your issues, come with me quickly.” As he said that, he took
                                            Butler from Batulu’s hands, and instantly, a faint reddish gold light sprang
                                            from his hands to envelop Butler’s body, whose ashen face turned slightly
                                            better.</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing that the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord would receive
                                            them, Batulu felt slightly dizzy, and he fell to his knees with a loud thud,
                                            kowtowing towards the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain several times
                                            before standing up once more, following the Lion Prince to the peak.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Soon, the Lion Prince brought the Wolf King directly to the inner hall of the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain Castle, which was where the main matters of the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain were processed every day. The Heavenly Snow Mountain
                                            Mountain Lord seldom appeared normally, and most of the ordinary internal
                                            matters of the Heavenly Snow Mountain was handled by the Lion Price. As
                                            such, though his cultivation level was nothing compared to most of the
                                            powerhouses in the Heavenly Snow Mountain, due to his rank and status, added
                                            on to the fact that he was the top of his generation, having reached the
                                            eight-Jeweled stage at a young age of thirty one, only a single stage of
                                            Heavenly Energy from breaking through to the Nine-Jeweled stage, he was
                                            definitely not one to be underestimated. After all, his future was bright
                                            indeed, with limitless possibilities… as the main disciple of the Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain Mountain Lord and the possible heir to the WanShou Empire, one
                                            could imagine that as long as no unforeseen circumstances cropped up, he
                                            would definitely breakthrough to the Heavenly King Stage, and perhaps even
                                            the Heavenly Emperor Stage.</p>
                                        <p>“Wolf King, please wait here for a moment, I will request for Master to
                                            receive you.”</p>
                                        <p>“Thank you, Your Highness.” The Wolf King said, overwhelmed with tears of
                                            gratitude. With the Lion Prince’s Divine Healing, Butler had somewhat
                                            stabilized.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion Prince disappeared for a while before returning. Looking at Batulu’s
                                            hopeful gaze, he said: “Master will be out in a while. Later, when Master
                                            asks you any questions, just tell him the truth simply and directly, do not
                                            beat around the bush or exaggerate things. He does not like those who speak
                                            too much.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes.” Batulu quickly agreed. Although the Lion Prince only spoke that few
                                            lines, it was guidance of utmost importance.</p>
                                        <p>Batulu waited for nearly an hour before he suddenly felt as if the entire
                                            atmosphere around him changed in a strange way. Subconsciously, he moved his
                                            gaze where it had been resting upon his son’s face which was twisted in
                                            agony, and he realised that before he knew it, there were two more people in
                                            the hall.</p>
                                        <p>Both were dressed in white, the one on the left a young lady with silvery
                                            white hair cascading down her shoulders to the back. Her brilliant purple
                                            eyes were cold, indifferent, almost apathetic… as if the entire world meant
                                            nothing to her. If one examined those eyes closely, they would feel as if
                                            those seemingly beautiful eyes did not have any light of life within them,
                                            as if they were dead inside, like a zombie.</p>
                                        <p>The young lady was positioned slightly behind the one on the right, who
                                            looked to be a youth about the same age as the Lion Prince. He, too, had a
                                            head full of silver hair, but much shorter, only an inch long. His eyes were
                                            purple as well, a much deeper colour. He was also dressed in clean, snow
                                            white clothes, without any ornaments or decorations. To the Wolf King
                                            Batulu’s surprise, this youth did not seem to have any aura of power about
                                            him, with only his looks similar to the young lady behind him.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion Prince was standing right there, his gaze fixed upon the white clad
                                            young lady. His eyes were slightly dazed, with a complicated look within,
                                            and for a moment, he actually forgot to speak out.</p>
                                        <p>The youth furrowed his brow, glancing at the Lion Prince. There was no
                                            obvious aura or energy, but the Lion Prince seemed to be jolted awake
                                            suddenly, and he said respectfully: “Greetings, Master.”</p>
                                        <p>Batulu was caught by surprise. He had never seen the paramount of the WanShou
                                            Empire, the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord, but he had never in his
                                            wildest dreams imagined that he would look so young. Who would think that
                                            the strongest powerhouse in the world, Xue AoTian, would actually be that
                                            young.</p>
                                        <p>Batulu did not dare hesitate, and with a loud thud, he knelt onto the ground
                                            with both knees, kowtowing down so hard that his head made several thumping
                                            sounds.</p>
                                        <p>“Enough.” The white clad youth said passively. As he said that, he lifted his
                                            hands slightly, and Butler, who was originally lying in Batulu’s arms before
                                            he knelt down, had flown up into the air, before Batulu even had a chance to
                                            react. He did not sense any Heavenly Energy reverberations; it was as if the
                                            surrounding air was gently lifting his son away from him.</p>
                                        <p>In a split second, Butler had arrived before Xue AoTian, his entire body
                                            levitating horizontally above ground, as if he could fly.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian swept his gaze over Butler’s face, before he gave an abrupt soft
                                            curious sound. “Eh, what a strange power.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing those words, the Lion Prince’s gaze finally snapped away from the
                                            white clad young lady, his face full of shock. For his Master to actually be
                                            surprised, what kind of strange power was that? Was it really that strong?
                                            After all, in his eyes, Xue AoTian was invincible and omnipotent!</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian slowly lifted one hand, and Batulu could see that the hand was
                                            transparent, as if carved from a block of ice… not even looking like a human
                                            hand.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian placed his hand on Butler’s head, and instantly, his entire body
                                            turned a brilliant gold colour, as if he had been abruptly injected full of
                                            gold.</p>
                                        <p>Batulu continued kneeling down there, his eyes fixed on the scene
                                            unblinkingly. At the same time, his heart had finally relaxed. Now that the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord was willing to help, what couldn’t he
                                            accomplish?</p>
                                        <p>However, in the next instant, that settled heart leaped to his throat once
                                            more. He actually saw the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord, even
                                            nicknamed as the Old God in the WanShou Empire, actually furrowed his
                                            brow.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion Prince at the side was even more shocked. Xue AoTian had helped heal
                                            others before, and no injury, wound or illness was a match for his boundless
                                            spiritual energy, with just a single look sufficient for him to diagnose
                                            everything easily. Yet, this time, his Master had taken such a long look,
                                            yet seemingly still unable to fully confirm what was the ailment. Such a
                                            situation, it was the first time the Lion Prince had witnessed it. Still, he
                                            dared not interrupt Xue AoTian’s judgement.</p>
                                        <p>The gold light disappeared, and Xue AoTian slowly put down his hand,
                                            murmuring slightly to himself: “How strange. Such a fusion of energies, this
                                            is truly the first time I have seen it. Could it be… the Heavenly Demon
                                            Sect? Even so… hmm… let’s see then.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, his hand extended out once more, this time pressing upon
                                            Butler’s forehead.A strange, faint gold light slowly appeared, seeming to
                                            twist the air all around. At the same time, a tall Heavenly Skill Image
                                            appeared behind Xue AoTian’s back; it was of himself.</p>
                                        <p>If Zhou Weiqing were here, he would definitely be able to recognize that was
                                            the sign of a Heavenly God Tier Skill that was self created, and this was
                                            what his teacher Long Shiya was most skilled at. Of course, it was clear
                                            that this self created Heavenly God Tier Heavenly Skill was somewhat
                                            different from what Long Shiya used.</p>
                                        <p>When the Skill was unleashed, Xue AoTian’’s’ entire body was enveloped in a
                                            layer of faint gold light. Silver hair, gold light, the entire image
                                            combined to frame him in a divine, saintly light that one could not directly
                                            stare at.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian slowly moved his hand back, and a gold speck of light was left
                                            glowing in the middle of Butler’s forehead. The next moment, bright gold
                                            light flashed from Xue AoTian’s eyes, shooting directly into Butler’s
                                            eyes.</p>
                                        <p>The next moment, Butler started to tremble violently, as if in extreme
                                            pain.</p>
                                        <p>Batulu, anxious for his son, couldn’t help but stand up at that. The Lion
                                            Prince glanced at him and said: “Wolf King, hold still. Master has his own
                                            ways.”</p>
                                        <p>Only then did Batulu realise that his actions could be read as mistrust for
                                            Xue TianAo. Even if Xue TianAo wanted to kill Butler, what could he do?
                                            Resisting would only bring ultimate disaster to the entire Wolfman Tribe. He
                                            quickly knelt down, trembling with fear and deference.</p>
                                        <p>“Here it is.” Xue AoTian muttered to himself. All of a sudden, the gold speck
                                            of light in Butler’s forehead glowed brightly, shooting forth a ray of light
                                            into the air, forming a circular image resembling a panel.</p>
                                        <p>Batulu’s eyes widened in shock. Such a miraculous sight, he had never
                                            experienced before.</p>
                                        <p>The eyes of the entire room, even the listless eyes of the beautiful young
                                            lady beside Xue AoTian, were suddenly drawn to the circular image that had
                                            appeared.</p>
                                        <p>The image was hazy at first, but it slowly turned clear… showing a tall
                                            muscular youth who was naked from waist up, his upper body rippling with
                                            nearly perfect muscles.</p>
                                        <p>Behind the youth, there was a hazy looking, purple Heavenly Skill Image, and
                                            he was in the midst of leaping up in midair, his right foot smashing down
                                            like a battle axe. Without doubt, this youth was an image from Butler’s
                                            memory, and it was from his perspective that was being showed to the rest of
                                            the room. The Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord Xue AoTian had created a
                                            Spirit Attribute Skill with his own considerable power to show the image of
                                            what had happened previously.</p>
                                        <p>“Ahhh!” An involuntary cry of shock rang out from the beautiful young lady’s
                                            mouth, and her body started shivering uncontrollably.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian started slightly, his brow furrowed, but he said gently: “Tian’er,
                                            what’’s wrong?”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, that silver haired young lady was Tian’er, who had snuck off from
                                            Zhou Weiqing previously. Naturally, the image that was shown was Zhou
                                            Weiqing, in the midst of using the Dark Demon God Lightning to strike
                                            Butler.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing appear suddenly in the image, how could Tian’er not be
                                            shocked. Subconsciously, she brought her hand to her mouth, but tears
                                            streamed down her cheeks uncontrollably.</p>
                                        <p><i>It’s him, it’s him! My love! He… why is he in the north… how could this
                                            be...</i></p>
                                        <p>The image on the round light screen was indeed the exact scene when Zhou
                                            Weiqing had knocked Butler back.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian’s brow was furrowed, but he ignored his daughter. The image
                                            changed slowly, and under his control, the image resumed back to the
                                            previous scene before playing out once more.</p>
                                        <p>Without knowing when, the Lion Prince’s hands had balled into fists. With his
                                            inteligence, how could he not see that the youth in the image had a unique
                                            connection to Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>He was the fiance that Tian’er had mentioned previously. Xue AoTian only had
                                            a single child, and he had gained this daughter at a rather old age, and he
                                            truly loved her very much. However, according to the rules of the Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain, females were not allowed to inherit the position of the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord. As such, with the condition that the
                                            Lion Prince would swear to give up the position of future King of the
                                            WanShou Empire, leaving the future King to be chosen from the Tigermen Tribe
                                            instead, Xue AoTian had betrothed Tian’er to him. This was an absolute
                                            secret in the WanShou Empire, and only the few of them knew about it.</p>
