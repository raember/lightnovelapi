                                            to walk around the entire mainland without any fear, and no one can do
                                            anything to me. Heh heh heh heh.”</p>
                                        <p>“Shameless!”</p>
                                        <p>“Are you trying to die?”</p>
                                        <p>Both girls cried out angrily. Originally, the lucky fellow Zhou Weiqing who
                                            had been enjoying some ‘sexy times’ between the two suddenly felt a sudden
                                            sharp pain on both sides of his body as the soft sides of his waist
                                            experienced the ultimate move of the ladies, the 180 degree pinch! The next
                                            moment, he had been tossed out, smashing into a large tree in a cross shaped
                                            fashion before slowly sliding down.</p>
                                        <p>“You two are too violent, how can you all treat your future husband like
                                            this? Sigh… My dearest Bing’er is still the best! She will not treat me like
                                            this!”</p>
                                        <p>“Shut up!”</p>
                                        <p>Once again, both girls yelled at him in chorus, causing him to hide behind a
                                            tree in fear, afraid to continue speaking.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch and Tian’er looked at each other, before giving of another
                                            synchronized cold humph, turning their heads to ignore the other.</p>
                                        <p>Eight years ago was the previous Five Great Saint Lands gathering. At that
                                            time, Little Witch had met Tian’er, and both girls had become rivals as they
                                            fought, an enmity growing between them. Although Little Witch was from the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect, which could not compare to the Heavenly Snow Mountain
                                            which Tian’er was from, but Tian’er had been a lot naughtier from a young
                                            age, not cultivating as hard. As such, at that time, both girls had been
                                            pretty much equal in power, fighting each other in an extremely tough fight
                                            to result in a stalemate. That had been the start of a rivalry, an enmity,
                                            ever since. Every time they had met since that time, their eyes would turn
                                            red when their eyes met. [1. This is the literal translation of the latter
                                            half of an idiom (仇人相见，分外眼红) 分外眼红 - which says when foes meet, their eyes
                                            will turn red as they come face to face] Although Tian’er’s cultivation
                                            level had raised by leaps and bounds after being together with Zhou Weiqing
                                            for so long, Little Witch was still not afraid of her.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, in front of Zhou Weiqing, they did not continue their argument any
                                            further. It could be said that currently Zhou Weiqing was their common
                                            balance point, otherwise these two violent girls might actually have a fight
                                            right at that moment, despite the situation they were in.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing walked out from behind the tree, helplessly looking at the two
                                            girls, one black and one white. Smiling bitterly, he said: “You two, if you
                                            continue arguing, I’m going to leave first by myself.”</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch said: “Who wants to argue with her, I’m so gentle, kind and
                                            cute, I wouldn’t argue with some milk cows!”</p>
                                        <p>“I’m a tiger, not a cow. The most noble Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger.”
                                            Tian’er said airily. “I know you are just jealous that your breasts are too
                                            tiny, envying mine… so big sister won’t dispute with you. Anyway, I know
                                            Little Fatty likes them big… right, Little Fatty? Aren’t you very skilled at
                                            estimating dimensions? Tell her, what is my cup size?”</p>
                                        <p>Almost subconsciously, Zhou Weiqing exclaimed: “36E, that is truly
                                            impressive!”</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch glared at him, saying: “Stupid Weiqing, are you joining forces
                                            with her to bully me?!”</p>
                                        <p>Just as the three of them were arguing in a messy entanglement, all of a
                                            sudden, a blinding glare intensified through the canopy of the trees,
                                            causing the entire area to brighten significantly, drawing all their
                                            attentions.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing immediately jumped up into the air, striking the tree trunk
                                            several times for leverage as he flew up into the tree canopy high above.
                                            When he reached the top, he was surprised to see that in the distance, there
                                            was a mass of gold light spreading out throughout the sky.</p>
                                        <p>“What is this?” Zhou Weiqing was extremely curious. Although the gold light
                                            was magnificently beautiful, it did not seem to emanate any energy
                                            waves.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch and Tian’er appeared beside him silently, and Tian’er furrowed
                                            her brow, saying: “That is the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s Summoning Signal
                                            Flare, I have seen it once before. Its light rays are very unique, bright
                                            and easily noticeable, but without any energy signature which will lower the
                                            chances of attracting any Heavenly Beasts attention. They are extremely
                                            expensive to make, and for a Heaven’s Expanse Palace disciple to use it,
                                            there has to be something extremely important. I wonder it could be that
                                            would be so urgent? Could it be that one is being surrounded by our Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain disciples? However, the teleportation has just ended, that
                                            shouldn’t happen so quickly as of yet right.”</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch turned to Zhou Weiqing, saying: “Should we avoid it, or go have
                                            a look and see what is actually going on?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was silent for a moment as he pondered the options, before he
                                            finally said: “If you two can promise to work together, and not drag each
                                            other down, then we can go and have a look. Otherwise, I will turn and run
                                            without hesitation, and you both don’t have to follow me.” As he said that,
                                            he had an uncharacteristic serious face, looking solemnly into the distance
                                            as he refused to look at them.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch sidled closer to Zhou Weiqing, saying in a sweet gentle tone:
                                            “Weiqing, don’t be angry… I won’t argue with her anymore, I’ll listen to
                                            you. I’m not like some others, big breasted bimbos who ignores the general
                                            interest of the group.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er gave a disdainful humph, saying: “I can’t be bothered to argue with
                                            you. Weiqing, I will conceal myself first.” As she said that, she once again
                                            morphed into her Fat Cat form, resuming her usual place in his bosom. The
                                            other Battle Teams did not know that Zhou Weiqing had such a powerhouse like
                                            Tian’er by his side, and keeping herself hidden would undoubtedly give them
                                            the greatest possible advantage along with the surprise factor.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing still had a scowl on his face, as he said: “Alright then, in
                                            that case, let’s go.” After saying that, he made the first move, jumping
                                            back down onto the ground and moving swiftly in the direction of the signal
                                            flare.</p>
                                        <p>As he did so, he continued keeping a close watch on his surroundings, but at
                                            the same time, he was also laughing to himself in his heart. Towards these
                                            two beautiful but deadly ‘Black-White Dual Evil Spirits’[2. This is a direct
                                            translation of a ‘naming’ phrase. The 黑白双煞 was a famous nickname for a pair
                                            of ‘heroes’ in the Chinese Classic, The Water Margin 《水浒传》, Zhang Shun 张顺
                                            and Li Kui 李逵, as two characters so different and contrasting yet seeming
                                            cast from the same coin. Zhang Shun was known as the ‘White Stripe in the
                                            Waves’, famous for his water combat, hence the White in the name, while Li
                                            Kui was known as the Black Whirlwind. Both of them were well known to be
                                            ferocious in battle, hence the ‘evil spirits’. Later on, this phrase would
                                            be ‘stolen’ to be used on any similar pairing, whether aptly, or as a pun.
                                            In this case, this is also the reason of the Title referring to the two
                                            girls], it was clear that he would have to act serious and businesslike to
                                            keep them off guard and listening to him. Perhaps that was the benefit of
                                            acting foolish most of the time. In any case, no matter what happened in the
                                            future, he just needed to get through this Heavenly Jewel Tournament first,
                                            and think about the future… later.</p>
                                        <p>“Someone is coming. A lone person.” Fat Cat’s voice rang softly in their
                                            ears. Although these few days she had not participated in combat, with her
                                            incredible senses as a top ranked Heavenly Beast and just her cultivation
                                            level alone, she was always able to sense any incoming danger before Zhou
                                            Weiqing did, keeping him forewarned. It was not that she didn’t want to take
                                            action, but rather that she wanted to give him every opportunity to take
                                            fights and learn as much as possible. Anytime she deemed an attack was too
                                            much for Zhou Weiqing to take, then she would definitely take action. Of
                                            course, that had only occurred once, which was the time she had blocked
                                            Little Witch’s attack. It could be said that with Fat Cat around, although
                                            Zhou Weiqing was only at a mere three-Jeweled cultivation level, he had a
                                            secret Seven-Jeweled cultivation level ace up his sleeve, a Great Saint
                                            Lands Seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master!</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing Fat Cat’s warning, Little Witch warped into black smoke,
                                            disappearing into thin air. Zhou Weiqing also flash stepped, dodging behind
                                            a large tree instantly to conceal himself for an ambush.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a figure flew in from afar, and Zhou Weiqing could
                                            finally see clearly that the person in question was wearing a light blue
                                            uniform - a member of the ZhongTian Battle Team!</p>
                                        <p>When Fat Cat had warned him that there was only one opponent, Zhou Weiqing
                                            had made the preparations to battle. With Little Witch around, he was
                                            confident that the two of them would be able to handle any of their
                                            opponents in the Tournament. After all, they would be fighting two versus
                                            one, let alone with a hidden Fat Cat as their ace up their sleeves.</p>
                                        <p>The Touch of Darkness intercepted the figure in her path of movement, and in
                                            that instant, a strong black light shone brilliantly around her, enveloping
                                            her and wrapping around her all over.</p>
                                        <p>*Poof**Poof**Poof**Poof* A long series of explosions sounded out, and the
                                            Touch of Darkness was actually only able to cause the swift moving figure to
                                            pause a moment, before being shattered by her powerful Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>The incoming person had an insanely fast reaction. After breaking free from
                                            the Touch of Darkness, she did not continue charging forward, instead the
                                            tip of her foot touching the ground, her entire body spinning to the side,
                                            forcibly changing her own path of movement as she flashed three yards to the
                                            left.</p>
                                        <p>Just in that instant, a black light flashed across where her body would have
                                            been if she had continued down her original path. In the midst of a swirling
                                            black mist, Little Witch appeared once again.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, Little Witch had told Zhou Weiqing that as the daughter of the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect Master, and as the Holy Girl of the Sect, she was not
                                            bound by any Darkness Seals. As such, even if she was found to be using the
                                            Darkness or Demonic Attributes, much like in Zhou Weiqing’s case, the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace would not do anything to her. This was also the
                                            reason why the Heavenly Demon Sect was willing to allow her to come here
                                            personally.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, this strike that Little Witch had been so confident in actually landed
                                            amiss, not even able to force her opponent to defend herself, and she
                                            couldn't help but be startled momentarily.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch could finally see their opponent
                                            clearly. It was a young lady, the only lady member in the entire ZhongTian
                                            Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>On the surface, her physical appearance was very ordinary, but when both Zhou
                                            Weiqing and Little Witch rested their eyes on her hands, the Physical Jewels
                                            around her right wrist, their eyes were filled with intense shock.</p>
                                        <p>The reason was simple. That was because around the young lady’s right wrist…
                                            Twelve Physical Jewels encircled slowly...</p>
                                        <p>Yup, twelve. Twelve Jewels. Zhou Weiqing did a double take as he stared, jaw
                                            agape. Rubbing his eyes furiously, he looked once more before confirming
                                            that his eyes had not been mistaken. The Physical Jewels around her wrist
                                            were neatly lined in pairs, the one on top was the Waxy Jade type, while the
                                            one at the bottom was a Red Jade, both the Pure Colours signifying she was a
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master. The only difference was that each Jewel was slightly
                                            smaller than an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master’s Physical Jewel.</p>
                                        <p>“This is a mutated Physical Jewel, and in this case, a Mutated Duo Physical
                                            Jewel! Such a Mutated Duo Physical Jewel is almost as rare as your six
                                            Attribute Elemental Jewel, and I have never heard of, let alone seen one. I
                                            never expected that the Heaven’s Expanse Palace would have a disciple like
                                            this.”</p>
                                        <p>As Fat Cat’s voice sounded in Zhou Weiqing’s ear, he couldn’t help but put
                                            forth the question: “What is a mutated Physical Jewel?!”</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat said: “In very rare occasions, a Heavenly Jewel Master’s Physical
                                            Jewels are mutated in some way or the other, and in her case, with double
                                            the amount of Physical Jewels, is one of the rarest and most powerful of all
                                            the mutations. That is to say, she has two types of Physical Jewels, each as
                                            powerful as any of our Heavenly Jewel Master Physical Jewels, giving her a
                                            boost of 1.5. For example, you are of the Strength Attribute, and only your
                                            Strength is boosted by your Physical Jewels, but for her, both her
                                            Flexibility and Coordination are boosted. As such, although you can see that
                                            she has twelve Physical Jewels, she is actually at the Six-Jeweled
                                            cultivation level. Even so, her close combat skills must be terrifying, not
                                            something any six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master can compare to. She is truly
                                            a unique close combat or melee type Heavenly Jewel Master. Furthermore, this
                                            type of mutated Physical Jewels are only able to Consolidate the two
                                            Physical Jewels into a single Consolidated Equipment, but each piece is
                                            larger than any ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master’s. This person will not be an
                                            easy foe.”</p>
                                        <p>In the time that Fat Cat and Zhou Weiqing were conversing, Little Witch had
                                            already clashed with this young lady member of the ZhongTian Battle
                                            Team.</p>
                                        <p>Dodging Little Witch’s strike, both ladies’ eyes met in mid air, their
                                            furious gazes clashing. On the next moment, they launched their next attacks
                                            simultaneously.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch warped into black mist, directly heading towards the young lady
                                            in hopes of enveloping her totally, but the young lady in question was
                                            definitely no pushover. Striking both her arms against each other, a strange
                                            metallic clash sounded out, and she did not even attempt to dodge the black
                                            mist that Little Witch had formed, allowing herself to be enveloped
                                            within.</p>
                                        <p></p>
