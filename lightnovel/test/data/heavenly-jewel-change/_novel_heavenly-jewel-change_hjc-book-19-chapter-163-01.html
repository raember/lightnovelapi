                                            would take much time and effort to tame them and train them. As such, the
                                            warriors from the two Tribes would mainly be training as infantry troops for
                                            now. At the same time, in the upcoming battles ahead, the Peerless Battalion
                                            would definitely be targeting Unicorn Cavalry soldiers as their primary
                                            targets, with the main goal to gain as many Unicorn Beasts as possible to
                                            bring them into the Peerless Battalion Cavalry Stables.</p>
                                        <p>Yesterday’s rescue had been at the cost of five hundred war horses, pretty
                                            much the Peerless Battalion’s current stock of mounts. Even up to now, the
                                            First Main Company Leader Lei Zi was still aching at the heart about the
                                            loss.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing believed that the Peerless Battalion was indeed on the right
                                            track, and the most important thing for them now was giving them time to
                                            properly develop and grow. He trusted that in the near future, once the
                                            entire Battalion was equipped fully, and with proper support and logistics,
                                            they would be an unstoppable force on any battlefield.</p>
                                        <p>In just a single day, Zhou Weiqing had arranged everything neatly and in
                                            detail for the Peerless Battalion’s immediate future, with contingent plans
                                            as he knew he would not be able to spend much time with them for a while.
                                            This time, he knew that he would be heading to the Heavenly Snow Mountain
                                            after his training, and it would be a do or die event. When, and if, he
                                            returned, it would be the time for the Peerless Battalion to leave the
                                            northern borders and head towards the Heavenly Bow Empire. There, both Zhou
                                            Weiqing and his Peerless Battalion would face their real challenge.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Night descended. As autumn deepened, the temperature at the northern borders
                                            grew colder and colder. The current skies were dark and overcast, and the
                                            moon and stars could not be seen, as if snow could descend upon them at any
                                            time.</p>
                                        <p>“Fei’er.” Zhou Weiqing hugged her by the waist, enveloping her in his
                                            embrace. The two of them stood there right by Zhou Weiqing’s tent entrance.
                                            Tomorrow would be the day of him leaving with Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>“What is it?” Shangguan Fei’er lay quietly in his arms, but her heart was
                                            racing swiftly. She knew that not far away, her elder sister was watching
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>“Fei’er, do not worry about us at all. I will speak to Bing’er personally and
                                            explain everythign to her. No matter how she punishes me, I will accept it.
                                            However, in this period that I leave, you must think of me everyday, dream
                                            of me every night alright?”</p>
                                        <p>“Hmph! Won’t that mean I will have nightmares every night?” Shangguan Fei’er
                                            said exasperatedly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was slightly embarrassed at that, and he retorted: “Dreaming of
                                            me means having a nightmare huh? Let’s see how I punish you!” As he said
                                            that, he lowered his head to give her a kiss on the lips.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er was thrown into a fluster, just about to struggle. After
                                            all, her sister was watching from not far off, and though she might be known
                                            as the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she was still an
                                            innocent virgin. How could she be willing to be so intimate with Zhou
                                            Weiqing right in plain sight of her sister?</p>
                                        <p>“Fei’er, my wounds haven’t fully healed yet… if you beat me up now, it might
                                            reopen my wounds and delay my healing…” Zhou Weiqing gave an 'Oscar-worthy'
                                            pitiful look as he said that. With those shameless words, he managed to
                                            seize the opportunity that Shangguan Fei’er was momentarily stunned and
                                            catching her luscious lips.</p>
                                        <p>No matter how tough and powerful a girl was, being kissed by the man she
                                            loved, how could she easily resist. Furthermore, Shangguan Fei’er was
                                            actually afraid of reopening his wounds.</p>
                                        <p>Just like that, the two of them started kissing ardently as if no one else
                                            was around. Not far away, Shangguan Xue’er stood in the shadow of a large
                                            tent, her hands clenched angrily in fists, gripping her clothes to prevent
                                            herself from lashing out as she muttered to herself: “That bastard, so
                                            shameless! Such a scoundrel!”</p>
                                        <p>In the end, Shangguan Fei’er managed to break free and make her escape.
                                            However, in her heart she knew that if not for the fact that her sister was
                                            watching from a distance, perhaps she would have given in fully to the
                                            rogue, Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>The next morning, Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya stealthily left the Peerless
                                            Battalion. In the entire Peerless Battalion, besides the high ranking
                                            officers who had attended the meeting yesterday, none of the ordinary
                                            soldiers knew that Zhou Weiqing had left temporarily, lest it influence
                                            morale and fighting spirit. In the end, Zhou Weiqing had never been in
                                            charge of daily operations and training with the troops, so his temporary
                                            disappearance would not be easily noticed.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, this did not affect Zhou Weiqing’s position and status in the
                                            entire Peerless Battalion. It could be said that for the Peerless Battalion
                                            to advance to its current position, it had all been brought about by Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Before leaving, Zhou Weiqing had specially reminded Lin TianAo that although
                                            the Berserker and Gold Crow Tribe warriors who joined the Peerless Battalion
                                            only numbered each a thousand, he still wanted to order the full two
                                            thousand sets of equipment. After all, these two thousand warriors were an
                                            extremely limited resource even for the two Tribes, and the Peerless
                                            Battalion did not need be so petty in spending.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>The duo, Master and Disciple, galloped along the vast plains of the northern
                                            borders at a high speed. Zhou Weiqing was mounted on his Single-Horned Ghost
                                            Demon Horse, while Long Shiya had chosen a Unicorn Heavenly Beast. With his
                                            cultivation level, the Unicorn did not even need to be specially tamed, and
                                            would listen to his instructions without resistance.</p>
                                        <p>“Master, where are we headed?” Zhou Weiqing asked curiously. After exiting
                                            the army camp, Long Shiya did not bring him back to the ZhongTian Empire,
                                            instead continuing to head north. From the looks of things, they were headed
                                            deep into the WanShou Empire.</p>
                                        <p>“Do you know what is the Heavenly Spirit Fire?” Long Shiya glanced at him
                                            before asking.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya explained: “Heavenly Spirit Fire is a unique fire that has either
                                            descended from the heavens or risen from below the grounds. In our entire
                                            mainland, it is very rare to find such areas with these fires, but they
                                            definitely do exist. However, in order to make it for the coldest winter
                                            night timeline that we have, we are naturally going to the one in the
                                            WanShou Empire… only then will you have sufficient time to cultivate.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing asked curiously: “Do you mean… it is in the Ten Thousand Beast
                                            Heavens?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya shook his head and said: “Not exactly, but it is very close to the
                                            Ten Thousand Beast Heavens… the hottest area of the entire WanShou Empire.
                                            It is the Fire Spirit Mountain of the WanShou Empire Royal Family, the
                                            Lionmen Tribe’s Territory.”</p>
                                        <p>“According to legend, heavenly fire rained down from the heavens, sparking a
                                            volcano eruption from below, causing the mountain top to forever be burning
                                            with flame and smoke. Within a five hundred li radius of this volcano,
                                            temperature is always warm like the hottest day of summer. In the cold
                                            weather of the WanShou Empire, that is a miracle indeed, and only such an
                                            area would have such a warm temperature, as even the Ten Thousand Beast
                                            Heavens are affected by the four seasons. In any case, the Fire Spirit
                                            Mountain has Heavenly Spirit Fire, and it has always been occupied by the
                                            Lionmen Tribe. Just like the Lion Prince who injured you… he has probably
                                            cultivated there for quite some time. After all, the Royal Bloodline of the
                                            Lionman Tribe has the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion Bloodline, with the
                                            Fire, Divine and Light Attributes. As for the old fellow on the Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain, his Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodlines have the Divine,
                                            Light and Water Attributes. Of course, only their direct and purest
                                            bloodlines would have such the abilities. Indeed, it is because they have
                                            two Saint Attributes at the same time that has enabled the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain to reign supreme for so long.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but think to himself that the Fire Spirit Mountain
                                            must be of utmost importance to the Lionmen Tribe, perhaps even sacred
                                            ground to them! Only a powerhouse like his Master would dare bring him to
                                            such a place.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said: “In the following few days, I do not want you to cultivate
                                            at all. As we travel there, I want you to rest and fully recover and to
                                            bring your condition to its maximum peak, without any problems. When we
                                            reach the Fire Spirit Mountain, we will immediately begin closed door
                                            cultivation. According to my estimation, in order to Awaken your Solidified
                                            Dragon Spirit in advance, you will need to bathe in the Heavenly Spirit Fire
                                            for forty nine days before you can succeed..”</p>
                                        <p>As he spoke up to that point, Long Shiya’s eyes showed a thick worry.
                                            Clearly, he was worried about going through such a method. Although in
                                            theory they could succeed, it was without a doubt that it would not be
                                            without great danger, especially since it had not been actually done before.
                                            If Zhou Weiqing was not careful, he might even have his mind destroyed; even
                                            if he could ensure his survival, he would be ruined, at most living as an
                                            idiot the rest of his life.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not say anything else. He had already made up his mind, and
                                            he would not show any regret at this point. In any case, he did not have any
                                            choice for retreat; for Tian’er’s sake… for Tian’er’s sake…</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he thought about Tian’er, Zhou Weiqing felt full of fighting
                                            spirit. So what if it was forty nine days? He would definitely be able to
                                            endure it! If he couldn’t even endure this forty nine days, what right or
                                            qualification did he have to even ascend the Heavenly Snow Mountain?</p>
                                        <p>It was just the two of them, and they soon entered the WanShou Empire
                                            borders. In the distance, they could see the large camp of the WanShou
                                            Empire army on the vast plains.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to the ZhongTian Empire Northwest army camp, the WanShou Empire
                                            army camp was much simpler and crude; after all it was more of a temporary
                                            camp, and could just barely be used for survival. Such a barren and cold
                                            wasteland like the north, only the beastmen and their physique could survive
                                            in such plain and simple tents. Of course, the advantage of such simple and
                                            crude tents was that it was very easy for them to move. The supplies and
                                            logistics of the WanShou Empire armies had always been weak, and all of
                                            their people could be considered warriors.</p>
                                        <p>“Master, what are we going to do? Detour around?” Zhou Weiqing did not have
                                            the confidence to charge through such a massive army. An army of this size
                                            would definitely also have quite a few powerhouses along; just the Lion
                                            Prince and his two Heavenly King Stage guards would most likely be in the
                                            camp as well.</p>
                                        <p>“Keep your mount.” Long Shiya said.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing jumped off his Ghost Demon Horse, keeping both their mounts into
                                            his Spatial Ring.</p>
                                        <p>A pondering look entered Long Shiya’s eyes and he said slowly: “Little Fatty,
                                            what do you say… should I go beat up that Lion Prince and cripple him before
                                            we head to the Fire Spirit Mountain? As long as I cripple ‘that area’ of
                                            his, then even if he marries your woman, he won’t be able to do
                                            anything.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his Master’s words, Zhou Weiqing only felt a large bead of sweat form
                                            on his forehead… This Master Long os his… why did he seem so similar to his
                                            other Master… Mu En… Without hesitation, he said: “Master, this is my own
                                            personal problem. Any other fights, I will be willing to take any shortcuts
                                            as long as I can win, any strategy or tactics to help me win. However, in
                                            this case, I will not choose that option. Master, I want to fight openly and
                                            aboveboard with Gu YingBing personally on the coldest day of winter, and
                                            defeat him personally with my own hands.” If his Master really took action
                                            against the Lion Prince, he knew that the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord would
                                            definitely not marry Tian’er to him. If he wanted to gain back Tian’er, he
                                            could only do so with his own abilities, his own hands!</p>
                                        <p>“Very good, very good! High aspirations indeed! However, you little brat,
                                            you’re just too useless!” Long Shiya said with a displeased tone.</p>
                                        <p>“Useless?” Zhou Weiqing looked at him, puzzled.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya gave a humph and said: “Aren’t you truly useless? If you had given
                                            that Old Monster Xue’s daughter a few sons and daughters of her own earlier,
                                            come up with a Little Little Fatty, let’s see what he does. Hmph Hmph!”</p>
                                        <p>“Master… don’t play with me like that… So, how are we going to get across?!”
                                            Zhou Weiqing said with an exasperated look on his face.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya smiled and said: “Heh, I’ll let you enjoy the pleasures of flight
                                            for yourself.” Without any seeming movement, a flash of green light
                                            appeared, enveloping both him and Zhou Weiqing, and they instantly flew up
                                            into the air, soaring up high.</p>
                                        <p>In that instant, Zhou Weiqing felt as if the surrounding air had become a
                                            vast sea of wind, overwhelming all his senses from all directions as the
                                            Wind Attribute swept their bodies up into the skies.</p>
