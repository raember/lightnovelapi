                                            his entire body was pressured so hard that it felt terrible. Unless you used
                                            a Skill like Blink, otherwise he knew he would definitely not be able to
                                            escape such a fist.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing could not retreat. In the first place, he was best at this type
                                            of direct clash of physical strength and Heavenly Energy. Secondly, as a
                                            man, facing a challenge from his love rival, he could never back down so
                                            easily from just the first blow, otherwise he would already lose out in
                                            terms of psychology.</p>
                                        <p>In that instant, Zhou Weiqing gave up the thought of finishing the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal, as that would force him to expend extra effort and thought
                                            on it, and all his focus was now on facing this powerful blow from the Lion
                                            Prince.</p>
                                        <p>The Demonic Change State was now fully in effect, and Zhou Weiqing’s hands
                                            were now like large tiger paws, almost twice the size of his usual fist.
                                            With all his explosive strength behind him, he struck out directly back at
                                            Gu YingBing’s fist. Two men. Two love rivals. The first clash between the
                                            two happened just like that.</p>
                                        <p>*BANG*</p>
                                        <p>A violent explosion seemed to shake the entire earth as the two fists smashed
                                            against each other directly, without any flourishes. Those watching from a
                                            distance had the strange feeling as if the entire air around where the two
                                            had clashed had somehow shattered momentarily.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing staggered back two steps before regaining his balance, his right
                                            fist feeling totally numb at that moment.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was even worse off, as he had clearly heard a soft cracking
                                            sound from the bones in his right hand. Although they were not actually
                                            broken, he found that he was unable to apply strength with his entire right
                                            hand. At the same time, a powerful a violent bout of Heavenly Energy had
                                            invaded his entire body. If not for the fact that his strength was greatly
                                            multiplied by the Demonic Change State, just this blow alone from Gu
                                            YingBing could have killed him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s had been sent flying back, and while that was happening, he
                                            could only think inwardly: <i>Such strength, what a punch!</i></p>
                                        <p>He flew back more than a dozen yards, back to almost his original position,
                                            before he finally caught his balance, barely managing to land on his feet
                                            shakily, the sheer impact of it causing his feet to leave deep imprints on
                                            the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing’s eyes narrowed slightly. Zhou Weiqing was thinking that he was
                                            strong, but he too was taken aback by Zhou Weiqing’s strength. He had never
                                            imagined that a mere five-Jeweled little fellow would be able to receive his
                                            own blow just with the aid of the Demonic Change State. From the looks of
                                            things, he was not heavily injured either.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, with their sheer difference in cultivation level, Gu YingBing’s
                                            punch should have totally shattered Zhou Weiqing’s arm. However, after Zhou
                                            Weiqing had inherited the bloodline of the Dark Demon God Tiger, his entire
                                            body down to bones and marrow were far stronger, tougher and more flexible
                                            than normal, allowing him to escape serious injury now.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing did not pursue and attack right away, instead waiting for Zhou
                                            Weiqing to regain his balance. Only then did he raise his hands and crook a
                                            beckoning finger at Zhou Weiqing, a disdainful mocking look on his face.</p>
                                        <p>In the Demonic Change State, Zhou Weiqing was not easily excited to give in
                                            to compulsion, and he would not fall for his opponent’s provocation. The Ice
                                            Cold Perception allowed him to keep his perspective and focus, to stay in a
                                            stable state. Behind him, the Heavenly Skill Image of the Demonic Dragon
                                            Lady shimmered into existence again as he prepared to unleash the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal once more. Gu YingBing’s punch was already so terrifying, if
                                            he was allowed to use his other Skills and Consolidated Equipment, Zhou
                                            Weiqing knew that he would not stand a chance at all.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing’s eyes were contemptuous as he said mockingly: “If one were to
                                            compare Consolidated Equipment, no one can match the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace. However, comparing Stored Skills, who can be a match for us Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain?” As he said that, a golden-red light started to coalesce
                                            above his head, and one could barely see the image of a majestic gold-red
                                            lion forming in the light.</p>
                                        <p>The light around Gu YingBing’s body grew stronger, clearer, and he lifted his
                                            right hand. As he did so, the gold-red lion made of light above his head
                                            suddenly sprang into action, actually charging towards the Heavenly Skill
                                            Image of the Demonic Dragon Lady above Zhou Weiqing’s head.</p>
                                        <p><i>He is actually able to command his Heaven Skill Image to launch an
                                            attack? </i>Zhou Weiqing was caught off guard and surprised totally.</p>
                                        <p>The lion was just too quick, and there was no time to dodge at all. As it
                                            crashed into the Demonic Dragon Lady, a strange sight happened next.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not feel as if he had suffered any attack personally.
                                            However, the Heavenly Skill Image of the Demonic Dragon Lady vanished into
                                            thin air. Furthermore, in the Attribute Wheel in his eyes, the position
                                            denoting the Demonic Dragon Lady’s Skills darkened, and no matter what he
                                            tried, he was unable to activate them.</p>
                                        <p><i>What is going on? </i>This was the first time something like this had
                                            happened to Zhou Weiqing, and he could not understand what the Lion Prince
                                            had done to him.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion Prince could naturally see the shock in his eyes, and he said
                                            disdainfully: “Don’t you even know that when Heavenly Skill Images clash,
                                            they will offset and neutralize each other? A useless trash like you without
                                            any background, and you dare to taint Tian’er with your presence? Defile
                                            her? I cannot understand what she sees in you.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing retorted coldly: “I do not know what Tian’er sees in me, but I
                                            am definitely sure that she loves me, and not you, her so-called fiance. She
                                            will forever belong to me.”</p>
                                        <p>“Bastard!” The Lion Prince was provoked into a rage. What Zhou Weiqing said
                                            was after all true, and that was what hurt him the most… Even though before
                                            he left the Heavenly Snow Mountain to look for Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er had
                                            agreed to become his wife, he knew that her heart was not with him.</p>
                                        <p>A burst of red-gold light once more, and the Lion Prince charged at an
                                            unimaginable speed towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>The Dragon Silencing Seal had been neutralised and Zhou Weiqing was no longer
                                            able to use it. However, how could he admit defeat just like that? Two bouts
                                            of dark gold light sprang around him as the Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms
                                            formed around his hands.</p>
                                        <p>Another loud crash, this time a more muffled one. The Lion Prince actually
                                            managed to use his powerful Heavenly Energy to smash through and forcefully
                                            shatter both layers of Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura. In the
                                            next instant, his fist flickered out again towards Zhou Weiqing’s chest.</p>
                                        <p>Previously in a direct clash, he had already suffered a disadvantage. In a
                                            true fight, naturally Zhou Weiqing would not choose to do the same again,
                                            otherwise wouldn’t he just be asking for death?</p>
                                        <p>His two hands slid downwards, the Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms pushing down at
                                            the Lion Prince’s fist. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s body became
                                            lighter, as a shimmering layer of green light enveloped him. It was his Wind
                                            Attribute Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>With a soft puffing sound, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body flew away. At the same
                                            time, his hands held together towards his chest, forming a strange hand
                                            seal.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion Prince had once again sent Zhou Weiqing flying with punch, but this
                                            time he did not gain much advantage, as Zhou Weiqing had just used the
                                            momentum to retreat. Furthermore, at the same time as Zhou Weiqing flew
                                            back, Gu YingBing could clearly sense a powerful suction force coming from
                                            the pair of God Tier Consolidated Gloves, forcefully drawing away some of
                                            his Heavenly Energy before they lost contact.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing immediately lowered the previous disdain in his heart for Zhou
                                            Weiqing. Lifting his hands, a dark gold light flashed and a God Tier
                                            Consolidated Equipment appeared in his palms.</p>
                                        <p>It was a long staff, about four metres long, the thick staff body was carved
                                            in a dragon form, ending in a top with a massive dragon’s head. Just by
                                            looking at it, one did not need to hold it to be sure that this Dragon Head
                                            Staff was extremely heavy. After all, Gu YingBing’s Physical Jewels were the
                                            Strength Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>With the Dragon Head Staff in his hands, Gu YingBing used it to point
                                            forward, pushing it towards Zhou Weiqing’s body. However, just in the
                                            instant that his entire body charged forward, he abruptly moved to the side.
                                            The movement of the staff did not change, but his entire body flipped to the
                                            right twice, deviating several chi to the right from his original path.</p>
                                        <p>Right where Gu YingBing would have moved previously, a silver light flashed
                                            and disappeared. Although the time it appeared was extremely short, the
                                            powerful Heavenly Energy fluctuations that burst forth in that instant was
                                            able to show its sheer terrifying destructive capabilities. Earlier, if Gu
                                            YingBing had continued along his original path, his throat would have
                                            slammed right into the position of the silver light.</p>
                                        <p>Spatial Rend. One of the Skills that Zhou Weiqing was most adept in. By this
                                            time, he was already able to control the Spatial Rend to its maximum.
                                            However, such a well hidden Spatial Rend which showed no signs before it
                                            appeared was actually so easily dodged by the Lion Prince.</p>
                                        <p><i>Such powerful senses!</i> Zhou Weiqing’s heart was filled with shock, and
                                            he subconsciously used the Blink Skill. Due to him using the Spatial Rend,
                                            he no longer had the time to physically dodge the Dragon Head Staff.</p>
                                        <p>As his body disappeared and reappeared in a flash, Zhou Weiqing appeared over
                                            a dozen yards away from his previous position. From the start of their fight
                                            until now, he had been heavily suppressed by his opponent, no matter what he
                                            tried, giving him a feeling like he had the strength but could not use any
                                            of it.</p>
                                        <p>He did not know that at this moment, Gu YingBing was also extremely shocked.
                                            Zhou Weiqing was after all only at the five-Jeweled cultivation level, but
                                            no matter his strength or even the sheer control he had over that Spatial
                                            Rend Skill just now, it far surpassed the scope of a five-Jeweled Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master. Was that bastard really a Heavenly Jewel Master without
                                            background, and not from a Great Saint Lands?</p>
                                        <p>Although both of them were each harbouring their own thoughts, the fight
                                            still continued raging on. Gu YingBing’s feet tapped on the ground, his body
                                            once more pouncing at Zhou Weiqing like a ball of flame. He did not seem to
                                            be wielding the Dragon Head Staff with any particular unique skill, only a
                                            simple stab forward, and the eyes of the Dragon Head seemed the glitter with
                                            a gold light, as if about to unleash some powerful Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Since he started the fight, Gu YingBing had only used this one single
                                            Consolidated Equipment, and not any other Skills. Zhou Weiqing had been
                                            training together with Long Shiya for a time now, and his vision and outlook
                                            was at a much higher point than previously. He knew that the reason why Gu
                                            YingBing did this was not because he was underestimating Zhou Weiqing, but
                                            because he had sufficient self confidence. His Skills would only be used at
                                            the most important, most critical moments, when they were truly needed, and
                                            he would not use them normally and waste Heavenly Energy. Yet, Zhou Weiqing
                                            himself had already been forced to use several Skills.</p>
                                        <p>A light flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes as a plan hatched in his heart. <i>Aren’t
                                            you all about efficiency and keeping your cards close to your chest? Very
                                            well, I will unleash it all and give you a big surprise, let’s see how you
                                            deal with being caught off guard!</i></p>
                                        <p>In terms of tactics and strategy, Zhou Weiqing was always able to judge
                                            things clearly. Seeing the Dragon Head Staff reaching him, abruptly, two
                                            bouts of dark-gold light sprang out around him.</p>
