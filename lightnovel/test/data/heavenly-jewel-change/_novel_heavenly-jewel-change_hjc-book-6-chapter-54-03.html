                                            his cries were like that of a pig being butchered.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stared at noble students in shock, exclaiming in surprise:
                                            “Aiiyahhh, what is going on? I was so kind to help you pick up the arrow,
                                            why did you use your buttocks to receive it?! That must be some special
                                            martial arts you have trained in… Respect, much respect, it is amazing! Just
                                            too amazing!”</p>
                                        <p>Everybody stopped, shocked. The students of commoner class one had a very
                                            strange look on their faces. Looking at the honest looking smile on Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s face, all of them were delighted snidely in their hearts, but at
                                            the same time feeling a cold in their heart. That was indeed the smile of
                                            the devil!</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun muttered: “Is this the legendary ‘Breaking the Chrysanthemum’ [1. I
                                            think I've explained this before right? ;)]?? Boss Zhou, you are too
                                            savage!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at him and said: “You can eat anything, but you can't
                                            anyhow spread rumours!”</p>
                                        <p>“I was just returning the arrow to him. Who knew that this dear Senior of
                                            ours had such a powerful martial arts, to actually use that body part to
                                            receive the arrow… What has that got to do with me?”</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, someone among the noble students shouted out: “Shoot
                                            the bunch of common bastards!” And the other noble students actually picked
                                            up their bows and shot towards the commoner students.</p>
                                        <p>Although all the commoner students were Jewel Masters, yet the nobles still
                                            looked down upon them. In their eyes, for these lowly commoners to retaliate
                                            against them, it was unforgivable. Despite the arrows in their hands being
                                            mere training arrows, with over forty of them firing, it was still a rather
                                            powerful and frightening sight. This was especially so with them being so
                                            close to each other, and immediately the commoner students were aghast, with
                                            some of the more quick thinking ones dropping down and covering their heads,
                                            reducing their likelihood of being shot. Some others just glared angrily at
                                            the noble students.</p>
                                        <p>After all, although these commoner students were Jewel Masters, very few
                                            amongst them actually had Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills.</p>
                                        <p>Right at the moment, a sudden figure flashed like a shadow, and everyone else
                                            could only see a green brilliant light in the air, and the rain of arrows
                                            disappeared.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing'er landed softly beside Zhou Weiqing, her hands full of
                                            arrows, not a single one missing.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since they had entered the Fei Li Military Academy, Zhou Weiqing had
                                            drawn all the attention, and everyone had overlooked Shangguan Bing’er as
                                            just a pretty face. Now, as she displayed her power, only then did everyone
                                            realise that this beauty who had been under Zhou Weiqing’s protection could
                                            more than hold her own ground.</p>
                                        <p>Catching an arrow in mid air was not as simple as firing one, not to mention
                                            the fact it was a whole rain of arrows. Not only did it require an
                                            unbelievable speed, it was also the vision, judgement, type of movement,
                                            consciousness; all of that together in an impressive mix. Furthermore, when
                                            she did so, she still looked amazing and it seemed so easy, as if she had
                                            done something trivial.</p>
                                        <p>“You all are too much! We’re all schoolmates, and yet you actually fired
                                            arrows at us. What happens if someone gets hurt!?” Shangguan Bing’er was
                                            very even-tempered and seldom got angry. However, this time, seeing how far
                                            these noble students had went, she couldn’t help but take action.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was also amazed. In terms of long distance, straight-line
                                            running, with his Demonic Right Leg he was able to keep up with Shangguan
                                            Bing’er. However, in terms of short distance, dodging and rapid changes in
                                            movement, he was far from her capabilities. After all, Shangguan Bing’er was
                                            a three-Jeweled pure agility Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>However, the noble students did not seem to hear her words, and already their
                                            second salvo of arrows had already been launched. It was as if they had
                                            already fixated upon the commoner class one students as their targets.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er moved swiftly once more in a flash, she threw out the
                                            arrows in her hand, and they flew out in, separated in mid air, and all
                                            everyone heard was a continuous chain of *ting* *ting*, as each and every
                                            one of the arrows she threw out actually struck an enemy arrow.</p>
                                        <p>This time, even the noble students started, shocked. <i>Was this even humanly
                                            possible?!</i></p>
                                        <p>“Boss, what do we do?” Kou Rui asked Zhou Weiqing softly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said coldly: “Beat them up! Whoever doesn’t take action, you can
                                            get lost from our class now, our commoner class one does not have useless
                                            cowards!” As he said that, he charged forward in front of everyone. While in
                                            mid air, he actually managed to catch up to the arrows which had collided in
                                            mid air and were falling down, catching some of them and flung them out.
                                            Another few cries of pain sounded out.</p>
                                        <p>“Beat them up!” Ma Qun roared in anger, charging closely behind Zhou Weiqing.
                                            The other commoner students were already boiling in rage from the attack;
                                            after all, which of them had not been bullied by nobles from young, even
                                            after they had become Jewel Masters? Currently, being used as targets by
                                            these arrogant nobles, they couldn’t contain the anger anymore. With Zhou
                                            Weiqing at their head, all twenty nine of the students, even the Elemental
                                            Jewel Masters, charged forth towards the noble students.</p>
                                        <p>A distance of fifty yards, Zhou Weiqing closed the gap in two large bounds.
                                            Seeing him charge forth so quickly, the noble students tried to shoot him.
                                            Alas, who was Zhou Weiqing? He and Shangguan Bing’er had definitely not
                                            wasted their two years in the Heavenly Bow Unit. He was at the core a
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master Archer, and in terms of just archery alone, it was
                                            possible that there wasn’t anyone in the Fei Li Empire who could match
                                            him!</p>
                                        <p>Arrow after arrow reached him, was caught in his hand, and flung back to
                                            their source. By the time he had reached the nobles, almost half of them
                                            were already on the floor.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst the noble students, barely a quarter of them were Jewel Masters, and
                                            most of them were not of high cultivation level. In fact, this class was one
                                            of the weakest amongst the entire second level classes. Shooting arrows from
                                            afar was still something they could handle, but once it came to close
                                            combat, they were almost pushovers in comparison.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was the first to smash into the enemy lines, almost like a tiger
                                            dashing into a crowd of sheep. He did not even make use of any Heavenly
                                            Energy, in fact reining in some of his physical prowess. Even so, every
                                            noble student he struck flew back!</p>
                                        <p>There were eleven Jewel Masters in total amongst the noble students, but none
                                            of them were three Jewels. The highest cultivation level amongst them was
                                            two Jewels, and they were also all either Physical Jewel or Elemental Jewel
                                            Masters, with not a single Heavenly Jewel Master. As Zhou Weiqing flew
                                            deeper into their crowd, he activated his Touch of Darkness Skill.</p>
                                        <p>This was one of his first few Skills, and was also one that he was most
                                            practiced and well versed at. As the darkness tentacles shot forth from the
                                            ground quietly, in such a chaotic mess, almost nobody noticed him releasing
                                            the skill. Before any of the eleven noble Jewel Masters had released a
                                            single skill or Consolidated Equipment, they had been gripped by the
                                            tentacles and bound together. With their cultivation level, they were unable
                                            to resist his skill. For ordinary Jewel Masters, even a five or six Jeweled
                                            Master would be hard pressed to give Zhou Weiqing a lot of trouble.</p>
                                        <p>What happened next was naturally our dear Zhou Little Fatty charging amongst
                                            the rest of them like a bull in a china shop. His strength was tyrannical,
                                            and one strike caused the eleven Jewel Masters to fly apart, all injured to
                                            different extents. How could they possibly put up any other resistance after
                                            that?</p>
                                        <p>“Beat them up!!!”</p>
                                        <p>By this time, the rest of the commoner class one reached, the anger burning
                                            in their hearts causing them to forget their fear, and Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            ferocity also sparking the excitement in their hearts.</p>
                                        <p>In a matter of moments, the entire main square was filled with chaos, cries
                                            of pain sounding out all around.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, it was a one sided massacre, and before long, all forty of
                                            the noble students were fallen on the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua was hidden at the side, staring dumfounded. Earlier, Zhou Weiqing
                                            had just told her that he wanted to teach them a little lesson, and asked
                                            her to hide away for a while. This had originally only been a minor conflict
                                            between two students, but somehow it had escalated into a mass battle in a
                                            blink of an eye. Such a clash between classes was unheard of since the start
                                            of the Fei Li Military Academy!</p>
                                        <p>Seeing all the noble students had been knocked down onto the ground, groaning
                                            away in pain, Zhou Weiqing stopped. Looking around at the main school
                                            building, he immediately shouted out: “Everyone, stop now! It’s time! Quick,
                                            everyone lie down on the ground and roll around.”</p>
                                        <p>“Huh? What? Boss, what are we doing?” One of the male students asked
                                            curiously.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: “Are you a fool?! We are the victims! How
                                            can it be that the victims are fine, and the culprits are beaten up?”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun was the first to fall down onto the ground, laughing with glee in his
                                            heart. <em>This Boss Zhou is certainly bold, beating up these nobles and
                                                acting the victim in the next instant! I love it!</em></p>
                                        <p>As comprehension slowly dawned upon the class, they quickly followed suit.
                                            Although many of them felt this was rather shameless, none of them wanted to
                                            be expelled from school after all, and they all listened to Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            instructions, falling onto the ground and rolling around. Only the few
                                            female students were too embarrassed to do the same, looking at Zhou Weiqing
                                            pitifully.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing: “Alright, fine, the girls can just sit on the floor. However,
                                            you all need to cry and call out… as loud as possible. Boys, all of you roll
                                            around as much as possible! Make yourselves as dirty as possible! Oh right,
                                            quick, use some of their blood and rub it over yourselves! We need to cry
                                            out, as if in greater misery!”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, the class monitor had led by example. Rolling around on the
                                            ground, crying out aggrievedly at a huge volume.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s voice drifted into his ear: “You better not dirty your
                                            clothes too much, if not you wash your own clothes later!”</p>
                                        <p>Only then did Zhou Weiqing stop his plan to wipe mud and blood onto his
                                            clothes, but his cries just turned more real. If anyone heard it, it was so
                                            sorrowful that they would weep in compassion! Such a skill was something he
                                            had trained since  young age under the ‘tutelage’ of his father, Admiral
                                            Zhou. Currently, he took up his act once more, his experience in acting
                                            showing!</p>
                                        <p>Influenced by their monitor’s amazing acting, all of the commoner class
                                            students starting crying out exaggeratedly. The entire main square of the
                                            Fei Li Military Academy seemed like a battlefield, filled with pained cries
                                            and sobbing.</p>
                                        <p>At the side, Ming Hua closed her eyes helplessly. The only thought in her
                                            mind was: <i>Holy Heavens! How am I going to clean up this mess...</i></p>
                                        <p>Just like what Ming Yu had predicted previously… Zhou Weiqing’s arrival had
                                            indeed made things at the academy really… interesting.</p>
