                                            Weiqing’s eyes, as if trying to read something within.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, he could not see anything, not even any rheum[1. How many know what
                                            this actually is. I actually had to google for the technical term for ‘eye
                                            boogers’, in fact in the term in mandarin literally translates to that].</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Princess Cai Cai’s expression was rather ugly as she led the
                                            officials back down into the drilling ground.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, she had thought that when they won this round, she would ‘invite’
                                            Zhou Weiqing up to the stage. Alas, with the current situation, she would
                                            have to move down personally.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu turned his head back to look at Cai Cai walking in, and he took in a
                                            deep breath. In a low tone, he said to Zhou Weiqing: “I’ll look for you
                                            later.” After saying that, he walked back to Cai Cai, saying a few lines
                                            before turning back with an embarrassed look towards his Personal Guard
                                            Battalion. It was not going to be an easy task or a short time for his
                                            Personal Guard Battalion to regain combat effectiveness, and more
                                            importantly, to regain their morale. For a troop that had always lived with
                                            victory, it was a huge blow to them to suffer such a huge loss. Ming Yu had
                                            to personally return with them to comfort and console them and also guide
                                            them to enlighten them.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai stabilized her own emotions before heading towards Zhou Weiqing once
                                            more. In her eyes, besides shock and awe, there was a hint of fear. She knew
                                            that although there were several thousand Royal Family Cavalry soldiers here
                                            with them, if Zhou Weiqing truly wanted to make a move against them, with
                                            the power he had displayed, they would have no chance at all.</p>
                                        <p>As an onlooker, perhaps Princess Cai Cai could see many more things than Ming
                                            Yu. Even though he was the commander, he was also deep in the midst of
                                            things after all. If she was forced to use a sentence to describe that
                                            fight, just a few simple words would suffice: “Just too terrifying!”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, the only thing that fight brought her was a sense of utter
                                            terror.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai had never seen such a frightening army in her life. Although she had
                                            never actually been on the battlefield to see the WanShou Empire armies with
                                            her own eyes, she was certain that even they did not have any such dreadful
                                            warriors.</p>
                                        <p>Seven hundred men, just seven hundred men. Yet, when they burst forth with
                                            all their strength, the stifling feeling their presence brought was like
                                            that of a immense army of a million strong! Their fighting capabilities were
                                            just too terrifying.</p>
                                        <p>All of them were Jewel Masters. This one thing was clear in Cai Cai’s heart.
                                            Amongst the seven hundred, besides the two hundred heavy cavalry soldiers
                                            she had not been able to perceive clearly, the rest of the five hundred
                                            cavalry soldiers were definitely Jewel Masters. As for those two hundred she
                                            could not see through clearly, the power they unleashed on the battlefield
                                            seemed even more terrifying than any Jewel Master held. A crushing victory
                                            over the strongest and most elite troop of the entire Fei Li Empire! Facing
                                            such absolute chance, there was no chance… just like when Shen Wang faced up
                                            against Zhou Weiqing!</p>
                                        <p>Such a troop of seven hundred… if they appeared on any battlefield, it would
                                            definitely bring about a sweeping victory. How could the ZhongTian Empire
                                            possibly be willing to pass such a troop to Zhou Weiqing? Could it be a
                                            direct core troop of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace?</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Cai Cai’s heart was in a mess, and her usual composure had been
                                            thrown off. She finally understood why Zhou Weiqing had been so confident as
                                            to provoke her so easily. If this seven hundred soldiers truly belonged to
                                            the Heavenly Bow Empire, then he definitely had the right to do so.</p>
                                        <p>Although these seven hundred was far from sufficient to allow the Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire to restore their Empire, but their existence was tantamount to
                                            the Heavenly Bow Empire having a key to do so. Let alone the Kalise Empire,
                                            she was confident that even the Bai Da Empire would not have any troop that
                                            could block these seven hundred without a massive numeric advantage.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly as he received Cai Cai, saying: “Your Highness,
                                            this third round should be considered our victory right?”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai was quickly brought out of her thoughts. With a complicated look at
                                            Zhou Weiqing, she said: “This troop of yours… they will accompany you all
                                            the way in reviving your Empire?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed: “Of course, this is my own troop after all. Your
                                            Highness, have you forgotten my self introduction? I am the Peerless
                                            Regiment’s Regiment Commander, Zhou Weiqing. Brothers, tell Her Highness,
                                            what is our motto?”</p>
                                        <p>A deafening roar as a united shout rang out instantly: “PEERLESS IN THE
                                            WORLD!”</p>
                                        <p>If it had been before that battle, such a motto would have caused all the Fei
                                            Li officials to scoff contemptuously. However, the four words now just sent
                                            a shockwave in their hearts.</p>
                                        <p>Peerless in the world. Such proud and arrogant words… yet they truly had the
                                            power to back it up. At least, in Cai Cai’s memory, she had never seen such
                                            a troop with such terrifying combat prowess.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, Cai Cai’s entire body shuddered slightly.
                                            Peerless...Regiment? Could it be…he had an entire Regiment of such warriors?
                                            But… If that was true...</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that amused look in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, Cai Cai forced her breathing
                                            to calm down. Finally, she smiled with her usual grace. Although it seemed a
                                            tad forced, at least she had not lost her composure.</p>
                                        <p>“If Commander Zhou really has an entire Regiment filled with such warriors,
                                            the hopes of revival of your Empire is truly high indeed.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not pretend to be modest, nodding his head as he said: “I do
                                            think so myself. In any case, since this third round is considered our
                                            victory, then may Your Highness please come up with the next round’s
                                            topic?”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai’s mind went into a whirl. Originally, she had planned that if Ming Yu
                                            won the third round, she would invite the Heavenly King Stage powerhouse
                                            again to clinch the final round. After all, they had not set any rules
                                            previously against re-doing a round’s topic. In that case, she would have
                                            been able to clinch the final victory with relative ease. Alas, the current
                                            situation did not allow her to use that plan any longer. Even if they won
                                            like that, then for the fifth and last round, Zhou Weiqing could also do the
                                            same as request for another seven hundred vs seven hundred fight. Who could
                                            possibly take on those Peerless Regiment soldiers?</p>
                                        <p>Biting her lip lightly, Cai Cai thought for a while before saying: “Commander
                                            Zhou, previously our bet should have some restrictions that I forgot to
                                            mention. For those topics that we have already competed in, we shall not
                                            repeat them alright?”</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing could be said to hold the pearl of wisdom [2. Be in
                                            the position where he can cope with all schemes and strategies]. Having won
                                            the third round, he had an absolute advantage. Even if he failed in this
                                            upcoming fourth round, it was a strong chance he could still win the fifth
                                            since he could control the topic. As such, he did not mind Cai Cai’s little
                                            tricks like this, nodding his head generously in agreement. Of course, he
                                            knew it was because Cai Cai was afraid of his Peerless Regiment
                                            soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai secretly heaved a sigh of relief before smiling as she said: “If I
                                            remember correctly, Commander Zhou should be a Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master right? In that case, shall we set the topic of the fourth round to be
                                            creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls? Just a single piece, and the side
                                            who creates the higher quality Scroll will be the victor. What do you
                                            think?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily, his mouth starting to twitch slightly as
                                            his expression grew strange… “Your Highness, could it be the Fei Li Empire
                                            has somehow succeeded in recruiting a God Tier Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master?”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai flushed deeply. She thought that Zhou Weiqing was making a snide
                                            remark to mock the fact that she was using the entire resources of an empire
                                            to suppress a small diplomatic party. She thought to herself: <i>You are the
                                                one who forced this Princess to such a state, what other choice do I
                                                have?</i></p>
                                        <p>“... How could it be so easy to recruit a God Tier Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master? Their numbers are extremely limited in the entire Mainland, and
                                            though I wish it was so, I’m afraid that our Fei Li Empire does not
                                            currently hold such abilities. However, we still do have some Grandmasters
                                            in the Royal Palace. Master Han Gao, I will have to trouble you for this
                                            round.”</p>
                                        <p>As Cai Cai spoke out, a middle aged man walked out from the group of
                                            officials, looking to be around forty years of age. As the man walked to the
                                            front to stand beside Cai Cai, Zhou Weiqing’s heart gripped in slight
                                            shock.</p>
                                        <p>The man’s gaze was peaceful and calm, as if he had not seen Zhou Weiqing. His
                                            eyes seemed to be far off, as if deep in thought, though no one knew what he
                                            was thinking about. Even when he was facing Princess Cai Cai, he only gave
                                            her a slight nod of greeting.</p>
                                        <p>Towards his looks, Zhou Weiqing did not really pay attention. From this man’s
                                            eyes, he could clearly sense… this was one of those stubborn lunatics!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had seen such eyes many times before, and he instantly knew
                                            those who held such gazes were extremely stubborn, holding all their faith
                                            and belief in a single subject, spending all their lives working towards
                                            that single target.</p>
                                        <p>Everything else, they could ignore. Using the phrase ‘stubborn lunatics’ was
                                            truly just too apt. This was without question a very talented Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master, and his stubbornness and resolve was definitely in that
                                            area. In such a case, his abilities in creating Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls should not be low.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing was a Consolidating Equipment Master in his own right,
                                            he had not spent much time on it. In the past year and more, he had spent
                                            all of his time focusing on his training and cultivation, and any remaining
                                            time had been dealing with the matters of the Peerless Battalion. By now,
                                            even Yun Li had far surpassed him in terms of Consolidating Equipment Master
                                            skills. If he personally tried to face off against this middle aged man in
                                            front of him, the result was not going to be pretty. In his heart, he knew
                                            it was a sure loss.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai looked at Zhou Weiqing and said: “Commander Zhou, will you be
                                            personally taking on this fourth round? Or will someone else in your party
                                            participate?”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai suddenly laughed. The reason he had a strange expression on his face
                                            when Cai Cai had come up with this fourth topic was very simple - it had
                                            actually been his plan to use this as the fifth topic! In this regard,
                                            perhaps it had been a strange wordless linked fate.</p>
                                        <p>“...Your Highness, please wait a moment.” As he said that, Zhou Weiqing
                                            turned and walked towards the horse carriage where Princess Difuya was
                                            seated.</p>
                                        <p>As he walked to the front of the horse carriage, he bowed respectfully in a
                                            full ninety degree bow. “Senior Uncle, could I please trouble you.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had used his Heavenly Energy voice transference, so Cai Cai
                                            could not hear what he was saying. However, as she watched him bow down, she
                                            was very curious. Could it be, Zhou Weiqing was asking Princess Difuya to
                                            come out? Or was he looking for instructions?”</p>
                                        <p>From the horse carriage, Long Shiya’s exasperated voice rang out in his ears.
                                            “You little brat, how could you trouble your Senior Uncle over such a
                                            trivial matter?”</p>
                                        <p>Duan Tianlang’s lazy voice rang out right after. “Enough about that Fatty
                                            Long, don’t act in front of me. Don’t think I do not know your character so
                                            well. If I refuse to help this round, would you go and compete in the next
                                            round? Haiz… Weiqing, I have to say, you are after all the heir to our
                                            Legacy of Strength Sect, the sole legacy carrier of the ‘Hate Ground no
                                            Handle’ Legendary Set. Your Senior Uncle’s ‘Hate Sky no Handle’ Legendary
                                            Set designs I also plan to impart to you in the future. I can help you now,
                                            but I hope that you can put some time to focus on your Consolidating
                                            Equipment skills.”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, in the large horse carriage, it was not just Princess Difuya seated
                                            within. Long Shiya and Duan Tianlang had also come along. Zhou Weiqing was
                                            only bringing a few hundred soldiers to the Fei Li Empire, and Long Shiya
                                            was a little worried. Since he did not have anything else to do, he decided
                                            to just come along, even dragging Duan Tianlang along with him. Although on
                                            the surface he had insisted that he would not intervene in the revival of
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire, with him along, it was tantamount to Zhou Weiqing
                                            having a god bodyguard with him. This was also the reason why Zhou Weiqing
                                            had acted so arrogantly… that little rascal had absolute confidence!</p>
