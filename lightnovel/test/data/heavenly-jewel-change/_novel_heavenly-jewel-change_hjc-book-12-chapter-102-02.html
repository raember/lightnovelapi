                                            this time she used her original voice, the clear crisp beautiful voice
                                            clearly with a note of anger within. Lifting her hands and with a slight
                                            tilt of her claws, a well crafted mask flew off her face.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing, who was charging at her with all his might, propelled by his
                                            Tornado Strike Skill, was shocked by the sudden sight in front of him. He
                                            was totally stunned to see that the common look of that female ZhongTian
                                            Battle Team member was now… exactly the same as Shangguan Bing’er!</p>
                                        <p>Although logic told him that this could not be Shangguan Bing’er in front of
                                            him, as the power levels was just too different, he could not bring himself
                                            to continue his attack. Even if it were any of her two sisters, how could he
                                            possibly really injure them?</p>
                                        <p>Without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing instantly dismissed the two Legendary
                                            Hammers in his hands. Still in midair, his right leg struck the ground
                                            savagely, changing the direction just before he rammed into her.</p>
                                        <p>As for Little Witch, when she saw the female ZhongTian Battle Team member
                                            reveal her true appearance, she was also surprised. She quickly removed her
                                            Shadow Chase skill, skipping lightly to the side.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing pass by her, the female ZhongTian Battle Team member felt
                                            the anger rise within her, and couldn’t help but give his buttock a swift
                                            kick.</p>
                                        <p>This young lady opponent of theirs was no other than Shangguan Bing’er’s
                                            second sister, Shangguan Fei’er. Having had her first kiss stolen by Zhou
                                            Weiqing, she had been so vexed that she had instigated Zhan LingTian’s
                                            anger, getting him to secretly sneak her into the ZhongTian Battle Team by
                                            using a mask to disguise herself. In such a manner, she had entered this
                                            Finals of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament to seek revenge.</p>
                                        <p>Although Shangguan Fei’er’s cultivation level was not as high as Shangguan
                                            Fei’er, she was also extremely talented, one of the top genius of the young
                                            generation, with the Mutated Duo Physical Jewels, which was one of the
                                            rarest and more powerful mutations. If not for the fact that she had such an
                                            important status in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, how could she possibly get
                                            so many God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters to help her design and
                                            create a specialised Legendary Set? After all, these God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Masters had an extremely exalted status within the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace, and they had no other obligation besides helping only the
                                            Palace Master and the direct heir to create the Boundless Infinitum Set.
                                            Besides that, they could not be forced to help the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.
                                            Shangguan Fei’er had coaxed and pestered them unceasingly with all her wiles
                                            before successfully getting her current four God Tier Consolidated
                                            Equipment. The Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was indeed
                                            notorious in the entire Heavenly Jewel Island, perhaps her name was even
                                            more known than her elder sister Shangguan Xue’er, the heir and future
                                            Palace Master!</p>
                                        <p>As such, she had never expected that with all her power, she could actually
                                            lose to the combination of Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch! Even though the
                                            two of them were working together, she had four God Tier Consolidated
                                            Equipment, all part of a Legendary Set!</p>
                                        <p>Still in midair, Zhou Weiqing received the kick from her and instantly lost
                                            his balance. *Peng* He crashed right into a large tree before tumbling down
                                            onto the ground.</p>
                                        <p>However, even this kick gave Shangguan Fei’er a large surprise. When her foot
                                            connected with Zhou Weiqing, a powerful elastic force burst forth from his
                                            muscles involuntarily, the shockwaves actually causing her right foot to be
                                            numbed momentarily. At the same time, it was clear that a strange white
                                            light formed a whirlpool around the spot she had kicked, dissipating the
                                            Heavenly Energy around her kick.</p>
                                        <p>Even though she had not used much Heavenly Energy in that kick, it was
                                            without question that Zhou Weiqing’s defense was far beyond any
                                            Three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, even taking into account his Demonic
                                            Change State.</p>
                                        <p>In the distance, Little Witch stared at the two of them, saying in surprise:
                                            “Weiqing, what is going on?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing vaulted back up from the ground, releasing his Demonic Change
                                            State as he looked gloomily at Shangguan Fei’er before saying: “How would I
                                            know what is going on? She is definitely not Bing’er… and I don’t think it
                                            is Shangguan Xue’er either… You… you are Shangguan Fei’er right?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er gave a cold smile, saying: “Hmph! So you can still remember
                                            who I am! Zhou Weiqing, if you dare touch me again today, I will make sure
                                            that you will never ever end up with Bing’er!”</p>
                                        <p>“You dare threaten me?” Zhou Weiqing said angrily. “I have already gone easy
                                            on you!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er gave a disdainful humph, saying: “You two are fighting me
                                            two against one, and you dare say you have gone easy on me? I sneaked into
                                            this Heavenly Jewel Tournament because of you!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but say curiously: “Huh? You sneaked into the
                                            Tournament because of me? Why? Have you fallen for me too?!”</p>
                                        <p>“Bullshit! You took advantage of me, and now you are trying to deny it? If
                                            you do not give me a good accounting, I will not let you off.” Shangguan
                                            Fei’er snarled angrily, her face a mask of anger. She had been doted upon
                                            lovingly since she was young, and no one would ever dare to take advantage
                                            of her. Yet, her first kiss had just been stolen like that. Her fury was far
                                            beyond even Shangguan Xue’er’s.</p>
                                        <p>After all, no matter what, Shangguan Xue’er was the heir and future Palace
                                            Master of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. She had been trained from young as
                                            such, and her character was definitely more suited as well, being a lot more
                                            logical and trained to see reason. Alas, Shangguan Fei’er was definitely not
                                            the same, and she was the vengeful type indeed, how could she possibly let
                                            Zhou Weiqing go so easily.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch looked at Zhou Weiqing strangely, saying: “Weiqing, you are just
                                            too beastly, you won’t even let Bing’er’s sister go? Alright, this is a
                                            personal matter then, you two settle it on your own, I’ll be by the side.”
                                            As she said that, she turned around and walked away.</p>
                                        <p>It was Zhou Weiqing’s turn to get angry. “Beastly your head! Didn’t you see
                                            she looks exactly the same as Bing’er? They are triplets, who could possibly
                                            recognize them from each other? I didn’t take advantage of her on purpose,
                                            furthermore it was just a little kiss… That time, Shangguan Xue’er gave a
                                            such a huge slap that my face was swollen for days, but this girl gave me
                                            such a beating already!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er defended herself, saying: “If I do not blame you, then who?!
                                            Who asked you not to look clearly before running over to take advantage of
                                            me? In any case, I don’t care, since you already kissed me, then you better
                                            give a good accounting of yourself, otherwise I won’t let it go so
                                            easily.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a cold humph before saying: “Do as you wish. If you can,
                                            just kill me then.”</p>
                                        <p>Just as the atmosphere was freezing as the impasse continued, all of a
                                            sudden, the sky lit up once more a another Heaven’s Expanse Palace signal
                                            flare burst out.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er’s face changed. Although she was capricious and headstrong,
                                            she still could put the big picture ahead of her own needs. Seeing the
                                            second signal flare light up, it could only mean one thing: The ZhongTian
                                            Battle Team was in huge trouble.</p>
                                        <p>“I’ll deal with you later.” Saying that, she spun around and flew off swiftly
                                            in the direction of the signal flare.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at her retreating figure, Zhou Weiqing had a gloomy expression on his
                                            face. <i>What am I do to?! A future fight and opponent, Shangguan Xue’er, is
                                                already giving me a huge headache, and now an unreasonable sister
                                                Shangguan Fei’er is added to the mix. Furthermore, her power is almost
                                                just as strong, and definitely not someone I can handle by myself. Add
                                                in this Little Witch, mischievous and unpredictable as she is, and the
                                                wonderful but trouble-bringing Tian’er in his arms… That is not even
                                                mentioning his own dear Bing’er...</i></p>
                                        <p>The saying goes ‘Three women can form an opera’[1. That is a very literal
                                            translation of a chinese saying. Basically, it’s saying that when many women
                                            are together, they cannot resist chit chatting with each other and
                                            discussing secrets, with each voicing their opinion etc. The more there are,
                                            the more lively the atmosphere, until one can almost form an opera.], but he
                                            had five beside him! Each with a terrifying background, each with a murky
                                            connection to him. How was he going to continue living from now on!</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that Shangguan Fei’er had left, Little Witch sidled up to Zhou
                                            Weiqing, saying apologetically: “Weiqing, I did not know it was all a
                                            misunderstanding, and I thought you had really taken advantage of her. You
                                            won’t blame me right?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her exasperatedly, saying: “What blame? Come on let’s
                                            go as well, we should have a look at what happened to the ZhongTian Battle
                                            Team, that they actually need to use their signal flare twice.” No matter
                                            what, they had to try to finish this Heavenly Jewel Tournament the best they
                                            could. By that them, after he left the Heavenly Jewel Island, the immense
                                            sea will allow the fish to leap at liberty, and the vast sky will allow
                                            birds to fly freely. [2. Another literal translation, basically means he
                                            will be free to do whatever he wants then] At the most, he will run away
                                            from them all, and when he was powerful enough, he would return to bring
                                            Bing’er away. Too many women is also a cause of headache! Although Zhou
                                            Weiqing loved beautiful women, he was also afraid of trouble. Furthermore,
                                            besides Tian’er, who he had deeper feelings for, both Shangguan Xue’er and
                                            Fei’er were half enemies or sorts, and even Little Witch was together with
                                            him more for a mutually beneficial agreement. Running away from them, Zhou
                                            Weiqing would not feel any burden in his heart.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch flew closer to Zhou Weiqing. She could clearly sense a slight
                                            coldness from him, and couldn’t help but furrow her brow slightly. This
                                            young man looked to be honest and naive on the surface, but he was extremely
                                            cunning inside. He might act the part of a pervert at times, but in truth,
                                            no one could really tell what he was thinking inside. Such a strange,
                                            unpredictable nature, it was truly mystifying.</p>
                                        <p>From Little Witch’s perspective, her first impression of Zhou Weiqing at
                                            first was that she did not like this young man. The only reason she followed
                                            by his side, even sacrificing her own values to flirt and seduce him, it was
                                            all for the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p>
                                        <p>However, as they spent more time together, she realised that Zhou Weiqing was
                                            always constantly surprising her. He was clearly only at the three-Jeweled
                                            cultivation level, yet he could always accomplish deeds that no one else
                                            could.</p>
                                        <p>Women always liked the strong, especially women with a background like hers,
                                            from a Great Saint Lands, used to seeing so many genius and talents. In
                                            order to conquer their hearts, one had to be able to have the power to
                                            conquer them first.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing naturally did not have the power to do so currently, but the
                                            display of his unbelievable talent was truly obvious throughout the entire
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament. He might not be extremely handsome, but he had a
                                            certain bad boy charm about him that slowly grew more pleasing to the eye to
                                            Little Witch, bit by bit. In that moment when Zhou Weiqing turned to leave,
                                            she suddenly felt a small sense of loss. She knew that in Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            heart, she could never be equal to Tian’er, let alone Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>Just as she was lost in wild thoughts, she suddenly looked up to see that
                                            Tian’er, in her Fat Cat form, had leaped up onto Zhou Weiqing’s shoulder,
                                            looking at her with a provocative look on her face.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch glared at her, before quickly leaping into the air and chasing
                                            after Zhou Weiqing. At the same time, a Life Attribute recovery Skill fell
                                            upon Zhou Weiqing, to alleviate the pain he felt from Shangguan Fei’er’s
                                            kick.</p>
                                        <p>Chance… she had to wait for and seize an opportunity! This was the sole
                                            thought in Little Witch’s mind. As for when such an opportunity would
                                            appear, she did not know, but she believed in her heart that it would
                                            eventually appear for her.</p>
                                        <p>In just the few moments they had milled around, Shangguan Fei’er had already
                                            disappeared into the distance. However, with the signal flare clear in the
                                            distance, they would not have any trouble following her.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not proceed ahead at a quick pace, as he still needed to
                                            circulate his Immortal Deity Technique in order to recover his Heavenly
                                            Energy. Furthermore, Little Witch had also expended a large amount of
                                            Heavenly Energy earlier, and she did not have the recovery speed of Zhou
                                            Weiqing. As such, the two of them moved on at a leisurely pace towards the
                                            direction of the signal flare.</p>
