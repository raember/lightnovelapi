                                            stimulated, growing in power until it matched the blue lines.</p>
                                        <p>As the two twisted and undulated around each other, the four lights also grew
                                            stronger.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>The Fei Li Battle team’s luck was still considered relatively good. As Lin
                                            TianAo had said earlier, being so close to the main official roads of the
                                            Zhong Tian Empire, there weren’t that many Heavenly Beasts. Of course, there
                                            were many more Heavenly Beasts deeper in the forests, but it was quite a
                                            distance from where they were, and the aura that the little white tiger
                                            would give off when evolving had a limited range.</p>
                                        <p>After the two attacks from the Blood Blaze Lion and the Dark Demon Ape, it
                                            was another six hours before a third round of attacks from Heavenly Beasts
                                            arrived. After which, they were attacked every few hours, but with smaller
                                            scale attacks. Although it was extremely tough, they still managed to pull
                                            through.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, the team members also realised something important - the
                                            Heavenly Beasts which attacked them had all lost control, in some sort of an
                                            unstable frenzy. That was also the main reason why they had not been able to
                                            make use of their full power. Also, these Heavenly Beasts were mostly either
                                            all Zong Stage, or led by Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Time seemed to fly, and soon three days had passed. During that time, they
                                            had been constantly attacked at intervals, and the toughest fights were when
                                            they were attacked by two High Level Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts. At the last
                                            moment, Shangguan Bing’er had released the two Icy Soul Heavenly Bears to
                                            help out, and they had finally managed to hold their own. With much
                                            teamwork, and the sacrifice of several members sustaining heavy injuries, in
                                            the end they barely managed to finish off the High Level Zong Stage
                                            Beasts.</p>
                                        <p>Little Four sat on the ground heavily, panting and gasping for breath. “I
                                            can’t make it anymore Boss, I’m dead beat. If this continues, even if we
                                            don’t get killed by Heavenly Beasts, we’ll go crazy!”</p>
                                        <p>For the last three days, they had spent every single second tensed up and
                                            with their nerves frayed, not knowing when they would be attacked by
                                            Heavenly Beasts. They had to maintain a high alert at all times, and as they
                                            fought wave after wave of Heavenly Beasts, it had taken a huge toll on them.
                                            After all, these Heavenly Beasts were all frenzied, and although that had
                                            helped a lot in reducing their intelligence and skill, it had also caused
                                            them to not be able to be chased off, and they could only fight to the
                                            death.</p>
                                        <p>The wounds on their bodies and the constant drain of Heavenly Energy was
                                            taxing, but the worst toll was on their spirits. Three days and nights of
                                            constant fighting and limited rest, even the toughest person would feel
                                            exhausted and low in spirit. For someone firm and resolute like Lin TianAo,
                                            or someone whose character was rather thick skinned [1. That isn’t really a
                                            good translation, more like someone who doesn’t take things to heart easily?
                                            The chinese phrase is 精神大条. Not sure of a good phrasing for this, will look
                                            at comments and change if someone has a good suggestion] like Crow, it was
                                            still relatively okay, but the rest of the team members were almost on the
                                            verge of breakdown.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, it was also clear the difference in overall power and
                                            character amongst the entire team. The first one to fall was not the one
                                            with the lowest cultivation level, Shangguan Bing’er, but Ye Paopao.</p>
                                        <p>Although Ye Paopao was a four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, as the son of
                                            the prime minister, he had lived an easy life of luxury since young. Despite
                                            his cultivation, he had never had much actual combat experience, let alone
                                            such high intensity fighting. At this moment, he was leaning against the
                                            cave entrance, unconscious.</p>
                                        <p>As for the second person who was having trouble was still not Shangguan
                                            Bing’er After her two years of tough training and experience in the Heavenly
                                            Bow Unit, this was not her first rodeo facing such tough battles.
                                            Furthermore, the person they were protecting was her precious Little Fatty.
                                            Under such a circumstance, she would never give up no matter how exhausted
                                            she was, just through sheer will. Shangguan Bing’er might not be extremely
                                            powerful, and against Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts, she could barely do
                                            anything but harassing attacks. However, if it was a Zong Stage Heavenly
                                            Beast leading several Zun Stage Heavenly Beasts, she turned into one of the
                                            most important keys of the team defense. Just her rapid firing archery alone
                                            could suppress a large number of Zun Stage Heavenly Beasts, allowing her
                                            companions time to leisurely deal with all the enemies.</p>
                                        <p>By now, Little Four was nearing the end of his stamina. His job was to run
                                            around to wherever needed help the most, and any issue that cropped up, his
                                            speed was usually the key to a successful save or support.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, he also had to go around scouting. Naturally, the drain on
                                            his spirit was also extremely huge.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo furrowed his brow, glancing back at the cave entrance. As a team
                                            leader, how could he not be worried? Looking at the weakened condition of
                                            his team members, as well as the constant attacks, he grew increasingly
                                            worried as time passed. As soon as a Heavenly Beast which they could not
                                            deal with attacked, that meant they could possibly all fall here. Taking a
                                            deep breath, Lin TianAo made his decision, a resolute look crossing his face
                                            as he said solemnly: “Crow, Drunken Bao, both of you lead the rest away and
                                            head for the city. I will stay here to defend the cave.”</p>
                                        <p>As soon as everyone heard that, they were shocked. Drunken Bao said urgently:
                                            “How could we possibly do that? To leave you here alone?!”</p>
                                        <p>The past three days, the person who had taken on the most pressure was
                                            definitely Lin TianAo. Every single Zong Stage Heavenly Beast was taken on
                                            by him, and it was only because of his Rock Like defense and stable fighting
                                            skills that had allowed their team to last for so long. In terms of energy
                                            consumption, who could be more exhausted than him!</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo said solemnly: “This is an order. With your numbers, you will
                                            still be able to attend the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Even if Zhou Weiqing
                                            and I do not make it, it should not affect the entire team. Hurry up and
                                            leave this place. As long as you do not stay near the cave entrance, you
                                            should be safe. If Zhou Weiqing and I make it, we will catch up with
                                            you.”</p>
                                        <p>“Big Bro Lin, I definitely will not leave. I will stay here and defend the
                                            place with you.” Shangguan Bing’er said unhesitatingly. With her Little
                                            Fatty still inside, how could she possibly leave?</p>
                                        <p>Little Four summoned all his energy and propped himself up in a sitting
                                            position. “I will not leave you here alone as well, Boss. If we leave, what
                                            will happen to you? If you want to leave, we will leave together, but I
                                            think we should all stay. I can still last a while more.” If it were anyone
                                            else, he might have suggested that everyone leave together, and abandon Zhou
                                            Weiqing. However, Zhou Weiqing had done him and Drunken Bao such a huge
                                            favour, and they could have been said to be in his debt. Although Little
                                            Four’s character was probably the most casual amongst the entire team, at
                                            this point he couldn’t help but say he would stay to defend Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>“Nonsense. I said, this is an order!” Lin TianAo cried out angrily, showing
                                            the dignity and aura of a leader.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, at this moment, no one would listen to this order. Crow turned her head
                                            to look away, stretching lazily as she worked out the kinks in her muscles.
                                            It had to be said that Crow was definitely worthy of her name of the Gold
                                            Crow Tribe’s top genius; after three days and nights of furious battles, she
                                            was the only one who seemed unaffected. Any time a Heavenly Beast appeared,
                                            her attacks were always the most ferocious. Despite some wounds on her body,
                                            she still looked unconcerned and relaxed. Perhaps, in terms of cultivation
                                            level and power, she might not be as powerful as Drunken Bao or Xiao Yan who
                                            were five-Jeweled. However, if it was a fight to the death, the likely final
                                            result would her victory. After all, the Gold Crow Tribe was renowned for
                                            their battle prowess, and she was considered the top genius of her
                                            generation! Even amongst her tribe members, not counting her Heavenly
                                            Jewels, she was famous for her physical strength alone.</p>
                                        <p>Little Four kept his mouth shut, while Drunken Bao sat on the ground resting,
                                            humming a tune to himself. Xiao Yan just looked at Lin TianAo and said
                                            resolutely: “We are a team.”</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, a clear crisp voice rang out. “Waaah! So many corpses! So
                                            scary!”</p>
                                        <p>Everyone started upon hearing the voice. For the past three days, they had
                                            faced so many Heavenly Beasts, but this was the first time they had met any
                                            other humans. After all, this was quite a distance from the road, and even
                                            if any traveller were resting at the side of the road, they would not head
                                            so deep into the forest.</p>
                                        <p>Along with the bell-like voice, a young lady walked out from the trees. She
                                            looked to be even younger than Shangguan Bing’er, about sixteen to seventeen
                                            years of age. Two black braids of hair at her sides, she looked the picture
                                            of the girl next door. Her large eyes were bright and touching, but the
                                            thing that caught their attention the most was her pupils, which were a dim
                                            grey colour. That was definitely something rare.</p>
                                        <p>The young lady was not very tall, about 1.6 metres tall or so. However, she
                                            was pretty well-proportioned, in the bloom of puberty, full of the
                                            attraction of youth. Wearing a long black dress, she looked attractive.
                                            However, the strangest thing was that although they were in the forest, her
                                            feet were naked, yet she did not seem to feel anything as she walked across
                                            the forest ground.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, she was looking at the blood in the area, and the mass of
                                            dead Heavenly Beasts. Patting her chest, her large eyes widened as she
                                            blinked, a picture of fear.</p>
                                        <p>Crow laughed and said: “Little sis, where did you come from? Where are your
                                            parents? It’s dangerous to come into the forest alone.”</p>
                                        <p>The black clad young lady looked at Crow, face full of surprise as she said:
                                            “Wow! Big sis, you are so tall! I have never seen a sister so tall like you,
                                            much much taller than me!” As she said that, she used her hands to motion
                                            the difference between their height.</p>
                                        <p>Crow laughed again, walking towards the girl, lifting her hands as if to pat
                                            her on the head. However, just as she was about a yard from her, her hands
                                            suddenly shot out, striking out towards the girl’s neck.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, for such a strange young lady to appear all of a sudden, how
                                            could anyone not be suspicious. Although Crow was thick-skinned [2. See 1],
                                            she was definitely not stupid. In fact, the reverse was true, with her
                                            hiding her intelligence behind a seemingly foolish appearance. With her
                                            taking action so suddenly, not only was the black clad girl caught by
                                            surprise, even the rest of the team were also taken aback.</p>
                                        <p>How strong was Crow? With her strength, even if Lin TianAo at his higher
                                            cultivation level was caught by the neck by her, he would probably not be
                                            able to resist.</p>
                                        <p>However, just as her hands were about to reach the girl’s throat, the girl
                                            seemed to slide aside like a puff of smoke. Seemingly slow, but easily
                                            sliding out of the grasp of Crow without any problems. Her large eyes seemed
                                            so innocent as they misted over, looking over at Crow with a wronged
                                            face.</p>
                                        <p>It was afternoon, and the sun was shining bright above, streaming down
                                            through the trees, bringing a gentle warmth to everyone amongst the shadow
                                            of the leaves. However, accompanying that easy sidestep of the black clad
                                            young lady, everyone’s heart was suddenly gripped by a deep chill.</p>
