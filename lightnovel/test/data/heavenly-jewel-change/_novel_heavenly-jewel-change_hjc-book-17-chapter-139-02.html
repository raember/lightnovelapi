                                        <p>In the next moment, he appeared right before Zhou Weiqing. Right where he was
                                            standing a moment ago, a terrifying-looking massive red palm imprint was on
                                            the ground, almost a whole metre deep into the ground.</p>
                                        <p>“I do not need you to save me.” Even at this point, Zhan LingTian’s enmity
                                            towards Zhou Weiqing was still high. The reason why he had just survived was
                                            because Zhou Weiqing had just recovered enough Heavenly Energy to use a
                                            Touch of Darkness Skill, forcefully dragging him back.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “A living dog is better than a dead
                                            lion, living a second longer is still better than nothing. Senior Han
                                            Tianyou, can you hear me out for just a mere line?”</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Han Tianyou did not want to rush into killing them, wanting to
                                            savour their deaths. Looking coldly at Zhou Weiqing, he said: “What do you
                                            have left to say? No matter what, it will not change all your fates.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Yet, what I am saying is totally to do
                                            with you. Indeed, your reaction was extremely quick just now, chopping off
                                            your own arm instantly and stopping the spread of my Dark Demon God
                                            Lightning Tri-Attribute Venom. However, there is something I have to warn
                                            you, this venom of mine is extremely unique… although your cultivation level
                                            is extremely high, once it enters your body, it has already spread
                                            throughout your entire body. Although the source of the venom was cut off
                                            instantly, it has already left a seed within. Before long, when it acts up
                                            again, even an immortal god will not be able to save you.”</p>
                                        <p>Han Tianyou started momentarily, then gave a cold humph, saying: “Little
                                            brat, you’re trying to scare me? Do you think I will believe you?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said calmly and unhurriedly: “It’s up to you whether or not you
                                            want to believe. However, I’m not sure if Lady Shen has told you previously
                                            about this Triple Venom of mine, and even Senior Shangguan Longyin was not
                                            able to do anything about it. To be more accurate, in this world, only I can
                                            actually get rid of this venom. If you wish to bet with your life, please do
                                            take action and kill us all. To have a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse
                                            accompany us in death, I am already satisfied.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he closed his eyes, the faint smile still on his face, the
                                            expression on his face like that of a martyr willing to face his death in a
                                            relaxed manner.</p>
                                        <p>Han Tianyou did not move, scrutinising Zhou Weiqing carefully, checking every
                                            single detail on his face and not letting go of even any slightest change.
                                            However, he was soon disappointed, as he could not sense any weakness or
                                            flaw in that impassive expression.</p>
                                        <p>No one would joke around with their own life, and though Han Tianyou was able
                                            to sacrifice his own arm ruthlessly earlier, if that arm was his neck, he
                                            would definitely not do such a thing. Who didn’t cherish their own life?
                                            Especially a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse like himself, under ordinary
                                            circumstances, living up to two hundred years old was no problem. In Han
                                            Tianyou’s eyes, all of the people right here added up together were not even
                                            as valuable as his own life! As such, he did not dare bet, not at all.</p>
                                        <p>The rest of Zhou Weiqing’s companions began to clamber up to their feet. Lin
                                            TianAo had his six-Jeweled Assembly Set Shield, and his defense capabilities
                                            were astonishing, and of all the entire party, he was the least injured.
                                            Next was the highest cultivation level, Shangguan Fei’er, she did not have
                                            any major problems as well. As for Crow and Ma Qun, though their cultivation
                                            levels were much lower, their physiques were all top notch, almost far
                                            beyond human, and though their wounds were severe, it was not up to the
                                            point where they could not even stand.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, they all gathered together and stood behind Zhou Weiqing.
                                            Towards his words, it could be said that everyone in the entire area did not
                                            know what to think of it, as it did sound rather dubious, yet with a hint of
                                            truth. No one could tell whether or not he was lying or telling the truth,
                                            not even his own companions, who were all rather startled by his words.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, they were at least smart enough to keep silent. After all, this
                                            was perhaps their last chance.</p>
                                        <p>Was there really a remaining seed of venom in Han Tianyou’s body? The answer
                                            was naturally no… the Dark Demon God Lightning might be extremely powerful,
                                            but it was not that strong with such a gap in power that a Heavenly King
                                            Stage powerhouse would be totally affected by it in an instant. Of course,
                                            Zhou Weiqing was exaggerating, making an inflammatory statement to incite
                                            fear.</p>
                                        <p>What Zhou Weiqing had grasped onto was Han Tianyou not being willing to bet
                                            with his life. With the state of things, fighting was already a lost cause,
                                            and this was truly their last hope. What he needed to do now was to induce
                                            Han Tianyou to believe him, using an excuse to help him draw out the venom
                                            and make use of the Devour Skill, and hopefully be able to control him
                                            somehow and menace the other Blood Red Hell member.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing knew clearly that the chance of this plan working was
                                            close to zero, and he hadn’t even thought it through yet. Still, at least if
                                            he tried, there would be a chance; if he did not try, they would all just
                                            die like that. Just like what he told Zhan LingTian, surviving for any
                                            additional second was just so precious, and he would grasp onto any thread
                                            of survival possible, no matter how thin it was.</p>
                                        <p>Han Tianyou’s bloodshot eyes turned to Shen Little Demon, and he asked:
                                            “Little Demon, is what he said true?”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at his terrifying eyes, Shen Little Demon couldn’t help but shiver.
                                            Although she knew that if they did not deal with today’s happenings
                                            properly, they could bring a mortal enemy of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace to
                                            the Blood Red Hell, alas things had already developed to such a point.. With
                                            Han Tianyou’s crazed emotions at this point after losing his arm, attempting
                                            to stop him was useless, and the only thing they could do was to help him
                                            cover things up to the best of their abilities.</p>
                                        <p>As such, she nodded her head and said: “At that time, Shangguan Longyin did
                                            indeed say that no one else was able to take care of the Tri Attribute Venom
                                            of his, and even the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was unable to do anything. At
                                            that point, he was the one who personally brought me to look for Zhou
                                            Weiqing to ask him to expel the venom.” As she said that, she subconsciously
                                            looked at Zhou Weiqing, who opened his eyes at that moment coincidentally.
                                            Looking at the slightly mocking eyes, she couldn’t help but stall, as she
                                            suddenly remembered how Zhou Weiqing had only agreed to save her because of
                                            Shangguan Longyin’s promise.</p>
                                        <p>Han Tianyou’s gaze, filled with killing intent, returned to Zhou Weiqing, and
                                            he snapped: “Fine. You, come here and help me expel the venom. If you dare
                                            try anything funny, I will instantly slaughter all of you.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing burst out laughing, laughing so loudly as if he had come across
                                            the funniest joke in the world.</p>
                                        <p>“What are you laughing at?” Han Tianyou took a step forward, a terrifying
                                            pressure instantly pressing down on them all, so much so that it was
                                            difficult to even breathe.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smirked coldly and said: “Senior Han Tianyou, Senior Live Hades…
                                            Please may I ask why should I help you expel the venom? If I do so, would
                                            you let us go free? I’m afraid not right? Since that is so, let us die
                                            together then. Come on, kill them all, then let me see how your torture
                                            methods are. If I, Zhou Weiqing, scream from the torture, I’m no real
                                            man.”</p>
                                        <p>“You’re asking to die!” Han Tianyou lifted his hand, preparing to slap down
                                            at him. Zhou Weiqing was not afraid at all, standing up with his hands
                                            behind his back, taking a step forward with a look of readiness on his
                                            face.</p>
                                        <p>In the end, Han Tianyou’s blood red palm stalled in midair, and he did not
                                            slap down. Although he hated Zhou Weiqing so much, he still did not want to
                                            bet with his own life.</p>
                                        <p>He did not know that currently, Zhou Weiqing’s clothes were totally soaked in
                                            sweat. Without question, if Han Tianyou’s palm were to strike down, he would
                                            have died instantly.</p>
                                        <p>“Little brat, with the current situation, do you really think there is a
                                            possibility that I will let any of you go? This also concerns the future of
                                            our Blood Red Hell, so your deaths are certain. If you are willing to expel
                                            the venom for me, I will let all of you die an easy, painless death.” Han
                                            Tianyou said coldly.</p>
                                        <p>Although his voice was still cold and filled with killing intent, his words
                                            showed that it was without a doubt that he was already starting to make a
                                            concession.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing waggled a finger at Han Tianyou and said: “No, no, Senior Han,
                                            I’m afraid that there is something you have not understood clearly. In
                                            truth, no matter whether we live or die today, everything that has happened
                                            here today will be known by the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.”</p>
                                        <p>“What did you say?” Shen Little Demon could not retain her composure and
                                            exclaimed: “You’re bullshitting. If you all die here, how could the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace know?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at her disdainfully, saying: “You have also attended the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament right? You should not be unfamiliar with the
                                            amazing Lustre Gem that the Heaven’s Expanse Palace has right? Yet, how
                                            could you mere Blood Red Hell members know how miraculous those gems are? No
                                            matter Bro Zhan or Fei’er, they are of utmost importance to the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace, they can be said to be the legacy of the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            palace. In order to ensure their safety, how could the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace not have certain safeguards in place? In fact, all that has happened
                                            here was already sent back not long ago. If you do not kill us, there is
                                            still some hope of settlement. If we all die, heh heh, if the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace does not wipe out your Blood Red Hell, Your Father, I, will
                                            take your surname.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood there, speaking calmly, totally looking like he was in
                                            control; not only did he cause the Blood red Hell members to feel fear in
                                            their hearts, even his companions felt their hearts convulsing.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the ones whose hearts convulsed the most was naturally Zhan
                                            LingTian and Shangguan Fei’er. What safeguards? What sending news? All of
                                            that was utter rubbish that Zhou Weiqing had come up with himself, and
                                            nothing like that was true. However, just looking at him speak so
                                            confidently, let alone their enemies, even Shangguan Fei’er and Zhan
                                            LingTian felt like what he said made so much sense, and that all seemed so
                                            true.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing’s famed acting skills exploded in this critical time
                                            of life and death, and he was now risking everything on it. If he could not
                                            fool the members of the Blood Red Hell, they would all die here now. If he
                                            could, they would have a slight chance of survival. In such a circumstance,
                                            how could he not lie with all his wits, finding every possible chance.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Han Tianyou’s expression turned ugly. If what
                                            Zhou Weiqing said was true, even if he killed all of these people here
                                            today, it would not be long before the masses of powerhouses from the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace descended upon the Blood Red Hell. He might be a
                                            Heavenly King Stage powerhouse, and of much rank and status in the Blood Red
                                            Hell, but even he would not be able to bear the burden of such a
                                            consequence.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and continued: “Senior Han, I know that you might
                                            not believe what I said. Let me remind you one more thing which you can
                                            definitely believe in. I believe that Senior Han’s injuries are not minor,
                                            and although you can use your Heavenly Energy to suppress it all, I’m
                                            certain it will still have not a small effect on your current strength. As
                                            Senior has seen, I have a Silver Emperor right here. Let me ask you, Senior,
                                            with your current state of injuries, and with everyone else here, who can
                                            stop my Silver Emperor if it uses its full speed with the Silver Emperor
                                            Lightning Pierce? If we are forced, we will pit all our lives to stop all of
                                            you for a split second, and I believe that we can definitely do it, and my
                                            Silver Emperor will definitely be able to send news back to the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace. As such, I have no need to lie to all of you... by now, the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace has already received news of us meeting powerful
                                            enemies here.”</p>
