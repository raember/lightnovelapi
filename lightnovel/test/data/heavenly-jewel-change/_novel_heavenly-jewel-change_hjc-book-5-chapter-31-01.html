                                            change in gear, and his original Purple Dawn Bow had been swapped for a huge
                                            black bow. The Purple Dawn Bow was already considered rather large, almost
                                            1.5m long, but the black bow he was carrying now was almost 2 metres long!
                                            It was definitely a large contrast with the small Green Spirit Bow of
                                            Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, the large black bow was given to Zhou Weiqing by Luo Ke Di.
                                            Although he loved to drink and was roguish in nature, but he definitely kept
                                            his word. However, what made Zhou Weiqing rather gloomy was that the large
                                            black bow was almost 80 jin in weight, almost four times that of the Purple
                                            Dawn Bow! The draw the bow, was not much easier than his Overlord Bow, and
                                            even with his current strong physique boosted by his Strength Physical
                                            Jewel, he still needed to circulate a bit of Heavenly Energy and release his
                                            Physical Jewel before he could draw the bow to its maximum.</p>
                                        <p>Mu En told Zhou Weiqing that the bow was called Black Dawn Bow, and was not
                                            sold anywhere. It was made from thousand year Stars Wood, and it had the
                                            greatest shooting range amongst all bows except those Consolidated
                                            Equipments. It was also good for training and building up strength,
                                            endurance and overall physique.</p>
                                        <p>Luckily, they were not traveling by foot, and as they headed out, Hua Feng
                                            brought them to a luxurious and grand looking horse carriage which was now
                                            parked outside, though Zhou Weiqing did not know when that had happened. The
                                            carriage was more than twice the size of an ordinary horse carriage, and was
                                            adorned with gilded gold and jade on the outside, with lavish decorations,
                                            seemingly a little vulgar, and it was harnessed to 4 large horses.</p>
                                        <p>Within the horse carriage, the four walls were lined with an unknown fur
                                            rugs, and the large spacious seats were almost like sofas, sitting in them
                                            felt so soft yet sturdy, and they were extremely comfortable. Such a horse
                                            carriage could even seat at least a dozen people easily and in comfort.</p>
                                        <p>“Teacher, you all are too extravagant, how much does this horse carriage
                                            cost?” Although Zhou Weiqing said that, he was practically drooling at the
                                            sight. Such a comfortable and luxurious horse carriage, if he could own it
                                            and travel the world with several beauties, that would be the best thing in
                                            the world, even though the exterior was rather overdone.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing mention the horse carriage, Mu En couldn’t help but have
                                            a indignant look on his face. “This horse carriage isn’t ours, it’s Hua
                                            Feng, that fellow’s personal property. Do you think we can sit on it for
                                            free? That miserly fellow will collect payment depending on the distance
                                            traveled, and every time we go on a mission, at least a fifth of our cuts go
                                            to him.”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng was sitting deep in the carriage, and as he heard Mu En’s words, he
                                            gave a humph. “Old scoundrel, don’t you have a conscience when you speak?
                                            Isn’t it more than worth your while to travel in my horse carriage? After
                                            all, it’s constructed out of titanium alloy, and even has a shock absorption
                                            system installed, not only is it much faster than us when traveling long
                                            distances, but its comfort allows us focus our energies on the mission
                                            itself. Furthermore, my additional cut is not just for the horse carriage
                                            fees, but also the other consumables for the mission. If you guys are
                                            willing to take charge of those, I don’t mind.”</p>
                                        <p>Mu En turned his head around in a huff, while Luo Ke Di, who was lounging
                                            back with a wine bottle in hand, said: “Enough, old scoundrel, you are your
                                            beloved disciple already conned me so much, and I, Your Father, didn’t even
                                            complain so much.”</p>
                                        <p>Mu En gave him a thwack on his head, saying: “Little Rogue, you’re the
                                            youngest here. Whose father are you?!”</p>
                                        <p>Luo Ke Di said in anger: “Bullshit, such smelly bullshit! Isn’t your disciple
                                            a human? Isn’t Boss Hua Feng’s disciple a human? Are they older than
                                            me?”</p>
                                        <p>The silent Han Mo looked coldly at Luo Ke Di and chimed in: “If you keep
                                            making noise, I’ll throw you out!”</p>
                                        <p>Luo Ke Di said exasperatedly: “It was old scoundrel who started it and
                                            taunted me. Why don’t you throw him out?”</p>
                                        <p>Han Mo said passively: “I can’t beat him, but I can beat you. A single hand
                                            cannot clap after all, and if I throw you out, that’ll be sufficient.”</p>
                                        <p>“Hmph, taking advantage of the weak and scared of the strong. Little Mo Mo,
                                            I’ll remember you.” Luo Ke Di had a gloomy look on his face as he gulped
                                            down more wine, but he quietened down.</p>
                                        <p>The horse carriage had a specialised carriage driver, who seemed to be around
                                            40 years of age with a honest look. Every four hours of travel, they would
                                            stop for a while to rest their horses, and would only travel a total of
                                            14-16 hours a day. However, Hua Feng was not exaggerating; although they
                                            were traveling long distances, sitting in this horse carriage was so
                                            comfortable that it was even an enjoyable trip. Furthermore, there was a
                                            hidden compartment under the carriage, storing a large amount of all sorts
                                            of food, drinks and arrows.</p>
                                        <p>One time, Zhou Weiqing had accidently knocked onto the walls of the carriage,
                                            and he had realised that even if he used his Overlord Bow to shoot, he might
                                            not even be able to penetrate the thick titanium alloy construction of the
                                            horse carriage. He could barely imagine how much it cost to build this horse
                                            carriage, and couldn’t help but rejoice to himself - anyway he and Bing’er
                                            did not have any cut from the mission and thus would not be reduced any
                                            further, so they naturally were having the ride for free.</p>
                                        <p>As for what the mission they were heading to do was, no one had explained it
                                            to them. The only thing that Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er knew
                                            vaguely, was that it was somewhere in the borders of the Fei Li Empire.</p>
                                        <p>In just seven days, by sitting in this luxurious horse carriage, they had
                                            reached the borders of the Heavenly Bow Empire and Fei Li Empire. As the
                                            horse carriage traveled ahead, they quickly entered a mountain valley.
                                            Although there was a road cut into the valley, it was rather small. The
                                            previous time Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er had entered Fei Li Empire,
                                            they had not traveled this path, but another even smaller road which was
                                            somewhat closer. However, with their horse carriage, they had no choice but
                                            to traverse this path which was just large enough for them to pass. At the
                                            moment, Zhou Weiqing had his eyes closed as he cultivated his Heavenly
                                            Energy. All of a sudden, he heard loud neighs as the horses reared up, along
                                            with the cries of the carriage driver, before the carriage came to a
                                            screeching halt.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng opened his eyes slowly, and without even looking outside, he said to
                                            Mu En: “Old scoundrel, business is here, you can bring Little Wei along with
                                            you.”</p>
                                        <p>Mu En’s eyes brightened, and he grinned as he said: “I will not reject such a
                                            good offer. Little Wei, come let’s go.”</p>
                                        <p>The other members revealed an indignant look, even including the normally
                                            expressionless Han Mo. Luo Ke Di gave an ingratiating look as he said to Mu
                                            En: “Old scoundrel, don’t you need some help from your buddy?”</p>
                                        <p>Mu En glared at him and said: “Help your sister… [1. A Mild curse used to
                                            disabuse him of his erroneous assumption].” To which Luo Ke Di replied with
                                            a middle finger.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was full of questions as he got off the carriage together with
                                            Mu En: “Teacher, what’s going on?”</p>
                                        <p>Mu En said with a big grin: “It’s our opportunity to make money! Hua Feng has
                                            given us a lot of face, it probably counts as a welcoming present for you.
                                            This boss of ours, he is as shrewd and astute as a devil. Why do you think
                                            he made the exterior of the horse carriage look so luxurious and vulgar?
                                            There is a reason for that.”</p>
                                        <p>Just as Mu En finished speaking, there came a loud shout from the front.
                                            “HALT! This mountain is open by me, these trees are planted by me, if you
                                            want to cross this road, leave a toll; if not, you’ll have to face death!”
                                            [2. This is a very ‘famous’ line by bandits.]</p>
                                        <p>“Bandits?” Zhou Weiqing was an intelligent person, and he quickly understood
                                            the underlying meaning behind Mu En’s words. They were unexpectedly using
                                            the luxurious horse carriage to draw the attention of bandits and robbing
                                            them in return. Such an idea… only this bunch of weirdos could come up with
                                            it…</p>
                                        <p>As the two of them exited the carriage, they saw that the front of the road
                                            had been blocked by a large group of bandits, numbering more than 20, all of
                                            whom were holding weapons. On the side of the mountains, there were another
                                            dozen or so bandits holding bows and arrows pointed at them. These bandits
                                            were all dressed in blue, and their leader was even dressed in splint mail,
                                            and they were definitely an organised group.</p>
                                        <p>The bandit leader seemed to be around 40 years of age, with a large knife
                                            held in his hands. “You guys sure have the guts to cross our Light Breeze
                                            Mountain Ridge with just a horse carriage! As the saying goes, leaving
                                            others with some space, to get some leeway in the future [3. Alright, that
                                            was very awkward. 做人留一线，日后好相见 is the idiom, and it generally means something
                                            like if you cut others some slack, they will return the favour in the future
                                            etc, with the connotations of having karma.]. If you want to live, leave
                                            half your valuables in the carriage, while the other half you can carry
                                            away. You’ll have to leave the horses and the carriage though, they now
                                            belong to I, Your Father.</p>
                                        <p>Mu En gave a miserable look, moving his trembling body forth a few steps and
                                            saying with a pleading expression: “This bandit big brother, look at us, old
                                            and young alike, without this horse carriage, how can we possibly travel!
                                            Please do us a favour, let us through please, you can have half of our
                                            belongings, but we really need the carriage.”</p>
                                        <p>The bandit leader’s face changed: “Dammit, who are you calling big brother?
                                            I, your father, will beat you to death for that! You’re older than me by at
                                            least 20 years old and you dare call me brother? Am I that old huh?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was observing from the side, and could clearly sense Mu En’s
                                            breathing grow rapid, his humble appearance changing swiftly. Zhou Weiqing
                                            grinned in his heart, knowing that his teacher hated being called old.
                                            “Little brat! Those in front are yours, I’ll take those on the side.”</p>
                                        <p>“However, leave that one for me, I want to take care of him personally. Let’s
                                            go!” Mu En was enraged by the bandit leader and didn’t want to continue
                                            acting any further.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Alright.” As he said that, he had already
                                            taken off the Black Dawn Bow from his back, swiftly circulating his Heavenly
                                            Energy and releasing his Heavenly Jewels. Nocking an arrow, he quickly drew
                                            the tough Black Dawn Bow to a full crescent, pointing it to the front.</p>
                                        <p>The bandit leader started, he had never expected this pair, one old and one
                                            young, to dare resist. “Kill them!”</p>
                                        <p>The bandits on the side of the mountain started firing their arrows, but at
                                            that moment, Mu En moved. Zhou Weiqing also released his arrow at the same
                                            time.</p>
                                        <p>*Swoosh* like a black bolt of lightning, the arrow flew out. The arrogant
                                            bandit leader felt a wave of heat pass by his ears, and a flash of pain at
                                            his earlobes, and 4 of the bandits beside him fell. The arrow pierced
                                            through the four and continued flying off into the distance.</p>
                                        <p>Even Zhou Weiqing was startled by the sheer power of the Black Dawn Bow; just
                                            counting the range and the penetrating power, it was almost as strong as his
                                            Overlord Bow.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, arrows were raining down upon them, focused on Mu En and Zhou
                                            Weiqing. Mu En moved at the same time, and before Zhou Weiqing could even
                                            see anything clearly, he saw a grey blur shimmer around him, and Mu En
                                            reappeared once more with more than 20 arrows in his hands.</p>
