                                            black colour.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian’s cultivation level and willpower was indeed strong. Even with
                                            the Triple Attribute poison and all his injuries, he had actually managed to
                                            force himself to stand up with the support of his powerful Heavenly Energy.
                                            At this moment, he was glaring at Zhou Weiqing, his eyes full of venom.</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou Weiqing.” He bit out the words viciously, before activating the Lustre
                                            Gem as well. In a flash of gold light, Zhan LingTian also vanished from the
                                            Lustre Spatial Realm.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing burst forth with that surprising and powerful Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal, dealing with Zhan LingTian and Shangguan Fei’ consecutively,
                                            the tables had turned drastically. By this point, another ZhongTian Battle
                                            Team member and a husband wife pair had all been forced to retreat from the
                                            Lustre Spatial Realm. The situation looked bleak, almost impossible, for
                                            their side, and Zhan LingTian naturally did not stay and embarrass himself
                                            further</p>
                                        <p>In truth, the ones who had been the most shocked by Zhou Weiqing were the
                                            WanShou Battle Team members.</p>
                                        <p>The WanShou Battle Team members may not speak much, but that did not mean
                                            they were stupid. Before entering the Lustre Spatial Realm, they had not
                                            seen any sign of Tian’er, obviously someone had to bring her in. Since she
                                            had jumped up from Zhou Weiqing, that in itself had spoken volumes.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er’s disappearance had caused the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord to be
                                            furious, and he had sent his men all around the Boundless Mainland in search
                                            for her, to no avail.</p>
                                        <p>When they had seen Tian’er together with this mere three-Jeweled Zhou
                                            Weiqing, they had been rather shocked, especially since Tian’er had leaped
                                            out from his bosom. That in itself left them highly puzzled. However, when
                                            Zhou Weiqing showed his power and revealed his Dragon Silencing Seal, that
                                            had truly given them a rude shock.</p>
                                        <p>What followed next had definitely proven the sheer power of that Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal. Even though it was without a doubt that Zhan LingTian and
                                            especially Shangguan Fei’er had been exhausted after their long fights, with
                                            much of their Heavenly Energy expended, they were after all still the
                                            strongest two in the entire ZhongTian Battle Team, perhaps even the top
                                            three within the entire young generation of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. For
                                            a three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master to be able to defeat both of them, to
                                            force them to leave the Lustre Spatial Realm, it could be said that Zhou
                                            Weiqing had single handedly won them the fight. If not for him, even if the
                                            Fei Li battle Team joined the fray, the tides of battle might still end up
                                            in the ZhongTian and BaoPo Battle Teams’ favour. With just the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal, his Legendary Hammers, and a few Control Skills, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had critically injured Zhan LingTian, smacked Shangguan Fei’er’s
                                            bottom, and forced the two strongest powerhouses to leave the Lustre Spatial
                                            Realm. If anyone had to guess that this little Upper Level Shi Stage
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master would be the deciding lynchpin of the entire Heavenly
                                            Jewel Tournament, to be the gem that glowed the brightest, who would have
                                            believed it?!</p>
                                        <p>The remaining members of the BaoPo and ZhongTian Battle Teams knew that there
                                            was almost no point in fighting, as they had no chance in winning any
                                            longer. Of course, they were not satisfied with such an outcome, but
                                            nonetheless, there was almost no longer any suspense about the results.</p>
                                        <p>Just as they were putting up the last resistance before the end, all of a
                                            sudden, they were all interrupted by a loud, clear dragon cry that rang out
                                            through the skies.</p>
                                        <p>The dragon cry caused the entire Lustre Spatial Realm to reverberate, ringing
                                            with exasperation, urgency and a red hot rage.</p>
                                        <p>The next moment, a massive figure appeared high up in the skies, which turned
                                            blood red along with its appearance. In mid air, a thick Fire Elemental
                                            Attribute gathered, causing everyone to feel as if they were bathed in a sea
                                            of fire.</p>
                                        <p>A body length over hundred metres. It was the huge dragon that Zhou Weiqing
                                            had seen earlier. It was also the father of the dragon egg, and the husband
                                            of the mother dragon they were fighting over. Earlier, it had been guarding
                                            by its beloved wife’s side, but there had been an abrupt change in the
                                            Lustre Spatial Realm, and it had been teleported to another area without
                                            warning. In order to seek its wife’s aura, it had wasted too much time, and
                                            by the time it successfully detected its wife’s aura, it was shocked to
                                            sense that she was already on the verge of death.</p>
                                        <p>Filled with rage, pain and regret, the male adult dragon charged forth at
                                            full speed towards where it sensed its wife was. At the same time, it could
                                            sense that there were a large number of those hated humans there as
                                            well.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, it had been those dratted humans that had forced its
                                            beloved wife into such danger. As such, as soon as it appeared, it angrily
                                            activated its Skill.</p>
                                        <p>The WanShou Battle Team and the Fei Li Battle Team were protecting and
                                            helping the mother dragon with all their might. Alas, at this time, who
                                            could speak sense to an enraged dragon?</p>
                                        <p>Gloating looks appeared in the eyes of the remaining members of the ZhongTian
                                            and BaoPo Battle Team. After all, they had already been facing a sure loss
                                            scenario, and the dragon coming in would not make things worse for them. On
                                            the other hand, it could possibly mean their opponents would lose out
                                            totally as well. <i>Since we can not gain any benefits, you guys can forget
                                                about benefiting from that mother dragon as well! </i>That was
                                            definitely the thought in their heads.</p>
                                        <p>With a mindset like this, the ZhongTian and BaoPo Battle Team members did not
                                            hesitate to activate their Lustre Gems. They definitely did not want to risk
                                            waiting for the dragon to unleash its Skill before leaving… what if the
                                            dragon’s Skill had some way of restricting Spatial Transfers, they would be
                                            left as a pile of ash. After all, that dragon was clearly a Heavenly God
                                            Stage Heavenly Beast!</p>
                                        <p>Of course, it wasn’t just them; both the Fei Li and WanShou Battle Team
                                            members did the same. Although their hearts were feeling extremely wronged
                                            and aggrieved, at this time, survival was much more important than any
                                            rewards. A continuous stream of gold lights lit up as the Lustre Gems
                                            brought contestant after contestant out of the Lustre Spatial Realm.</p>
                                        <p>“Hurry up, Weiqing, we have to leave as well. That dragon has gone crazy with
                                            rage!” Tian’er’s voice was filled with terror as she jumped right into Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s arms, and actually disappeared right into his Spatial Ring without
                                            ceremony. She needed Zhou Weiqing to bring her out of the Lustre Spatial
                                            Realm, and did not waste any time. After all, facing a Heavenly God Stage
                                            powerhouse, and an angry one to boot like the dragon in front of them, no
                                            matter who it was, they would feel an uncontrollable fear.</p>
                                        <p>With all those youthful powerhouses, all at a higher cultivation level than
                                            Zhou Weiqing, beating a hasty retreat in fear, how could he not be afraid as
                                            well?</p>
                                        <p>He was afraid, definitely. Zhou Weiqing was just as afraid, or perhaps even
                                            more. However, he had one unique attribute that no one else in that
                                            battlefield had. From young, he had always been afraid of being beaten up,
                                            afraid of dying. Whenever he made a mistake, he would have to think of how
                                            not to be beaten by his father, or perhaps have his beating lessened. As a
                                            result, before any beating, he had to calm himself down, to search via any
                                            means possible to reduce the incoming pain. Crying, wailing, acting,
                                            misdirection etc etc. This had also resulted in Zhou Weiqing being able to
                                            react extremely calmly in any situation, to put his mind to work
                                            swiftly.</p>
                                        <p>It was exactly this character that had allowed him to turn the tides in a
                                            critical moment of danger. Not once, but several times.</p>
                                        <p>When the dragon had appeared, as it was bellowing in rage and preparing to
                                            let loose a powerful Skill, even under such a huge stress situation,
                                            immeasurable pressure and fear, he could still clearly notice that the
                                            mother dragon, who had been stabilized by the efforts of the four healers,
                                            had lifted its head urgently and cried out into the skies.</p>
                                        <p>Due to her massive injuries, it was too weak and thus its voice was very
                                            soft, and many of the escaping competitors missed it. However, Zhou Weiqing
                                            still noticed that after that soft cry, the aura of the male dragon wavered
                                            a little. That was to say, the male dragon had actually heard what its mate
                                            had to say.</p>
                                        <p>The others had all left, but Zhou Weiqing decided to lay down his life for a
                                            bet. Of course, he wouldn’t joke around with his life so easily.</p>
                                        <p>Raising his Legendary Hammers into the air, the Dragon Silencing Seal’s last
                                            appearance for the day activated, as Zhou Weiqing gifted it to the huge and
                                            powerful male dragon high up in the skies.</p>
                                        <p>As the purple red light arced up into the skies, it struck the dragon firmly.
                                            Towards Absolute effect Skills like this or the Absolute Delay, even the
                                            Legendary Hammers could not boost its effect. However, it was still able to
                                            able to help boost the cast distance to reach the dragon high above.</p>
                                        <p>The massive dragon which was already unable to to stop itself from unleashing
                                            its Skill, but all of a sudden, its entire massive body was enveloped with a
                                            purple red colour. It did not have any Consolidated Equipment, but it had
                                            its own dragon race innate talents and skills. In that instance, the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal had brought about a critical use, stopping the Skill which
                                            had just been about to come out. All purple and red, the massive dragon
                                            stared down in shock from up above.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er had been right indeed. Earlier, the dragon had been mad with rage.
                                            Because of that, even though it had heard its wife’s shouts, it had still
                                            gone on stubbornly to try and kill all the humans. At this point, with its
                                            Skill suddenly disrupted, it had time to cool down from its unparalleled
                                            rage, assuaging its fury. Along with its wife urgent calls as well as
                                            sensing its wife’s life force stabilizing, the large dragon finally calmed
                                            down.</p>
                                        <p>Folding its wings back in, the massive dragon swooped down to land in the
                                            clearing in front of the cave.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was undoubtedly very nervous. The Lustre Gem was
                                            in his palm, which was soaked in cold sweat now, as his eyes locked on the
                                            massive dragon. As soon as things looked too terrible, he would instantly
                                            activate the Lustre Gem and escape.</p>
                                        <p>However, since he had already forged his path to this step, Zhou Weiqing
                                            would not give up easily until there was no other choice. He truly believed
                                            that any race had the capacity for gratitude. He and the others had saved
                                            the mother dragon, and as soon as this male dragon calmed down, he believed
                                            that it would not attack him for no reason.</p>
                                        <p>There were two reasons why Zhou Weiqing was taking such a huge risk in
                                            staying for so long. Firstly, it was for the Heavenly Jewel Tournament; by
                                            staying that long, it had allowed him to actually gain the championship of
                                            the Tournament now, as he was the only person left in the entire Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm. The second reason was because he wanted to take the risk, and
                                            to bet on the dragon; if it actually calmed down, perhaps it might actually
                                            reward him with something.</p>
                                        <p>Feeling that pity for the dying mother dragon was Zhou Weiqing’s inner
                                            kindness rising to the core; but at the same time, if there was any gain to
                                            be had, he would reject or abandon it. If the dragon was willing to reward
                                            him, that would be a legitimate gain, and he would be pleased and justified
                                            in accepting in. Such gains were something he would never reject, though it
                                            was not the basis of him helping it.</p>
                                        <p>As the Dragon swooped down closer and closer, that invisible pressure also
                                            grew stronger. Fat Cat was in his Spatial Ring, and naturally did not know
                                            what was happening outside. However, Zhou Weiqing was betting; at this
                                            point, he would not leave until the last possible second.</p>
