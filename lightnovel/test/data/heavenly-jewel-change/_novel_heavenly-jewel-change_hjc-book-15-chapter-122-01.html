                                            fight.” As she said that, she shot a fierce gaze at the Company Leader, who
                                            was once again taking the role of judge.</p>
                                        <p>“... … Begin. The fight begins now.” The poor Company Leader who had to play
                                            the role of judge once more couldn’t help but scream bitterly in his heart.
                                            However, seeing Shen Bu’s gaze rest on himself, he just stammered out that
                                            the fight had begun before retreating to the side of the stage.</p>
                                        <p>The atmosphere of the entire Duelling Corner was extremely quiet and strange.
                                            As soon as Shen Bu had ascended the stage, the entire Duelling Corner had
                                            been silenced. Besides the sounds of breathing, no other sound was
                                            heard.</p>
                                        <p>Almost as soon as the Company Leader’s words were heard, a fierce aura
                                            exploded out from Shen Bu’s body, invading towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>A violent killing intent filled with intense pressure, shoving down at Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s spirit like a falling mountain.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but show a hint of surprise on his face. He had
                                            faced many powerful opponents in his young life, including Shangguan Fei’er,
                                            Zhan LingTian, Shen Little Demon, these young elites from the Great Saint
                                            Lands. However, this young lady in front of him called Shen Bu actually gave
                                            him the strongest feeling.</p>
                                        <p>It was not to say that Shen Bu was more powerful than the other young
                                            powerhouses, but rather her presence, that imposing aura; something that
                                            none of the other young powerhouses had. Without question, this was due to
                                            her vast experience on the battlefield.</p>
                                        <p>Only one who has been forged through the blood and fires of the battlefield
                                            could have such a presence and aura about them, and without question, with
                                            such an imposing pressure,it would be very difficult for any opponent to use
                                            their full power, while she could bring her ‘A game’.</p>
                                        <p>Both sides had not yet clashed, but Zhou Weiqing had already restrained his
                                            emotions, looking at Shen Bu warily. Due to his own Demonic Change ability,
                                            he was not too afraid of Shen Bu’s intense presence, but in
                                            self-examination, he was clear that without the Demonic Change State, he was
                                            unable to give out such a killer intent and pressure like her. In
                                            comparison, Shen Yi was definitely no match for Shen Bu. Coming to this
                                            Duelling Corner, Zhou Weiqing felt excited that he had finally met an
                                            opponent here that could really threaten him.</p>
                                        <p>Along with her overpowering aura, six sets of Heavenly Jewels appeared around
                                            Shen Bu’s wrists; almost exactly the same as Shen Yi, with the Agility
                                            DragonStone Physical Jewels and Star Ruby Fire Attribute Elemental
                                            Jewels.</p>
                                        <p>A Six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master. Zhou Weiqing’s pupils narrowed. With his
                                            Four-Jeweled cultivation level, without being able to use his Demonic Change
                                            State, his God Tier Consolidated Equipment and other Attributes, could he
                                            really defeat this Upper Level Zun Stage before him? In his heart, he knew
                                            the answer was: Very Difficult.</p>
                                        <p>However, very difficult did not mean it was impossible, and he would never
                                            know for sure unless he tried! Zhou Weiqing’s character was often one who
                                            would resist harder the more he was pushed, striking back harder the harder
                                            he was struck, especially in such a fight where there was no danger of
                                            death. In the worst case scenario, he could just surrender and stay a
                                            Company Leader. As such, he would not easily reveal his many secrets, no
                                            matter his other Attributes or Consolidated Equipment, as that was just too
                                            attention drawing, and would definitely draw too much suspicion, which would
                                            be detrimental to his plan. As such, after a simple comparison of both their
                                            strengths, Zhou Weiqing resolved to just fight with his Wind Attribute
                                            powers.</p>
                                        <p>At that moment, Shen Bu burst into action. Without seeing her movements
                                            clearly, her entire body slid across, close to the ground, and in a blink of
                                            an eye, she was in front of Zhou Weiqing, her palm striking down towards his
                                            head.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was clear on how she had moved, though he had not seen it
                                            clearly. In order to move at such speed in such a stable fashion, she had to
                                            have some movement skills along with powerful leg muscles and control.</p>
                                        <p>Although Shen Bu did not use any Skills, her palm gave Zhou Weiqing the
                                            impression like a massive axe was smashing down at him. Furthermore, he
                                            could clearly sense that her aura had suddenly changed from the violent
                                            intensity to a drifting one that he could not catch easily. Without
                                            question, this palm was just a test. On the surface, Shen Bu looked like she
                                            was enraged, but when she took action, she was careful. This young lady’s
                                            willpower had been forged in the fires of the battlefield, and was tough and
                                            tenacious indeed.</p>
                                        <p>*PENG* Zhou Weiqing blocked the blow with both hands, and along with a
                                            muffled thud, he staggered back four steps before regaining his balance.
                                            This was not an act, as both their cultivation levels were almost eight
                                            stages apart, and that was not a gap that could be bridged just by pure
                                            physical strength alone. After all, as a Heavenly Jewel Master’s cultivation
                                            level grew, the difference between each stage was larger as well. For Zhou
                                            Weiqing to be able to block her blow with his Four-Jeweled cultivation
                                            level, it was already considered very impressive.l</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu gave a cold humph, not giving Zhou Weiqing a chance to recover, and
                                            struck out once more with her palm.</p>
                                        <p>A look of surprise and fright flickered on Zhou Weiqing’s face. The stage was
                                            not very large, and if he moved back any further, he would fall off. In such
                                            a state of panic, he directly somersaulted to the side, pushing himself up
                                            with his hands, agilely dodging Shen Bu’s next attack. At the same time, the
                                            Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce that had worked so well against Shen Yi was
                                            once more unleashed, and with the green blades around his arms, he struck
                                            towards Shen Bu’s legs.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu gave a cold laugh, thinking inwardly: <i>You just used this to defeat
                                            my sister, do you really think it will work against me as well? </i>No
                                            matter how strong a Skill was, one would be able to find a weak point once
                                            seen enough. In that instant, she made a judgement. This Silver Emperor
                                            Lightning Pierce was clearly Zhou Weiqing’s strongest Skill, though she did
                                            not know exactly what Skill it was.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu did not even attempt to dodge, instead her entire body went down in a
                                            half-crouch, and her hands struck out towards Zhou Weiqing’s palms. At the
                                            same time, the air turned red hot as two long four-chi blue knives of flames
                                            appeared, smashing towards Zhou Weiqing’s Silver Emperor Lightning
                                            Pierce.</p>
                                        <p>Similar Knives of Flame. It was clear that both Shen Yi and Shen Bu had
                                            Stored the same Skill. However, obviously Shen Bu’s knives, at the
                                            six-Jeweled cultivation level, were already at an unbelievable strength, far
                                            beyond the green knives of flame that Shen Yi had.</p>
                                        <p>In the ensuing massive explosion, Zhou Weiqing’s body was sent flying back in
                                            flips, the shockwave sending him far back. A surprised look crossed Shen
                                            Bu’s face, but she did not chase after him. It was not that she did not want
                                            to follow up with another attack, but in truth, the strength of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s return blow was far beyond her expectation, the Silver Emperor
                                            Lightning Pierce truly living up to its rating and catching her by surprise.
                                            Although she had still knocked Zhou Weiqing back, it was only because of the
                                            sheer cultivation difference and Heavenly Energy advantage. Yet, at the same
                                            time, the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce had broken her Flame Knives, and
                                            in order not to be injured by the strike, she was unable to pursue at this
                                            opportune moment.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, Shen Bu still charged forward after a short pause. Looking at Zhou
                                            Weiqing, her gaze was filled with disdain. <i>With just a single powerful
                                                skill, you dare to go up against me? You’re talented, but for a Low
                                                Level Zun Stage to challenge a High Level Zun Stage? Hmph!</i></p>
                                        <p>Below the stage, in the midst of the mass audience, the tall soldier who had
                                            brought Shangguan Fei’er and Zhou Weiqing into the Duelling Corner stood
                                            there, his jaw agape. He had been standing there in shock for the past few
                                            minutes, his eyes filled with disbelief. He still remembered clearly how he
                                            had mocked Zhou Weiqing earlier about thinking about challenging the
                                            advanced ringmaster. Yet… at this very moment… wasn’t that exact scene just
                                            playing out right before his eyes?!</p>
                                        <p>“Ugh! Oh crap, I forgot to tell him that to challenge the advanced
                                            ringmaster, he only needs to last for half the time for an incense joss
                                            stick to burn, then it is considered his victory and he can be promoted to
                                            the Battalion Commander position. After all, the advanced ringmaster
                                            is…”</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing could not hear the mutterings of the tall soldier
                                            below the stage, otherwise he would have definitely changed his strategy,
                                            and not reveal too much of his hand. However, at this moment, he was fully
                                            focused on the fight, fully focused on Shen Bu. When he saw Shen Bu charge
                                            towards him with the cold smile on her lips, he grinned inwardly. <i>It
                                                worked!</i></p>
                                        <p>After avoiding the remnants of Zhou Weiqing’s Silver Emperor Lightning
                                            Pierce, Shen Bu had charged forth at full speed. This time, she did not hold
                                            back at all, and her speed shot to more than twice her previous charge. She
                                            was clear that although Zhou Weiqing’s Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce was
                                            extremely powerful, he would not be able to reuse it so soon after he had
                                            just used it. As such, she had to seize this opportunity while it was in a
                                            cooldown. She had fought in wars for more than ten years, and had faced
                                            countless different foes, and she had confidence that she was able to judge
                                            an opponent’s strength well. This Zhou Little Fatty in front of her should
                                            not have any other skills to threaten her besides that strange Skill.</p>
                                        <p>As Shen Bu’s body charged along the ground, this time not only did she summon
                                            her Flame Knives, a pair of large wings made out of flame also spread out
                                            across her back, the brilliant wings almost four feet in length, lighting
                                            the entire Duelling Corner in a radiant red.</p>
                                        <p>Besides that, on Shen Bu’s body, a unique aura burst forth along with those
                                            huge wings, and a deep blue fireball started burning in her palms.</p>
                                        <p><i>Damn! Is she trying to really kill me?! </i>Zhou Weiqing turned pale in
                                            fright for real this time. He could clearly sense the terrifying power
                                            contained within that blue fireball. It was far beyond an ordinary
                                            six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master’s power; without question the wings behind
                                            Shen Bu’s back was able to boost her offense temporarily. Since she already
                                            thought he was no match for her, why use such a powerful attack?!</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing scolded her inwardly, he already started reacting. He
                                            definitely couldn’t let Shen Bu complete that Skill and allow it to explode
                                            in front of him. If that happened, even if he wanted to use his other
                                            Attribute Skills, it would be too late for him, and probably only the
                                            Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura.coudl save him then.</p>
                                        <p>Stomping his right foot on the ground savagely, a green light sprang out
                                            around Zhou Weiqing’s body at the same time, causing his speed to double
                                            instantly. It was the Tornado Strike Skill.</p>
                                        <p>The Tornado Strike Skill only worked in a straight line acceleration, though
                                            it would also greatly increase the strength of attack by at least twice. The
                                            benefits of the Skill was clear, but its drawbacks were also clear to those
                                            who knew it; as its attacking path was only in a straight line, without any
                                            way to stop, needing to charge at least ten yards before unleashing the
                                            attack.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing use the Tornado Strike Skill, Shen Bu started. In truth,
                                            she did not plan to actually use that powerful Skill in her hands to really
                                            strike Zhou Weiqing. After all, what was her rank and status? How could she
                                            possibly attack a fresh recruit like that?</p>
