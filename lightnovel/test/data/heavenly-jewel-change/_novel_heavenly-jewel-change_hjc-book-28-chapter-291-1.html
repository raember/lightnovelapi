                                            Life flames.  </p>
                                        <p>Wu Yunyue snorted coldly. He swung the Sword of the Demonic Emperor in the
                                            air; the crystal clear sword flew right out of his hand, transforming into a
                                            crystal-like ray of light, charging ruthlessly towards the black
                                            crescent-shaped Destruction blade light. </p>
                                        <p>Pssst ——</p>
                                        <p>This time, their collision did not create any loud exploding sound. When the
                                            gray and black light collided in the sky, it was akin to butter coming into
                                            contact with a hot knife, creating an odd ear-piercing sizzling sound. </p>
                                        <p>Be it the black or the gray light - both visibly melted quickly. Ultimately,
                                            both of them counteracted each other at the same time in the air. </p>
                                        <p>It was apparent who the victor and the loser were. Even though the Demonic
                                            Emperor had lost his Consolidating Weapon, and at least within a short
                                            period of time he would be unable to use the Sword of the Demonic Emperor,
                                            the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor had drained a lot more energy in
                                            comparison - he had consumed his own core essence energy. One must not
                                            underestimate that attack - if it had landed on a mountain that was less
                                            than a thousand meters tall, it would have instantly cut it into
                                            halves. </p>
                                        <p> “We concede defeat.” Fen Tian shouted as soon as both parties had
                                            collided. </p>
                                        <p>However, would Wu Yunyue stop right there? Of course not. </p>
                                        <p>While he tossed out the Sword of the Demonic Emperor, Wu Yunyue began to make
                                            his move. The Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis stealthily appeared behind the
                                            Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor. It was impossible for it to restrict his
                                            movements, but the Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis wound around from behind,
                                            causing the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s body to become slightly
                                            rigid. </p>
                                        <p>That was good enough for the Demonic Emperor. A ray of blue light wound
                                            around his legs from below; Wu Yunyue felt his body was being dragged hard,
                                            causing him to sink downwards abruptly. The moment he had sunk five meters
                                            below, he was being dragged upwards once more by a blue thread in the
                                            opposite direction. His entire being formed a polygonal line with distinct
                                            corners. </p>
                                        <p>As the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s body was becoming rigid, Wu Yunyue
                                            had already arrived before his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor was not going to sit idly,
                                            waiting for death to come. However, he was not able to dodge. At the crucial
                                            moment, the only thing he could do was to defend himself as much as
                                            possible. He thrusted both fists at the same time - erupting what was left
                                            of the Destruction Attribute without holding back at all, in a bid to resist
                                            against Wu Yunyue.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Wu Yunyue had already revealed his formidable Demonic Emperor
                                            self. Without dodging at all, and without using any skill or technique, he
                                            similarly thrusted both fists. </p>
                                        <p>The four fists collided, as a dull thud was heard, the Blood Red Hell
                                            Heavenly Emperor groaned, before his body flew out. At the same time, both
                                            arms were twisted backwards, they had already been fractured. </p>
                                        <p>At this moment, a blue thread that came from the Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis
                                            had quietly appeared. Both ends of the thread tied themselves to Wu Yunyue
                                            and the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s waists respectively. </p>
                                        <p>As the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor got flung away, the blue thread had
                                            dragged Wu Yunyue along with him. The Demonic Emperor took the opportunity
                                            to thrust his palm on the chest of his opponent as hard as he could. </p>
                                        <p>An ear-piercing exploding sound erupted in the air. The Legendary Set on the
                                            Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s body broke into pieces, scattering all
                                            over. The last layer of protection on his body had subsequently
                                            vanished. </p>
                                        <p> “Stop right there.” Fen Tian’s admission of defeat had rang out quite some
                                            time, but the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue continued to launch attacks on his
                                            opponent, as though he did not hear his voice. It was impossible for him not
                                            to be mad - his figure flashed and leapt into the sky. Terrifying
                                            Destruction will, akin to violent waves, swept towards Wu Yunyue in the
                                            sky.</p>
                                        <p> “Hell Lord, I don’t think that’s something you should do, right? Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s sluggish voice was heard. Immediately after, a layer of black
                                            curtain of light that was mixed with bright white light unfolded in the sky,
                                            obstructing Fen Tian’s Destruction will. </p>
                                        <p>The black light curtain was similar to a huge cloth. In the moment it
                                            unfolded, countless bright starlight started scattering down from the middle
                                            of it, obstructing Fen Tian’s Destruction will entirely. </p>
                                        <p>When Fen Tian’s Destruction will exploded, his entire being had already
                                            soared up into the sky. Even though his will was being obstructed, it did
                                            not stop him from flying in the sky. And as Zhou Weiqing released his Astral
                                            Celestial Territory, he had also relied on Spatial Law to arrive there. </p>
                                        <p>The Blood Red Hell versus the Peerless Sect; Fen Tian versus Zhou Weiqing.
                                            They were exchanging blows, without holding back at all, in the sky.</p>
                                        <p>Fen Tian’s Destruction Energy was different from all the other powerhouses
                                            that Zhou Weiqing had encountered, who also possessed the Destruction
                                            Attribute. If those powerhouses released the Destruction Attribute in
                                            one-faceted forms, then the Destruction Attribute released by Fen Tian could
                                            be described as countless swift knife edges. Not only was every ounce of
                                            Destruction Energy filled with Destruction aura, at the same time, it was
                                            filled with extreme destructive power, to the extent that ripples appeared
                                            within Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Celestial Territory due to its impact. </p>
                                        <p>Fen Tian’s right arm instantly swelled up the moment he rose to the sky. When
                                            he was approaching Zhou Weiqing, his arm had already become nearly doubled.
                                            His solid fist had completely turned into a dark shade of red. Also, the
                                            inner energy within the flickering ruby luster gave people a frightful
                                            feeling, as though it was going to tear the starry skies open. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing attacked Fen Tian with his leg instead of his arm - his right
                                            leg, to be specific. </p>
                                        <p>He lifted his right leg up high, like a whip, he ferociously struck Fen Tian,
                                            smashing onto his enormous fist.</p>
                                        <p>Bang ——</p>
                                        <p>The violent exploding sound that was like a bolt from the blue caused
                                            everyone on Heavenly Snow Mountain to temporarily lose their hearing. The
                                            snow that was collected near the peak of Heavenly Snow Mountain were thrown
                                            around by the violent rumbling sound before smashing hard onto the ground,
                                            causing a large amount of avalanches to roll down from all directions.</p>
                                        <p>The tyrannical collision caused everyone on the scene to be shocked. Fen Tian
                                            descended to the ground and had also withdrew all the Destruction will. When
                                            both his feet landed on the floor, his right arm had gone back to its
                                            original size, except that the part of his clothing that covered his right
                                            arm could not be restored. Everyone could clearly see that Fen Tian’s veins
                                            that were bulging on his arms were actually black in color, as though his
                                            blood was black.  </p>
                                        <p>The most powerful people, in terms of cultivation base, could clearly see
                                            that in the moment when Fen Tian’s two feet had landed to the ground, both
                                            his feet had completely submerged into the ground. That was also to say that
                                            in the process of of falling from the sky, he did not manage to counter the
                                            power from Zhou Weiqing’s leg. However, this happened within a split second.
                                            Fen Tian quickly removed his feet from beneath the ground - as though the
                                            ground was being pulled up. Based on his cultivation base, transforming the
                                            ground below his feet was an entirely easy feat. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing, who was in mid-air, rose upwards to about a hundred meters or
                                            so. Nonetheless he still looked calm and composed - he was beaming with
                                            glee. </p>
                                        <p>Were they evenly matched?</p>
                                        <p>Upon seeing what happened earlier, several spectators swallowed their saliva
                                            hard. Earlier when Zhou Weiqing just arrived and announced that the Peerless
                                            Sect was going to be a Saint Land, several people had underestimated them
                                            and waited to humiliate them. Even after the other Great Saint Lands had
                                            temporarily acknowledged the Peerless Sect as a Saint Land, several people,
                                            including Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun, felt that even though Zhou Weiqing was
                                            gifted with innate skills and that he was an outstanding powerhouses of the
                                            young generation, when it came to the Peerless Sect, he was mainly relying
                                            on the power of both the Six Ultimately Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and the
                                            Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue. </p>
                                        <p>However at this moment, everybody’s perspective had changed. </p>
                                        <p>Without a doubt, the power of the attack that Fen Tian had erupted in the sky
                                            was on the same level as a Max Level Heavenly Emperor’s attacks.
                                            Furthermore, his attack one with the Destruction Attribute as its
                                            foundation. </p>
                                        <p>However, Zhou Weiqing had managed to block his attack that easily, and had
                                            proven that he was evenly matched with Fen Tian. That was also to say that,
                                            in any case, Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base had to be at least at the Max
                                            Level Heavenly Emperor Stage. In that earlier attack, both parties were not
                                            equipped with their Consolidated Equipment Set. In everyone else’s eyes, the
                                            Peerless Sect was practically a brand new concept to them. </p>
                                        <p>Gu Yingbing looked dumbfounded at Zhou Weiqing - he was completely stunned.
                                            When he managed to finally raise his cultivation base to the Heavenly King
                                            Stage after putting it a lot of hard work, he was full of self-confidence.
                                            Upon reaching the Heavenly King Stage, it was a huge leap in terms of his
                                            power and performance. This was something that every Heavenly Jewel Master
                                            was clear about. He wanted to challenge Zhou Weiqing once again for his
                                            honor and dignity. </p>
                                        <p>However, at this moment, he had suddenly realized that apart from the fact
                                            that the difference between Zhou Weiqing and him did not become less even
                                            though his cultivation base had risen to the Heavenly King Stage, it had
                                            even became bigger - just like the huge difference between a Heavenly King
                                            and a Heavenly Zong Jewel Master, the difference between a Heavenly King and
                                            a Heavenly Emperor was extremely huge as well! He had never expected that
                                            the present Zhou Weiqing actually had the ability to challenge Fen Tian. Gu
                                            Yingbing knew that in this lifetime, it was impossible for him to contend
                                            against Zhou Weiqing, as he was not able to close the gap between them, even
                                            if it took forever. </p>
                                        <p>Right after Fen Tian descended to the ground, two thuds were heard, followed
                                            by two corpses smashing onto the ground right before their eyes. The two
                                            corpses belonged to the same person - Wu Yunyue’s opponent, the Blood Red
                                            Hell Heavenly Emperor. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing managed to obstruct Fen Tian at the right time, allowing Wu
                                            Yunyue on the other side to catch up with his opponent. The Blood Red Hell
                                            Heavenly Emperor, whose Consolidated Equipment Set had been smashed to
                                            smithereens by him, was akin to a young lady with both legs spread wide open
                                            - he no longer had the ability to defend himself. Wu Yunyue had waited for
                                            this day for too long. Each of his hand grabbed hold of each leg of the
                                            opponent, tearing him into halves in the sky.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing seemed to land at the same time as Wu Yunyue. Before he landed,
                                            he discreetly patted Wu Yunyue on the back. In the past couple of battles,
                                            Wu Yunyue had given his all, consuming large amounts of energy. Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s pure Nebula Saint Energy was his best supplement.</p>
                                        <p> “Zhou. Wei. Qing.” Fen Tian said his name with pauses in between.
                                            Overbearing killing intent swept towards the Peerless Sect.</p>
