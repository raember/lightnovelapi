                                            another flash, his arms extended, the wings behind his back flapping
                                            abruptly. Just like that he appeared again behind Yun Li, those spread arms
                                            closing together strongly, ten wind blades bursting forth from the
                                            Consolidated Claws towards Yun Li.</p>
                                        <p>Although the Blink Skill was good, one could not use it continuously, and Bai
                                            Qiu was certain that Yun Li would not be able to use the same method to
                                            dodge this new attack, enhanced with his Stored Skills.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, Yun Li was unable to dodge it. This time, his right hand waved out in
                                            front of him, and an ear splitting tearing sound rang out. A black hole in
                                            space was torn, almost one chi long. A strange sight occurred next as all
                                            ten of the wind blades were actually sucked in by the powerful suction of
                                            the black hole, and in a flash it was Yun Li’s turn to strike out at his
                                            opponent.</p>
                                        <p>The Skill that Yun Li had unleashed was the Minor Dimensional Slash, one of
                                            the powerful Skills of the Spatial Attribute. It was actually very similar
                                            to Zhou Weiqing’s Spatial Rend Skill, but it did not last as long as the
                                            Spatial Rend and its area of effect was also smaller. As a result, its
                                            Rating was only at Eight Stars.</p>
                                        <p>Bai Qiu gave a cold smirk, his body abruptly moving to the side about three
                                            chi, dodging Yun Li’s attack. At the same time, his hands moved, and a dozen
                                            wind blades formed a small tornado, striking out at Yun Li.</p>
                                        <p>Everyone watching could see that though Yun Li had the Spatial Attribute, in
                                            front of his opponent’s absolute speed, he was being suppressed.</p>
                                        <p>In the entire Geritimo Battle Team, Bai Qiu was the third ranked powerhouse.
                                            Not only did he have six-Jeweled cultivation level, his fighting experience
                                            was also rich and plentiful.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li quickly took a step back. Just as he was about to dodge that small
                                            tornado of blades, Bai Qiu had reached his back, his strike was accompanied
                                            by the shrill sound of air sliced apart and the Wind Attribute, blocking Yun
                                            Li’s path of retreat. Along with the tornado, it was a perfect pincer
                                            attack.</p>
                                        <p>In the rest house, seeing Yun Li caught in such a position, Ma Qun said
                                            worriedly: “Big Bro Yun Li looks to be in a bad position.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at him and said confidently: “In terms of control of
                                            Skills, who can compare to a Consolidating Equipment Master? He creates tons
                                            of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls every day, that is training his control.
                                            Watch and see.”</p>
                                        <p>On the stage, as if he was trying to prove Zhou Weiqing’s words, the dance of
                                            offense and defense between Yun Li and Bai Qiu suddenly changed.</p>
                                        <p>Facing a pincer attack like that, Yun Li’s left hand slapped out at the
                                            tornado. In his palm, a brilliant silver light glowed.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, he did not even turn his head to look at the incoming
                                            attack from behind. As the light grew brighter, his speed seemed to
                                            increase, and it was as if his body was being propelled from behind in a
                                            sudden burst of speed.</p>
                                        <p>Strangely enough, when that tornado with such powerful cutting powers touched
                                            the silver light around Yun Li’s hands, a soft *Puuu* rang out, and it
                                            dissipated into a cloud of green smoke. Yun Li’s body continued moving
                                            forward unobstructed right through the green cloud.</p>
                                        <p>The sudden burst of speed from Yun Li caused Bai Qiu to start momentarily.
                                            Originally, due to his success in trapping Yun Li in his pincer attack, he
                                            had relaxed slightly, and this fresh burst of speed had been faster than his
                                            expectations. In the short surprise, he was just a little too slow.</p>
                                        <p>Stopping his charge in midtrack, Yun Li abruptly spun around, his eyes
                                            glowing silver. In truth, Bai Qiu had neglected one point… Yun Li’s Physical
                                            Jewel was also that of the Agility Type, though he did not have the Wind
                                            Attribute. However, one of Yun Li’s Stored Skills was one called the Spatial
                                            Explosive Propulsion, able to increase his speed abruptly in an instant. As
                                            for the silver light in his palm, it was actually two compressed Skills,
                                            perfectly controlled with precise accuracy to use the Spatial Attribute to
                                            break apart the tornado’s structure while causing it to be unable to attack.
                                            That was the reason why Yun Li was able to escape such a disadvantageous
                                            position.</p>
                                        <p>Unknowingly, a spike appeared in Yun Li’s grasp. Still in midair, he took a
                                            step forward, and Bai Qiu who had just shook off his surprise had a
                                            foreboding premonition when he saw Yun Li disappear. Blink… clearly Yun Li’s
                                            Blink had come off cooldown and could be used again.</p>
                                        <p>Subconsciously, Bai Qiu took a step forward, ready to charge away. Since he
                                            could not see his opponent, he had to be behind. However, in that moment,
                                            his body froze abruptly for just a short instant.</p>
                                        <p>Spatial Freeze. One of the Spatial Attribute’s control Skills.</p>
                                        <p>As Bai Qiu had guessed, Yun Li was indeed behind him, and the spike in his
                                            hands struck out directly towards Bai Qiu’s back, where his heart would
                                            be.</p>
                                        <p>This Bai Qiu was no pushover either. Even in such a disadvantageous state,
                                            the Heavenly Energy within his body exploded forth, unleashing his strongest
                                            Tornado Slash Skill. His entire body forcefully spun in midair, breaking
                                            free of the Spatial Freeze. Although that sacrifice the majority of his
                                            Heavenly Energy, at least he managed to break free just before the spike
                                            reached him. With a swipe of his right hand, his glove clashed against Yun
                                            Li’s spike.</p>
                                        <p>This was the first head on clash between the two, and in the resulting
                                            explosion, Bai Qiu’s entire body was sent flying back by the powerful
                                            Heavenly Energy imbued in Yun Li’s spike.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of Heavenly Energy, Bai Qiu and Yun Li still had a certain gap.
                                            First of all, the Spatial Attribute was of a slightly higher boost to
                                            Heavenly Energy than the Wind Attribute, as it was one of the greater
                                            attributes. Even if one just compared Heavenly Energy alone, Yun Li was
                                            still ahead of Bai Qiu. Although both were at the six-Jeweled stage, Bai Qiu
                                            had just reached the stage, while Yun Li was already at the twenty seventh
                                            stage of cultivation, just one step away from his seventh Jewel. Let alone
                                            Bai Qiu having spent so much Heavenly Energy breaking free of the Spatial
                                            Freeze.</p>
                                        <p>The Spatial Attribute Heavenly Energy brought a strong tearing sensation,
                                            causing Bai Qiu’s speed to be restricted, and only then did Yun Li’s attack
                                            fully explode forth.</p>
                                        <p>The Spatial Explosive Propulsion appeared once again with a loud bang, and in
                                            a flash, Yun Li had caught up to Bai Qiu’s flying body, the spike in his
                                            hands striking once more. At the tip of the spike, a silver white light
                                            consolidated.</p>
                                        <p>Left with no choice, Bai Qiu could only gather the remnants of his Heavenly
                                            Energy, putting up his claws in a crossguard in a forced attempt to block
                                            it.</p>
                                        <p>Another ear splitting explosion. This time, the audience only saw Yun Li’s
                                            spike pierce lightly onto Bai Qiu’s hands, and with the accompanying
                                            explosion, Bai Qiu’s body was sent flying right out of the stage.</p>
                                        <p>Having defeated his opponent, Yun Li landed on the ground gracefully, a faint
                                            smile on his mouth. An opponent who had lost his balance, how could he
                                            possibly block the dual compressed Skills he had imbued on his SPike? Such a
                                            powerful and explosive attack along with his Consolidated Weapon, the
                                            destructive power could reach that of a seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that right from the beginning of the fight, Yun Li had been
                                            hiding his true strength, showing weakness to his opponent. It was a
                                            strategy he had no choice but to use. Although his Heavenly Energy was
                                            stronger than his opponent’s, he had his weak points… that was his lack of
                                            Consolidated Equipment. The only Consolidated Equipment was that single
                                            spike he used as his weapon.</p>
                                        <p>The reason was simple… his nine piece Legendary Set. Indeed, although his
                                            Legendary Set was only nine pieces, and he technically had three ‘extra’
                                            slots to use. However, that was only if he managed to reach a Heavenly God
                                            Stage cultivation level. Although Yun Li was a confident person, he had
                                            never dreamed he could breakthrough to such a stage. As such, he dared not
                                            give himself any other Consolidated Equipment, sacrificing his current
                                            strength until a time he could begin creating his Legendary Set.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, he was already very close to reaching the Zong Stage
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master. Once he reached that stage, he could begin
                                            creating the first few pieces of his Legendary Set. Even so, at this current
                                            point, he would be using a single Spike Consolidated Equipment against his
                                            opponent’s full six Consolidated Equipment. In such a circumstance, though
                                            Yun Li was still confident that they were equal in strength, he had no way
                                            of defeating his opponent easily. As a result, from the beginning he had
                                            planned to show weakness, allowing his opponent to underestimate him, and
                                            the burst forth with all his might in a critical moment. With the explosive
                                            strength of his Spatial Skills, he could force victory in a short period of
                                            time. In the end, his plan had indeed succeeded.</p>
                                        <p>“Heavenly Bow Battle Team victory. Both sides, please send up your second
                                            fighter.”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li returned victoriously, the smug look on his face could not be hidden.
                                            Zhou Weiqing sent Ma Qun on the second fight, before looking at Yun Li and
                                            giving a sigh, saying: “You should just behave yourself and stick to being
                                            an honest Consolidating Equipment Master.”</p>
                                        <p>The smug smile on Yun Li’s face froze. “Your Father, I, won this round!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a pained expression. “You can only fool that idiot. This
                                            fighting strength of yours, you haven’t improved much in these few
                                            years!”</p>
                                        <p>“Hmph” Yun Li glared at Zhou Weiqing before ignoring, sitting down at the
                                            side before saying passively: “It’s easy to make sarcastic remarks. These
                                            few years… have your Consolidating Equipment Scroll creation skills improved
                                            even a tiny bit?”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er, Crow and Xixi watched the two squabble at the side, giggling away to
                                            each other.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun had not expected that he would be dispatched to be the second fighter,
                                            and he could not contain his excitement, leaping right onto the stage. The
                                            opponent facing him there was a five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>After all, in the previous Heavenly Jewel Tournament, even the seeded teams
                                            backed by the Great Saint Lands weren’t all six-Jeweled and above. In the
                                            Geritimo Battle Team, Bai Qiu’s strength was already considered rather high.
                                            However, the first loss did not give them much cause for fear. The second
                                            fighter they dispatched was a young lady of about twenty four or twenty
                                            five. She was not exceptionally beautiful, with average features, but she
                                            had a rare steady and stable feeling about her.</p>
                                        <p>“Heavenly Bow Empire. Ma Qun.”</p>
                                        <p>“Geritimo Empire. Yuling.”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun was still wearing his Peerless Heavy Cavalry armour, and coupled with
                                            his height and stature and those massive spiked maces, facing such a
                                            small-sized lady, the visual impact was extremely stunning. Instantly, the
                                            young lady called Yuling gained the compassion of the majority of the
                                            audience, as all of them began to support her!</p>
