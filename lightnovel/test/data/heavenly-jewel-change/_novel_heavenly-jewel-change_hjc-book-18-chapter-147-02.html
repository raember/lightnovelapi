                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er took a look at the back, and since their mission was
                                            accomplished, she immediately shouted an order: “Switch!”</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion Air Force Physical Jewel Masters did not have a high
                                            cultivation level, and using their Wings to fly and the Consolidated Bow to
                                            boot was a huge toll on their Heavenly Energy. They still needed to reserve
                                            some Heavenly Energy to fly back, and in order to ensure the safety of her
                                            men, Shangguan Fei’er decided to be more conservative.</p>
                                        <p>Keeping their Consolidated Bows, the Peerless Battalion Air Force switched to
                                            the javelins on their back. Three hundred javelins rained down like metal
                                            forest. Four rounds in total.</p>
                                        <p>These javelins did not have any imbued Skills, not even any imbued Heavenly
                                            Energy, just totally dependant on their skill and strength. However, the
                                            Peerless Battalion Air Force were at least three hundred yards high in the
                                            sky, and each of these javelins weighed about than five kilograms. With that
                                            in mind, the sheer force and impact of these javelins already held an insane
                                            killing force.</p>
                                        <p>Four rounds in total, and a thousand two hundred javelins had been thrown
                                            down. Although the Swift Wolf Regiment officers were pretty strong, but
                                            facing such a rain of attacks and without their war wolves mounts, how could
                                            they take care of all of them.</p>
                                        <p>Screams rang out all around once more, with many of the wolf cavalry soldiers
                                            totally pierced through along with their war wolf mounts, pinned down to the
                                            ground as their lives fled their eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er did not stay to look at the result. As soon as the four
                                            rounds of javelins were thrown, she immediately gave the order to retreat.
                                            Their Consolidated wings flapping, the three hundred Air Force soldiers flew
                                            back towards the hillside, leaving a sea of corpses behind them.</p>
                                        <p>Butler was gnashing his teeth so hard that he almost broke them. From the
                                            start of the fight, both sides had not even met, and he had already lost
                                            forty percent of his Swift Wolf Regiment, and that was not even considering
                                            the injured. Such a massive blow, even when they had fought against the main
                                            army of the ZhongTian Empire, they had never suffered such losses.</p>
                                        <p>The feeling that the Peerless Battalion gave him could be simplified into two
                                            words. Strange… weird… Indeed, they did not seem overly powerful, or with
                                            some special unbeatable formation, just… strange...</p>
                                        <p>Such a fighting style from the Peerless Battalion was totally out of his
                                            previous experiences and expectations. Their attacks were almost
                                            unblockable, all ranged to boot.</p>
                                        <p>The Swift Wolf Regiment was definitely not weak at all, but in front of the
                                            Peerless Battalion, it felt like they had all the strength in the world yet
                                            could not use any of it. That was the most terrible feeling for a fighter
                                            indeed.</p>
                                        <p>A harsh cry emitted from Butler’s mouth. The wolfmen tribe army usually
                                            issued their orders via these howls, and with his Heavenly Energy, the long
                                            howl could be easily heard from up to ten li away. Filled with humiliation,
                                            disgrace and unwillingness, Butler gave the order to retreat.</p>
                                        <p>As the Regiment Commander of the Swift Wolf Regiment, he had to be logical
                                            and not lose himself to emotions. As such, he did not order his troops to
                                            continue charging. The Swift Wolf Regiment was just too important to his
                                            Wolfman tribe, and the entire tribe only had six such Regiments. It was
                                            because of these sixty thousand Wolf Cavalry soldiers that the Wolfman tribe
                                            was honoured as one of the greater tribes in the entire WanShou Empire.</p>
                                        <p>Although the Peerless Battalion only numbered over a thousand men, they had
                                            already given the Swift Wolf Regiment just too huge a loss. Butler could not
                                            afford to lose any more! Furthermore, these cunning enemies had retreated to
                                            the hills, and such terrain would definitely be detrimental to the Wolf
                                            Cavalry soldiers fighting prowess, instead increasing the prowess of
                                            archers. Who knew what other traps or ambushes they had in that area as
                                            well. As such, Butler had to make the painful but accurate choice, instead
                                            of ordering a berserk charge forward like he wanted. Even if he managed to
                                            wipe out these enemies, it would not bring back his lost tribesmen, and they
                                            might have to pay an even heavier price in order to accomplish that.
                                            Weighing all of that, he could only grit his teeth and bear the burden of
                                            shame, leading his Swift Wolf Regiment to encircle the area before heading
                                            off back into the distance, leaving a field of corpses behind.</p>
                                        <p>“The Swift Wolf Regiment retreated?” Zhou Weiqing stood on the hillside,
                                            looking curiously at the retreating figures of the Wolf Cavalry soldiers.
                                            This was the first true battle he had actually commandeered, and though he
                                            might seem confident and stable, only he knew that his clothes were totally
                                            drenched with sweat from both exhaustion and the sheer pressure.</p>
                                        <p>At his side, Wei Feng cried out excitedly: “Battalion Commander, we have won!
                                            We… we have actually defeated a Regiment of ten thousand Wolf Cavalry
                                            soldiers! We have won, we have won…”</p>
                                        <p>All the Peerless Battalion soldiers were dazed momentarily, before the entire
                                            hillside erupted into cheers. Every single one of them were jumping,
                                            yelling, screaming their hearts out with excitement and glee. They had won.
                                            This was the first true major victory of the Peerless Battalion. They were
                                            no longer the scared little turtles of the past, the Ruffian Battalion
                                            hiding away in the icy dredges of the north. They were now truly the
                                            Peerless Battalion, Peerless in all the lands!</p>
                                        <p>The Company Leaders of the Peerless Battalion totally forgot about Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s strength, and they swarmed forward. In the next instant, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had been tossed up in the air amidst the cheers.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, it was the arrival of this young Battalion Commander, Zhou Weiqing,
                                            which had brought them all they had today. The massive change of the
                                            Peerless Battalion had all been given by Zhou Weiqing, this unbelievable joy
                                            of victory! Not only could they eat their fill, dress warmly, no longer
                                            needing to suffer day and night… now they could have such honours as
                                            well.</p>
                                        <p>So what if they were ruffians? So what if they were scoundrels? They were
                                            still human, they still had their emotions. This victory could only spark
                                            the fire in their hearts, reinforcing a true sense of belonging to the
                                            Peerless Battalion, increasing their respect and love for this Battalion
                                            Commander of theirs, Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er also led her Peerless Battalion Air Force, which had
                                            definitely provided one of the greater contributions in the fight, to land
                                            back down safely. Looking at the soldiers who were swarming about ready to
                                            throw her up in the air as well, she did not act as usual to teach them a
                                            lesson severely, instead spreading her Consolidated Wings to escape
                                            laughingly. Everyone was filled with pride and excitement, the atmosphere
                                            infectious and spreading like wildfire. This was a victory that belonged to
                                            all of them, a pride that they had earned indeed!</p>
                                        <p>Half a year of intense training, it had undoubtedly given all of them a major
                                            boost in power, and also padded their pockets. However, sometimes profit
                                            wasn’t everything. This major victory was a true treat to their spirits and
                                            morale. The WanShou Empire Wolf Cavalry soldiers, previously seemingly
                                            invincible in their eyes, actually seemed so weak now, and the battle had
                                            proven that their hard work and training had paid off indeed, all their toil
                                            was not wasted, and this sense of accomplishment was more important than
                                            anything.</p>
                                        <p>The celebration continued for almost an hour before the dizzy Zhou Weiqing
                                            was finally allowed back on the ground. He gave the order to clear the
                                            battlefield and for a good meal to be cooked as celebration.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing had a slight sense of regret when he saw the Swift
                                            Wolf Regiment retreat earlier. After all, he still had a whole series of
                                            follow up plans against them. The Peerless Battalion could still retreat to
                                            their tunnels to recover their Heavenly Energy, and their series of tunnels
                                            had many exits. As long as they made proper use of the terrain, using
                                            guerrilla warfare to the max, he was confident in slaughtering the entire
                                            Swift Wolf Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>Butler’s wisdom and swift decision making had allowed him to keep his forces
                                            intact. Still, despite the regret, it was not a bad thing for the Peerless
                                            Battalion. At least, their underground base would still remain hidden, and
                                            there was always the possibility of using it in the future. Of course, they
                                            could no longer stay for long. They did not know if the WanShou Empire would
                                            send a larger force to take revenge.</p>
                                        <p>Still, the celebratory meal had to be eaten, and many large cauldrons were
                                            brought out and fires started. The war wolves that had been freshly killed
                                            on the battlefield would now be a delicious meal for the Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>The rich fragrance of well cooked meat wafted across the hills. The
                                            battlefield had been fully cleared, and the Swift Wolf Cavalry had left
                                            behind over four thousand one hundred corpses, as well as over two thousand
                                            war wolves. Some of the war wolves who had lost their owners had fled into
                                            the surroundings.</p>
                                        <p>Such a battle with no losses, yet the Peerless Battalion had managed to kill
                                            almost three times their own number. More so, it had been against elite
                                            forces like the Wolf Cavalry Soldiers. It could be said that this was a
                                            magnificent victory indeed.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander, how about a post battle speech for us all?” Wei Feng’s
                                            emotions were still stirred, and he looked at Zhou Weiqing with a bright
                                            look in his eyes. If not for the fact that he was already very familiar with
                                            Wei Feng, Zhou Weiqing might have mistook his sexual orientation.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood up, right beside the large flag of the Peerless
                                            Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>“Brothers, I will just say a few simple words, and will not keep you from
                                            your delicious meal for too long. This battle, we have won it beautifully.
                                            All of you are heroes, heroes of our Peerless Battalion!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s loud voice once again ignited the excitement of the Peerless
                                            Battalion soldiers, and once again, cheers filled the air.</p>
                                        <p>“You have used your arrows to show our enemies how strong we are. However,
                                            there are two things I need to declare now. Firstly, we will have to leave
                                            this place and return to the Seventh Legion as per their invitation. We will
                                            join the Seventh Legion as a separate, autonomous Battalion. All of you do
                                            not need to worry, our Peerless Battalion will not be split up, and you will
                                            always be our brothers of me, Zhou Little Fatty. Secondly, when we return to
                                            the Seventh Legion, I want everyone to keep silent about this battle.”</p>
                                        <p>“As the saying goes, If a tree grows far above the forest canopy, the wind
                                            will destroy it[1. A literal translation of the chinese idiom. The japanese
                                            version is ‘The nail that sticks out is hammered down.’ Basically meaning
                                            those who draw too much attention to themselves by being too outstanding
                                            would be oppressed by their peers.] I do not want the northern army command
                                            to know too much about our fighting capabilities too quickly. Once that
                                            happens, we will be given the most dangerous missions. As I have said many
                                            times, each and every one of our brothers’ lives are precious… priceless…
                                            and I do not want to have any needless sacrifices. Understood?”</p>
                                        <p>“Understood.” Including Wei Feng, everyone acknowledged the order.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Very good. I also have one last thing to say.
                                            Since we will be leaving for the Seventh Legion after this meal, we’ll just
                                            have meat now. However, I have also prepared five hundred jugs of good wine;
                                            when we reach the Seventh Legion and camp there, you all can drink your fill
                                            as a reward for this victory.”</p>
