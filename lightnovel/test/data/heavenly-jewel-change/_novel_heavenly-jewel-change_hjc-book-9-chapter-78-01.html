                                        <p>The ZhongTian Officiating side did not try to collect any viewing fees, but
                                            they strictly restricted anyone from placing side bets, instead having a
                                            specialised official betting ground set up by the country. How many people
                                            were there in the ZhongTian City? At least ten million, and this betting
                                            ground definitely had a huge draw; not just to the ordinary citizens, but
                                            also to nobles and the rich. This was definitely the biggest betting spree
                                            in the ZhongTian Empire, happening every three years.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, the ZhongTian Empire was pretty kind in that aspect. There was
                                            no betting allowed for the first round of the tournament. That was to allow
                                            the citizens to have a basic understanding of the teams in order to better
                                            place their bets. The first bet was from this second round onwards. As such,
                                            there were even more people here to watch as compared to the first round,
                                            the entire Plaza crowded, and even all the way to the heart of the city. In
                                            order to maintain safety, the officials had stationed several hundreds of
                                            soldiers all around to maintain order. There were almost three thousand
                                            betting stations spread around the entire ZhongTian City, allowing ease of
                                            access to place bets.</p>
                                        <p>In fact, there were betting stations all around the ZhongTian Empire, not
                                            just in the ZhongTian City!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing, Lin TianAo, Crow and Ye Paopao left the inn very early. As soon
                                            as they knew that the betting stations were open, everyone unhesitatingly
                                            took out all their savings and placed a bet on themselves.</p>
                                        <p>Today, the Fei Li Battle Team’s opponent was the Tiecheng Battle Team, and
                                            the odds on the Fei Li Battle Team was 1 to 1.3, and the odds on the
                                            Tiecheng Battle Team was 1 to 3. That was to say, if you bet ten gold coins
                                            on the Fei Li Battle Team and won, you would get back thirteen gold coins,
                                            with a profit of three; if you bet on the Tiecheng Battle Team and won, the
                                            return would be thirty gold coins, with a profit of twenty!</p>
                                        <p>From a certain perspective, the difference in odds was also the perceived
                                            difference in the teams’ strengths.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had sold all of his remaining Mid Level Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls in order to scrounge out as much money as possible, managing to get
                                            four hundred thousand gold coins. That was the advantage of being a
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master; after a certain level he would never be
                                            lacking gold coins.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to Zhou Weiqing, the rest were not so rich. Besides Ye Paopao,
                                            the rest of them added together had barely reached two hundred thousand gold
                                            coins. Of course, Ye Paopao, as the Premier’s son, had casually taken out
                                            five hundred thouand gold coins!</p>
                                        <p>The competitors had their own betting station, right beside the tournament
                                            area, and they did not need to queue up like the rest of the citizens. The
                                            team members placed their bets and headed over to their resting house.</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao said rather gloomily: “If I had known about the bet, I should have
                                            brought more money. I only brought five hundred thousand.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo glanced at him speechlessly before finally saying: “You’re
                                            complaining that five hundred thousand is too little? I only brought twenty
                                            thousand gold coins, and that’s my life savings, most of which was all the
                                            prizes and awards that I had worked hard for from the academy. You nobles...
                                            the well fed truly do not know how the starving suffer.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not place much thought on the bet. Although money was
                                            important, the tournament and the fight itself was now much more important
                                            to him. With a rare look of serious concentration, he said: “Today, I’ll be
                                            the first one to fight.” With his physique and recuperation rate, he had
                                            mostly recovered from his training, and in that time the swell on his face
                                            had also subsided.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo nodded and said: “Alright, you fight first, Crow second. Let’s
                                            look at the results of the first two fights first before we decide who to
                                            fight in the third round of 2v2. I’ll only be taking action if absolutely
                                            necessary.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing asked: “Leader, how much have you recovered?”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo said: “I’ve recovered about eighty percent of my power. Although
                                            that day I was severely injured, I was still in better shape than Drunken
                                            Bao. Little Four was just exhausted, and he should also be recovering soon.
                                            Drunken Bao is probably at seventy percent, but Xiao Yan isn’t doing too
                                            well. After all, he had drained his life force quite severely, and he’s
                                            currently only at barely sixty percent. The next round, we’ll be facing the
                                            Bai Da Empire, and if possible we should try not to let him and Drunken Bao
                                            fight.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded in agreement before closing his eyes. Facing the fight in
                                            front of him, he was extremely calm, sitting there as if without a care in
                                            the world, not interested in the other fights starting out in front of him
                                            as he continued to immerse himself in the understanding of the Spatial Rend
                                            that he had been rewarded with after the two days of intense training. He
                                            was preparing himself for the fight ahead in his own way, bringing his
                                            status to maximum. No matter who his opponent was today, even if it was
                                            another five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master again, he would no longer
                                            retreat. He believed that Shangguan Tianyue would definitely send someone to
                                            monitor him and his progress, and he wanted to prove himself to his future
                                            father in law, that he had the power to marry Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>As a loud cheer arose from the audience, the second day of the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament finally started.</p>
                                        <p>Just like the first day, the first fights were all the seeded teams.
                                            Similarly, all their opponents chose to surrender without a fight once
                                            more.</p>
                                        <p>During the preliminary heats, the official betting system had a unique method
                                            of dealing with the seeded teams. First of all, during this period, the team
                                            facing the seeded team had to decide if they wanted to surrender or not.
                                            Outsiders could only bet whether or not they would surrender or not, with a
                                            1 to 2 odds. Of course, the attending team could not bet on this themselves;
                                            if they tried to profit from this, not only would they be disqualified from
                                            the tournament, they would also be blacklisted and no longer allowed in
                                            future tournaments. No Empire would risk such a result for a mere profit
                                            from a single betting round, let alone risk offending the ZhongTian Empire
                                            and possible worse repercussions.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, if the team actually chose not to surrender, and to fight, the bet
                                            would change. The odds on the seeded team would be a mere 1 to 0.001, while
                                            the opposing team would be a 1 to 100 bet! That was to say, even if one bet
                                            on the seeded team and won, a thousand gold coins would only earn him a
                                            single gold coins. With such a rate, hardly anyone would choose to bet on
                                            them. In fact, many would even place a small amount on the non seeded team
                                            in such a case. After all, with a 1 to 100 odds, just a small bet could net
                                            them a tidy profit!</p>
                                        <p>Of course, such a strange method of betting was only for the preliminary
                                            heats. Once the tournament entered the top eight, the odds would be
                                            rearranged accordingly.</p>
                                        <p>The tournament continued steadily and fight after fight went on. The various
                                            teams and members were all the elite of their empires, and they all fought
                                            to their best efforts. From the first round up til now, not a single dark
                                            horse had appeared as the fights went on. BY the time it was time for the
                                            third group, and the Fei Li Battle Team to fight, it was already almost
                                            noon. It was also the last fight of the morning, and there would be a period
                                            of rest before the remaining fights resumed in the afternoon.</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, it’s our turn.” Lin TianAo patted Zhou Weiqing on the shoulder.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes, standing up from his seat and stretching
                                            himself before heading to the stage.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at his back, Lin TianAo suddenly felt a strange sensation. That day
                                            after Shangguan Bing’er had been taken away by her family, Zhou Weiqing
                                            seemed to have changed totally, especially in terms of his disposition. In
                                            the past, he had always been cheeky, mischievous even, treating things very
                                            light heartedly. Yet now, he seemed extremely solemn and steady. Amongst the
                                            entire team, Lin TianAo was perhaps the only one who truly knew how powerful
                                            Zhou Weiqing was. After all, he had seen Zhou Weiqing’s Alexandrite Cat’s
                                            Eye! Not only that, he had a God Tier Consolidated Equipment. Let alone
                                            three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters, even four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters would be hard pressed to defeat him. As long as he did not face a
                                            five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, Zhou Weiqing had a high chance of
                                            winning. Of course, even against five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters, the
                                            type Zhou Weiqing was afraid of the most was the defensive type ones like
                                            Lin TianAo; as the difference in Heavenly Energy was too great.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing walked slowly up the stage, and by the time he ascended, his
                                            opponent was already standing there.</p>
                                        <p>“Fei Li Battle Team, Zhou Weiqing.”</p>
                                        <p>“Tiecheng Battle Team, Lichuan.”</p>
                                        <p>With the proclamation from the judge, the fight started.</p>
                                        <p>Four Waxy Jade Physical Jewels appeared around wrist of the youth called
                                            Licheng. He was of medium build, looking about twenty or so of age. As soon
                                            as the judge’s shout to begin came out, he charged forward, as if sliding
                                            across the ground right towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>In the first day, Zhou Weiqing did not watch any other fights, but that did
                                            not mean that others did not watch his, or take notice of him. Although they
                                            had lost in the 2v2 fight, in the Tiecheng Battle Team, his contributions
                                            were not to be ignored though he was only of the three-Jeweled cultivation
                                            level. His archery had played an extremely important role as well. As such,
                                            as soon as Lichuan saw that his opponent was Zhou Weiqing, he did not
                                            hesitate and immediately decided to go for close combat. He was after all
                                            with the Flexibility Attribute, and he was best in close combat. Naturally,
                                            he would choose his strongest point, which he also thought was Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s weak point.</p>
                                        <p>As he charged forward, Lichuan’s left hand also lifted up in Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            direction at the same time, and seven Wind Blades flew out towards him. In
                                            mid air, the Wind Blades actually split apart, like a flower splitting apart
                                            into separate petals, flying in seven different arcs as they sped towards
                                            Zhou Weiqing in tricky angles.</p>
                                        <p>This was superb control over his Elemental Jewel Stored Skills, and to have
                                            such control, it showed that Lichuan had definitely spent much time and
                                            effort on this low level Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er were relatively weaker in terms of their
                                            Stored Skills and their control and usage of them. That was because in their
                                            time in the Heavenly Bow Unit, they had been focused on training with their
                                            archery. In the two years, they had learnt many amazing archery skills and
                                            assassination techniques. After all, none of the Heavenly Bow Unit members
                                            were Heavenly Jewel Masters, and in terms of Heavenly Jewel Master
                                            techniques, they were unable to give much teaching or advice.</p>
                                        <p>If it were the Zhou Weiqing of three days ago, facing such an attack, he
                                            would probably have to use the Blink to dodge the Wind Blades, following
                                            with an attack, making use of his superior number and quality of skills to
                                            suppress the enemy, perhaps winning with his Control Skills.</p>
                                        <p>However, the current Zhou Weiqing was no longer that Zhou Weiqing. The three
                                            days of learning and understanding had not just given him a much better
                                            understanding of the Spatial Rend Skill, but also in terms of control over
                                            skills.</p>
                                        <p>In the next instant, his left hand drew a small circle in the air, and a dim
                                            flash of silver lit up, as a black circle enveloped in silver light appeared
                                            in his palm.</p>
                                        <p></p>
