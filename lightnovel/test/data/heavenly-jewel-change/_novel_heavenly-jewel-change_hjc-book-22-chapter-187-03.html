                                        <p><i>However, his wounds had just barely recovered slightly, would cultivating
                                            now affect him? </i>Unknowingly, Shangguan Xue’er did not even realise that
                                            the hatred in her heart towards Zhou Weiqing had vanished, and she was
                                            instead filled with anxiety and worry. Her character was after all quite
                                            different from Shangguan Fei’er’s, and the burden on her shoulders was also
                                            far greater. Furthermore, she had a psychological barrier and burden due to
                                            her sisters falling for Zhou Weiqing first. Every time she thought about
                                            what happened between Zhou Weiqing and herself, she would feel extremely
                                            weird, as if she were trying to steal her sisters’ man.</p>
                                        <p><i>Forget it, I shall not think about it any more for now.</i> Shangguan
                                            Xue’er returned to her tent and started writing a letter to her uncle, the
                                            Emperor of the ZhongTian Empire, Shangguan Tianxing. As for the relationship
                                            between her and Zhou Weiqing, she currently just wanted some distance from
                                            him. Although she had agreed to marry him, she had not stated a date… at
                                            most, she could just refrain from marrying the rest of her life…</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Time passed just like that, day after day. Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er spent
                                            most of their time cultivating; once they entered the deep meditative state,
                                            they would almost forget the time outside, usually staying in a cultivation
                                            trance for three days or more at one go.</p>
                                        <p>On the surface, they did not have much feeling about that. However, every
                                            time a training session ended, both of them were pleasantly surprised to
                                            sense the sheer growth in their Heavenly Energy. Another area of marked
                                            improvement was in their degree of compatibility, unity and integration.</p>
                                        <p>In this matter, Zhou Weiqing’s improvements were even more obvious than
                                            Tian’er. Firstly, he had the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, and his bloodline
                                            was even more superior than Tian’er, and his growth was thus faster.
                                            Secondly, he was leading force during their cultivation, and his cultivation
                                            level was still currently lower than Tian’er’s. With all those factors
                                            combined, it was no surprise that his improvement was faster than
                                            Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, there were some things that Shangguan Xue’er did not know of. For
                                            example, after a round of training with the Four Saint Attributes, they
                                            would subconsciously have a bout of intimate relations, causing the training
                                            to become even more perfect… Of course, that would be the reason if Zhou
                                            Weiqing were the one to describe it. If Tian’er were to describe, it would
                                            be that ‘a certain person’ would not be able to control himself shamelessly
                                            after every cultivation, and would make use of the excuse of ‘completing
                                            their training’......</p>
                                        <p>In any case, while they were focused in training, time passed swiftly, and
                                            soon a month had passed. The Heaven’s Expanse Palace and ZhongTian Empire
                                            had both replied Shangguan Xue’er with a clear-cut answer. By the third
                                            week, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had stopped cultivating, and started to
                                            prepare for their trip. At this point, it was almost time for them to head
                                            out.</p>
                                        <p>This time, as they set off for the Fei Li Empire, Zhou Weiqing brought the
                                            five hundred men from the First Main Company, as well as Shangguan Xue’er
                                            and Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>He had originally wanted to bring only one of the two ladies, but did he dare
                                            do such a thing? Of course not! Otherwise, he would be in big trouble! Left
                                            with no choice, he could only bring both of them.</p>
                                        <p>Besides Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er, after some consideration, Zhou Weiqing
                                            also decided to bring Lin TianAo along. The reason was simple, his pure
                                            ultimate defense was that powerful, and combined with Zhou Weiqing’s Six
                                            Ultimate Godly Light Formation, it would allow him to unleash his offensive
                                            capabilities to the max. As for the coordination of outfitting equipment and
                                            training which had been Lin TianAo’s primary responsibility, it was
                                            temporarily passed to Little Four and Drunken Bao. All this time, both of
                                            them had been helping Lin TianAo with the matter, so it was not too
                                            difficult for them to take over.</p>
                                        <p>Besides that, there was also Crow and Ma Qun coming along. Originally, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had only wanted them to bring fifty elites from each of their
                                            individual tribes. However, the final decision was to bring a hundred elites
                                            each. This decision was not Zhou Weiqing’s, or even the two of them, but by
                                            the two Tribe Leaders. After all, Zhou Weiqing’s safety could be said to be
                                            of paramount importance to the entire Peerless Battalion, not to mention the
                                            two heirs of the tribes were also going along.</p>
                                        <p>As such, the large party of seven hundred moved out, almost a fifth of the
                                            entire Peerless Battalion’s strength. Furthermore, these were definitely the
                                            cream of the crop amongst all the elites of the Peerless Battalion. Led by
                                            Zhou Weiqing, they struck off towards the Northwest Army camp. After all,
                                            they had to return to the ZhongTian Empire in order to reach the Fei Li
                                            Empire. As for the ZhongTian Empire, they had already sent word to the Fei
                                            Li Empire regarding the diplomatic visit of the Heavenly Bow Empire, showing
                                            their support. This was arranged by Shangguan Xue’er and the ZhongTian
                                            Empire.</p>
                                        <p>Towards the Peerless Battalion, the ZhongTian Empire was extremely
                                            supportive.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion had truly shown their power in the fight against the
                                            WanShou Empire armies during this year’s border wars. However, to the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace, what they saw was not just the result of a single
                                            border war, but the potential that Zhou Weiqing had.</p>
                                        <p>Before this war, they had already seen the vast individual talent and
                                            potential that Zhou Weiqing had. However, after the Peerless Battalion’s
                                            showing, they truly understood Zhou Weiqing’s boundless potential was not
                                            restricted to his individual strength.</p>
                                        <p>If it were just one person, no matter how powerful he was, he was still a
                                            single person. However, Zhou Weiqing’s inborn leadership qualities and
                                            unrestrained and creative styles of thinking… that was something that the
                                            Shangguan brothers truly admired.</p>
                                        <p>To be able to form such a powerful army from a mere group of ruffians…
                                            although a large amount of that was a massive amount of wealth that Zhou
                                            Weiqing had accumulated, further supported by the Six Ultimate Heavenly
                                            Emperor, but without proper command, leadership and his various amazing
                                            ideas, none of this could have succeeded.</p>
                                        <p>Even though Zhou Weiqing had not indicated that the Peerless Battalion would
                                            join the ZhongTian Empire, even wanting to bring the Peerless Battalion away
                                            to the Heavenly Bow Empire, their training methods could still be
                                            duplicated! They only needed to do some slight modifications, and the
                                            ZhongTian Empire could possibly train a similar, new powerful unit. After
                                            all, in terms of wealth, how could Zhou Weiqing compared with the entire
                                            ZhongTian Empire! Furthermore, even his creation of the Peerless Battalion
                                            had been done with a lot of help from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
                                        <p>When Shangguan Fei’er had returned to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she had
                                            been requested to detail the training program of the Peerless Battalion.
                                            This was something that Zhou Weiqing did not know of.</p>
                                        <p>As such, when the three Shangguan brothers had received Shangguan Xue’er’s
                                            letter, after a simple discussion, they decided to back Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            efforts in restoring his homeland.</p>
                                        <p>They had all seen Zhou Weiqing’s immense potential, let alone now with the
                                            Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya behind his back. With all these
                                            factors in mind, supporting Zhou Weiqing was an investment that could only
                                            lead to benefits, and with no harm to them. Furthermore, they did not even
                                            have to expend anything, not even needing to send out any other troops or
                                            logistics, as they would not be actually fighting on his behalf, just using
                                            their words to pave the way for him. They would allow Zhou Weiqing to fight
                                            as he willed, and this would be also another way to further test his
                                            potential. As such, to a certain extent, they would continue supporting Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>In the recent times, it was not just the northern borders which had broke
                                            into war. Even the Dan Dun Empire and the Bai Da Empire seemed to be
                                            stockpiling and preparing for something; and the Blood Red Hell seemed to be
                                            plotting something. In fact, there seemed to be something brewing up in the
                                            entire South.</p>
                                        <p>Normally, the focus of the ZhongTian Empire armies were more towards their
                                            northern borders, and they would not want to see problems occurring to the
                                            south. With Zhou Weiqing stirring things up there with his Peerless
                                            Battalion, who could foresee what would happen in the future? Of course,
                                            with chaos came opportunity, and who knew what achievements he could
                                            accomplish? After all, before he came to the northern borders, who could
                                            have imagined he would build something like the Peerless Battalion?!</p>
                                        <p>As such, the ZhongTian Empire acted swiftly, and in less than a month, all
                                            the preparations had been complete as per Zhou Weiqing’s arrangements. The
                                            Northwest Army Camp had also received the order that no matter what the
                                            Peerless Battalion’s movements were, they would support it. With such an
                                            order present, the Peerless Battalion could easily leave and head out to
                                            wherever they needed to.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing was mounted upon his single-horned Ghost Demon Horse,
                                            with Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er each to the side of him. Shangguan Xue’er
                                            was still with a cold, impassive bearing, while Tian’er would glance towards
                                            Zhou Weiqing from time to time. Occassionally, if she looked at Shangguan
                                            Xue’er, she would immediately lift her head proudly, giving a disdainful
                                            expression.</p>
                                        <p>In their month of cultivation, Tian’er and Shangguan Xue’er had barely spoken
                                            at all. Luckily, the two girls were able to control themselves, and at least
                                            they did not break into a fight - that was already giving Zhou Weiqing a lot
                                            of face. After Zhou Weiqing’s explanation, Tian’er had already learned that
                                            it was Shangguan Xue’er, not Shangguan Fei’er. Towards her Little Fatty’s
                                            philandering ways, Tian’er was actually the most accepting of it. After all,
                                            in the Heavenly Snow Mountain, or perhaps the WanShou Empire, it was a very
                                            common sight. The more powerful one was, the more wives or concubines they
                                            would have. Even her father, the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, had many
                                            concubines, though he had only taken one wife, the Entropic Nether Tiger
                                            Phelia. At the same time, he would not have any children with his other
                                            concubines, using them only to sate his physical needs.</p>
                                        <p>However, accepting was one matter, but Tian’er would not back down on her on
                                            position. Besides Shangguan Bing’er who she knew could never be replaced in
                                            Little Fatty’s eyes, she would never back down from anyone else. After all,
                                            Shangguan Bing’er was Zhou Weiqing’s first woman, and the one he loved the
                                            most. Furthermore, her character, her gentleness and kindness, that was
                                            something Tian’er had seen and approved of. However, this Shangguan Xue’er
                                            was always so cold and impassive, added on to the fact that the two ladies
                                            represented the two opposing Great Saint Lands, it was natural that they did
                                            not have a harmonious relationship.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had already grown used to that atmosphere between them.
                                            Currently, he ignored them both, his gaze landing on the seven hundred
                                            Peerless Battalion warriors in front of him.</p>
                                        <p>There was little more to be said about the five hundred men of the First Main
                                            Company. These five hundred had gone through countless screenings and
                                            competitions, trials and tribulations before they had finally been together
                                            as the First Main Company. In the Peerless Battalion, there were always
                                            various competitions, duels, discussions and more, both individually and
                                            between Main Companies. Those who had constant outstanding performances
                                            would eventually be transferred to the First Main Company, and it was truly
                                            the elites amongst the elites. They also shouldered the greatest
                                            responsibilities on the battlefield.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst the current First Main Company warriors, there were actually more
                                            than twenty Heavenly Jewel Masters. Furthermore, all five hundred of them
                                            were equipped with Consolidated Wings, and the average cultivation level of
                                            them were at the five-Jeweled stage or higher. Of course, that was mainly
                                            the Physical Jewel Masters, not the Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, having an average of five-Jeweled Physical Jewel Masters for an
                                            entire Main Company, that was already a shocking phenomenon. Under such a
                                            circumstance, one could just imagine their sheer combat prowess.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, each and every one of the First Main Company soldiers had been
                                            issued a Unicorn Heavenly Beast as their mounts. After all, during the
                                            border wars, the Berserker Tribe had focused their attentions on capturing
                                            these powerful beasts, and had succeeded in capturing a large number. Even
                                            though both tribes had taken on the majority of the Heavenly Beasts, there
                                            were still sufficient remaining, and naturally the First Main Company had
                                            first pick.</p>
