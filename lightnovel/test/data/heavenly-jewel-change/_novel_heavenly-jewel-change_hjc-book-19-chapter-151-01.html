                                            about her, coming from all directions, making her feel as if she could not
                                            breath. However, that pressure was actually self inflicted. That Zhou
                                            Weiqing fellow was already so disgusting, and his teacher was actually also
                                            in the army camp. Although he was dressed in an ordinary army uniform,
                                            looking in disarray, the waistline of his pants stretched to its maximum
                                            limit… still, he was still Zhou Weiqing’s teacher!</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya walked over to Zhou Weiqing’s side before tilting his head. His
                                            eyes still seemed a little drowsy from drink; clearly he had not used his
                                            Heavenly Energy to detoxicate himself.</p>
                                        <p>“Ehh, isn’t that the little brat Green Wolf? He was still drinking happily
                                            with me last night, and Your Father, I, managed to drink him under the
                                            table. Why is he laying here pretending to be dead?”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, Long Shiya bent down and grabbed hold of Green Wolf.</p>
                                        <p>“Teacher, Green Wolf is critically injured. You…” Zhou Weiqing hurriedly
                                            said. However, before he could complete his sentence, his eyes widened.</p>
                                        <p>As Green Wolf was hoisted up, a layer of dim gold light sprang about his
                                            entire body. Atop his head, an illusory looking gold symbol formed out of
                                            the gold light, looking like an extremely cute little angel. The next
                                            moment, Green Wolf’s entire body seemed to turn gold in colour, as if
                                            someone had painted his entire body with gold paint.</p>
                                        <p>“Aiiiyyyaaah, that hurts so bad!” Green Wolf’s cry of pain suddenly rang
                                            out.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya’s other hand clapped down on his chest before puling back, looking
                                            rather clumsy as he did so. However, that caved-in chest of Green Wolf’s
                                            seemed to puff back out, and under the cover of the gold light, his entire
                                            body started to tremble and shake.</p>
                                        <p>“Tonight, remember to come and accompany this old man to drink again.” Long
                                            Shiya flicked his wrist, and Green Wolf stumbled and reeled to the back.
                                            However, a miracle occurred as Green Wolf stumbled… Originally on the verge
                                            of death, he suddenly recovered his balance and stood up tall. His own face
                                            was a mask of surprise, but no matter how they looked at him, he did not
                                            look like he had been on his last breath just moments ago. If not for the
                                            fact there was still blood at his lips, no one would believe that this
                                            fellow had been injured at all.</p>
                                        <p>“Master, you’re too great!” Zhou Weiqing was overjoyed. At this moment, he
                                            truly felt like jumping over to hug his teacher and give him a kiss. In
                                            truth, he was also in a tough dilemma, having ridden a tiger and was now
                                            finding it hard to get off[1. Literal translation, basically in a tough
                                            position]. Previously, he had been in such a rage, and he could not easily
                                            take back those savage words; otherwise he would lose all credibility in
                                            front of his Peerless Battalion brothers.</p>
                                        <p>However, if they really took action against the Sixteenth Regiment, although
                                            they would not have any problems taking them down, that would also mean the
                                            end of them being able to stay in the northern army camp. That would be a
                                            huge blow to Zhou Weiqing’s original plan. At the same time, he did not have
                                            any time for regrets, and could only hope that Shen Bu would give in.
                                            However, his own demands were extremely harsh and severe, and it was
                                            unlikely that she would do so.</p>
                                        <p>Now, Long Shiya and Mu En’s appearance could be said to be at a perfect
                                            moment. With a single easy action, Long Shiya had healed green Wolf.
                                            Ignoring the stunningly frightening power he showed, just the fact that
                                            Green Wolf would live meant that the greatest conflict between both sides
                                            had been resolved… and there was a chance for a favourable turn to
                                            events.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander.” Green Wolf looked towards Zhou Weiqing. Such a tall
                                            stout man like him, but his eyes reddened in that moment. He had known of
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s arrival, and had also heard all his words clearly, though he
                                            had not been able to speak due to his injuries. He had never expected that
                                            Zhou Weiqing would go far with the Sixteenth Regiment for his sake.</p>
                                        <p>Being a ruffian or scoundrel did not mean that they did not have feelings,
                                            just that perhaps they were much better at hiding their feelings than
                                            ordinary people, masking it under their surface cunning or violence.
                                            However, once such people actually opened their hearts, they would
                                            undoubtedly be much stronger than ordinary.</p>
                                        <p>In that instance, Green Wolf looked to Zhou Weiqing totally as his true big
                                            brother… no matter that his own age was actually higher than Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, if Zhou Weiqing were to send him to his death, he would do so
                                            unhesitatingly. A gentleman would die for a patron who recognizes his worth,
                                            a scholar would die for his bosom friend [1. Direct translation, but the
                                            meaning should be pretty clear] These words were a perfect description of
                                            Green Wolf’s current feelings.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glared at him exasperatedly. “You useless bum, can you do things
                                            properly? Losing a fight and almost being beaten to death… if you lose don’t
                                            you know how to call for help?! Or run?! Tcheh, go back there, I’ll deal
                                            with you after we settle this over here.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes, yes, Battalion Commander, this old wolf will take any punishment. In
                                            the future, this life of mine is yours, absolutely loyal to the core.[2. The
                                            words he used could also be used to describe a woman’s loyalty to her
                                            husband, hence the next line]”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing almost burst out laughing, the tightened muscles of his face
                                            couldn’t help but twitch as he restrained himself. “Loyalty your head! Your
                                            Father, I, do not love men that way! Get lost!”</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he said that, the Peerless Battalion soldiers, who had been full
                                            of anger, all burst out laughing. Green Wolf also turned red in
                                            embarrassment, though his heart was also filled with gratitude, as if being
                                            scolded by Zhou Weiqing was an honour. He quickly turned and ran to the
                                            back.</p>
                                        <p>“Wait…” Zhou Weiqing called him back. “You fool, who just saved your
                                            life?!”</p>
                                        <p>Only then did Green Wolf react. He was after all an intelligent man, and he
                                            suddenly knelt down towards Long Shiya and kowtowed down. “Thank you, sire,
                                            for saving my life.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya laughed heartily and said: “Get up… just come accompany this old
                                            man drinking at night. Look at how you seem now, so useless, what are you
                                            kneeling for.”</p>
                                        <p>Green Wolf grinned and made a wine-drinking action at Long Shiya before
                                            hastily running off to the back.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng had been looking on at the side, and he saw that the opportune time
                                            had come. As the Vice Battalion Commander, he was clear that it was a good
                                            time for him to step forward in a mediating role. After all, now that there
                                            was an excuse, it would be a good thing for both sides to step back…
                                            otherwise would they really slaughter the entire Sixteenth Regiment
                                            party?</p>
                                        <p>“What are you all doing? Aren’t you tired of drawing your bows for so long?
                                            Settle down first, wait and see.” Wei Feng said exasperatedly to the men.
                                            His words were naturally designed to ease up the atmosphere, but also to
                                            show to the Sixteenth Regiment that though they were taking a step back,
                                            this matter was not finished yet.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a hurried galloping sound could be heard in the near
                                            distance. Hearing the sound, Zhou Weiqing heaved a sigh of relief inwardly.
                                            He knew that they would not actually end up fighting for real after all.
                                            Lifting his leg, he gave a kick and sent the Heavy Cavalry Battalion
                                            Commander back in front of Shen Bu. That fellow had been nearly fully
                                            drained by Zhou Weiqing’s Devour Skill, and he just lay there unmoving. If
                                            not for the fact that Zhou Weiqing had held back, he would have already been
                                            drained til death. After all, the Devour Skill could not only drain Heavenly
                                            Energy, but also life force, and it all depended on what Zhou Weiqing wanted
                                            to focus on. As for the suction force that had pulled him in earlier, that
                                            was actually a form of the Devour Skill that he had used the Six Ultimate
                                            Skill Manipulation Arts to mimic and change.</p>
                                        <p>After two days of fighting, the more Zhou Weiqing used the Six Ultimate Skill
                                            Manipulation Arts, the more miraculous he found it was, always seeming to
                                            have an endless possibility in usage and myriad potential to delve deeper
                                            in. Who said that it would not be able to help him now… just the fine
                                            grained control in his various Attribute Heavenly Energy was similar to
                                            Shangguan Fei’er’s close combat skills, helping him in all forms of combat.
                                            Most noticeably, when he was using any Skills, he was able to save a lot of
                                            Heavenly Energy by reducing wastage. Zhou Weiqing had barely stepped into
                                            the doorway of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, learning everything
                                            on his own for the past six months without direct tutelage from Long Shiya,
                                            and he found that his anticipation of this Skill was growing by leaps and
                                            bounds.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu’s expression was ugly, but… she somehow did not flare out. Instead,
                                            her gaze was constant fixed upon Long Shiya, a flash of fear and doubt
                                            flickering in her eyes.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, the Sixteenth Regiment soldiers parted to form a path, and
                                            the Legion Commander of the Seventh Legion, Shen Ji, under the escort of
                                            over a dozen of his personal guards, rode in. He swiftly dismounted as soon
                                            as he reached the front.</p>
                                        <p>“What is going on? All of you calm down.” How could he not sense the strong
                                            smell of gunpowder in the air between both sides. Luckily, Shen Bu had some
                                            sense in her, and she had sent word to Shen Ji before bringing her men over.
                                            Seeing that her Senior Brother had arrived, only then did Shen Bu breathe a
                                            sigh of relief.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji’s expression was also not pretty. The reason why he had asked the
                                            Ruffian Battalion to return to the main northern army camp was mainly
                                            because of the background of Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er, and the fact
                                            they were from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace; to get in their good books. Who
                                            knew that just a single day after the Ruffian Battalion had returned,
                                            trouble had arisen… and from the looks of things, the trouble was not small
                                            at all.</p>
                                        <p>Facing Shen Ji’s piercing and forceful gaze, Zhou Weiqing did not back down.
                                            Although he felt regret now that his rash impulsion had caused the Peerless
                                            Battalion’s power to be revealed despite his efforts in hiding them, there
                                            was no use crying over spilt milk. As such, he might as well carry on in an
                                            aggressive and arrogant fashion, to teach the Sixteenth Regiment a lasting
                                            lesson.</p>
                                        <p>“What is going on? Legion Commander Shen Ji, you will have to ask your Junior
                                            Sister that question.” Zhou Weiqing said coldly.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji looked towards Shen Bu curiously, and she dared not hide anything,
                                            telling her everything that had happened.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing her words, Shen Ji’s expression grew even ugly, and he gave her an
                                            angry look. He couldn’t help but think inwardly: <i>I have already warned
                                                you not to provoke these ruffians, why must you still cause all that
                                                trouble? If this grows any further, even Master will not be able to save
                                                you!</i></p>
                                        <p>“Ridiculous! What do you both think this place is? This is the main camp of
                                            the northern command army, and both of you are officers in your own right,
                                            and yet you allow such a thing to happen?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said coldly: “Legion Commander Shen Ji, I have already given you
                                            a lot of face by not taking action right away. Now that you are here, that
                                            is good, you better uphold justice. Those Sixteenth Regiment soldiers
                                            purposely threw rubbish in our camp site, and all I did was to get my
                                            brothers to return it to them. This morning, they actually dared to come to
                                            our camp again to cause trouble.”</p>
                                        <p>“If I do not remember wrongly, according to army rules, without prior
                                            permission, no soldiers are allowed to enter other barracks or camps which
                                            do not belong to them. I ask that Legion Commander Shen Ji upholds military
                                            law and justice.”</p>
                                        <p>“Nonsense, it was clearly your men who attacked first!” One of the Battalion
                                            Commanders at Shen Bu’s side cried out angrily.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said disdainfully: “My men took action first? Very good… let me
                                            ask you… if someone came to your house, entered the door, and started
                                            scolding you, what would you do? This is our Peerless Battalion camp, our
                                            territory, and your men came here to look for trouble. Who knows if you are
                                            spies from the WanShou Empire, disguised here to look for information. Not
                                            killing you all is already very kind of us.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
