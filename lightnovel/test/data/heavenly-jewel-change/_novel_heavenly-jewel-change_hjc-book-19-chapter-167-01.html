                                            the Unicorn Cavalry soldiers they had faced previously, these two Beastmen
                                            were much easier to deal with.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, when they had been rescuing the surrounded Berserker and Gold
                                            Crow Tribes, the five hundred soldiers of the Peerless Battalion First Main
                                            Company had already awed and frightened off two of the WanShou Empire
                                            Regiments with their fighting prowess. Now, facing two Regiments which were
                                            arguably lesser than those other two, and with such a large number of allies
                                            beside them, the First Main Company started firing at will in confidence.
                                            Despite being archers, they did not pull back, instead advancing slowly to
                                            the front lines to the space which had been vacated, even as they continued
                                            firing rapidly. Within moments, the charging onslaught of enemies at the
                                            Sixteenth Regiment’s previous position was also almost emptied.</p>
                                        <p>As the Sixteenth Regiment retreated, the Heavy Infantry Regiment and the
                                            Peerless Battalion advanced slowly together in perfect unity. As Hua Feng
                                            issued order after order, the other Main Companies slowly joined in the fray
                                            as they got into position.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since the Peerless Battalion had grew to the strength of five thousand
                                            men, this was the first time they had all been together on the same
                                            battlefield. Five thousand Jewel Masters… elite archers with Consolidated
                                            Bows… what kind of notion was that!? Their shooting was actually really
                                            simple, with two Main Companies per group, in a cascading type formation,
                                            shooting continuously in proper sequence. Originally, these two WanShou
                                            Regiments, which the Six ZhongTian Regiments had been having so much trouble
                                            with, was instantly now being suppressed so simply. Along with the
                                            horrifying shrill sounds that struck terror in the hearts of all who heard
                                            them, waves of Wolf Cavalry Soldiers and Dog Tribe Infantry soldiers fell to
                                            the ground. In truth, it was not just the enemies, even the allied soldiers
                                            were so caught by surprise they did not understand what was going on, but at
                                            least the original pressure on them was greatly reduced.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, even the Peerless Battalion soldiers could not be perfect, and
                                            their arrows could definitely miss. Even so, they were far more accurate
                                            than any ordinary archers, and with those highly penetrative arrows fired
                                            from Consolidated Bows. In this, it could be easily seen by the number of
                                            severely wounded or killed after getting shot by the arrows.</p>
                                        <p>The flank, originally wheeling on the edge of danger and awaiting rescue…
                                            within the time for a few dozen breaths, the pressure was gone.</p>
                                        <p>After the Peerless Battalion entered the battlefield, the Wolf Cavalry
                                            Regiment and the Dog Tribe Scimitar Infantry Regiment soldiers could no
                                            longer take another step forward. Under the constant onslaught of arrow
                                            raining down upon them, all they could do was leave corpses on the wake.</p>
                                        <p>Some observant souls had managed to count on behalf of the Peerless
                                            Battalion… twenty four salvos of arrows, and the remnants of the Wolf
                                            Cavalry Regiment and Dog Tribe Scimitar Infantry Regiment retreated in bad
                                            shape… with barely a thousand men left in total.</p>
                                        <p>It was after all two entire powerful Regiments from the WanShou Empire! To
                                            any ZhongTian Empire soldier who saw that sight right there, it was like a
                                            dream… an illusion. Countless of them had thought they were about to die,
                                            and yet the fight suddenly ended before they knew it.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the Heavy Infantry soldiers by the side of the Peerless Battalion
                                            were totally shocked. They raised their tower shields, still in full
                                            disbelief. These fellows that trained with them everyday, they had actually
                                            created such a terrifying miracle. “PEERLESS IN THE WORLD!” A howl that rang
                                            through the skies, filled with excitement, rang out from every single one of
                                            the Peerless Battalion soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, they were the Peerless Battalion, Peerless in the World! In this
                                            battlefield in the north borders, in front of hundreds of thousands of
                                            ZhongTian Northwest Army soldiers, this was the first time that they had
                                            displayed their full strength to the world. They used their actions to prove
                                            to the world that though they might have been from the Ruffian Battalions of
                                            the world, they were the strongest… the Peerless Battalion was the absolute
                                            strongest!</p>
                                        <p>Even with the stable-ness of the seven God Tier Archers of the Heavenly Bow
                                            Unit, when they heard the earsplitting howls of the Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers, they couldn’t help but feel their blood boil with ardour as well.
                                            In their hearts a name rang out, the one who had created the Peerless
                                            Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, he had brought about a true miracle, and when this miracle descended
                                            upon their old homeland, who was to say that they would not be able to
                                            advance another miracle, to create a magnificent, mighty revival of their
                                            Empire!</p>
                                        <p>“Let’s move out, target the left flank. All of you listen to me properly,
                                            when we get to the left flank, I want you all to target the Unicorn Cavalry
                                            soldiers, but do your best not to harm any Unicorns Heavenly Beasts. Men,
                                            send someone to Tribe Leader Ma Long to prepare to receive those Heavenly
                                            Beasts with his tribesmen warriors.”</p>
                                        <p>The war was still continuing, but this was just the start of a miracle.</p>
                                        <p>Once again, they ignored the center lines. Once they achieved the decisive
                                            victory, the Peerless Battalion swiftly turned to the left flank, their
                                            targets the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment and the other Dog Tribe Scimitar
                                            Infantry Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>When the Peerless Battalion quietly left the right flank, only then did the
                                            commanding officers of both sides realise something was not right. In fact,
                                            both sides actually had the same feeling, that of abrupt shock. However, one
                                            side was a pleasant shock filled with happiness, while the other side was
                                            that of utter disbelief.</p>
                                        <p>“What’s going on? What happened on the right flank?” The overall commanding
                                            officer of the Northwest Armies, one of the three great supreme commanders,
                                            Admiral Brando of the ZhongTian Empire exclaimed to his subordinate, his
                                            eyes filled with shock. He just received news that the two enemy Regiments
                                            on the right flank had fled with less than a tenth of them alive.</p>
                                        <p>They had warred with the WanShou Empire for so many years, and this was truly
                                            the first time Admiral Brando had met with such a circumstance. A moment
                                            ago, he had just been about to dispatch men to reinforce the right flank
                                            which had been in severe danger, and the next moment, a fresh report had
                                            come.</p>
                                        <p>“It’s the Peerless Battalion, they truly produced a miracle!” The one who
                                            spoke was an old man of about sixty or older, standing beside Admiral Brando
                                            in full uniform. He was Shen Ji, Shen Bu and Shen Yi’s godfather and Master,
                                            the Vice Commander of the ZhongTian Northwest Army, General Shen Wu.</p>
                                        <p>“Wait… do you mean to say… that strange Battalion that the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace used all the Ruffian Battalions to form?” Naturally, Admiral Brando
                                            knew of the Peerless Battalion, just that prior to this he had never paid
                                            much attention to it. It was not to say that he attach much importance to
                                            them, but he was unable to do so. After all, the matter of having the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace intervene in such matters was extremely sensitive,
                                            and if they actually intervened in the war, it might not be a good thing in
                                            the big picture. As such, he had always pretended not to notice anything
                                            about the matter, allowing Shen Wu to handle everything.</p>
                                        <p>“The Peerless Battalion actually has such powerful destructive powers? How
                                            did they do that?” Admiral Brando exclaimed in surprise towards Shen Wu.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Wu gave a bitter smile and said: “Admiral, I’m not sure myself. I’ve
                                            sent people to check for myself, and I think I should get some news back
                                            soon.”</p>
                                        <p>It didn’t take long before the Seventh Legion Commander Shen Ji personally
                                            got to the headquarters.</p>
                                        <p>“Greetings Commander in Chief, Vice Commander.” Shen Ji’s face was filled
                                            with both shock and excitement. Having heard about precise news earlier, it
                                            was hard for him to believe it as well. However, the facts were right in
                                            front of his eyes, and he had no choice but to accept it. He knew that
                                            things were crucial, and immediately went personally to report to the
                                            headquarters. After all, only he was sufficiently knowledgeable and familiar
                                            with the Peerless Battalion, and once they had taken down the two Regiments
                                            on the right flank, it would become the Northwest Army Command’s top level
                                            secret.</p>
                                        <p>“Shen Ji, what is going on?” Admiral Branco asked solemnly.</p>
                                        <p>“Consolidated Bows! Commander, Consolidated Bows! Those Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers are ALL Jewel Masters… five thousand Jewel Masters! Oh my god, it
                                            is five thousand Jewel Masters!! They are mostly Physical Jewel Masters, and
                                            with their powerful Consolidated Bows, within over twenty salvos of firing
                                            they took down the foes from the two Regiments.”</p>
                                        <p>“Wait. What? All Jewel Masters? How is that possible? Weren’t those soldiers
                                            all from the original Ruffian Battalions?” Shen Wu couldn’t help but
                                            exclaim.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji gave a bitter smile and said: “I do not know the exact state of
                                            affairs. After all, our estimation of the Peerless Battalion was already
                                            extremely high, but I never expected that it was still a severe
                                            underestimation of them. They have now gone to the left flank. Because they
                                            had the background of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, I did not direct them…
                                            Commander, Vice Commander, what should we do now?”</p>
                                        <p>Admiral Branco stood up abruptly and he said: “What do we do? What else do
                                            you need me to say? Send my orders, Shen Ji, I want you to personally lead
                                            my Personal Guard Regiment to support the Peerless Battalion. No matter
                                            what, do not let any harm come to them. Hurry, go immediately. The presence
                                            of the Peerless Battalion might be the exact thing that can save our entire
                                            Northwest Army, to turn the tides of this supposedly impossible
                                            situation.”</p>
                                        <p>As the commanding officer and an experienced Admiral, it was without question
                                            that Brando could instantly sense that the presence of the Peerless
                                            Battalion was a perfect chance for them. Next, he gave another order for his
                                            two reserve Heavy Cavalry Regiments to move out into the battlefield. They
                                            only had one order, to work together in ensuring the safety of the Peerless
                                            Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Although Admiral Brando wasn’t exactly certain about the exact offensive
                                            capabilities and strength of the Peerless Battalion, he was certain that if
                                            they truly could take down two WanShou Empire Regiments in such a short
                                            amount of time, then the Peerless Battalion would be a god tier weapon for
                                            the side of the Northwest Army… one that would help them against the WanShou
                                            Empire armies.</p>
                                        <p>While Admiral Brando made the series of arrangements, the situation on the
                                            battlefield was also going through its own series of rapid changes.</p>
                                        <p>The ten Regiments of the WanShou Empire holding back was also starting to
                                            show some movement. Far off in the distance, a massive black cloud rose up,
                                            swarming like a strange dark cloud and flying towards the battlefield,
                                            quickly reaching almost a thousand metres high</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that patch of dark clouds, the Northwest Army who were by now
                                            extremely familiar with the WanShou Empire armies, were totally caught by
                                            surprise. Of course, they totally recognized and knew what the dark clouds
                                            meant… just surprised by their presence here. They were after all one of the
                                            aces of the WanShou Empire armies, the Eagle Tribesmen Air Force.</p>
                                        <p>In the entire WanShou Empire, only the Eagle Tribesmen were able to tame and
                                            rear mounts with flying capabilities, at least at enough numbers to form a
                                            troop. The whole WanShou Empire only mustered a single Regiment of their
                                            numbers. Of course, due to their rarity, they were not gathered together in
                                            a Regiment, instead gathered in Battalions, distributed to the various
                                            armies in the WanShou Empire. However, they would not easily join the battle
                                            unless absolutely necessary.</p>
                                        <p>No one could have imagined that the WanShou Empire would have paid so much
                                            attention to the Northwest Armies that they would actually send the Eagle
                                            Tribesmen… seeing them rise up into the airs, it looked to be about two
                                            whole Battalions of them!</p>
                                        <p>If one were to say that the Tyrannical Bear Regiment was still able to be
                                            blocked in a headon clash, no matter how tough that was, then the Eagle
                                            Tribesmen was an ever victorious force that had never been defeated in
                                            battle. The reason was simple - besides the WanShou Empire, there were no
                                            other countries in the entire Mainland that had a proper air force.</p>
                                        <p>The War Eagle Mounts that the Eagle Tribesmen warriors reared were about two
                                            metres in length, but their wingspans were more than five metres long, able
                                            to easily carry a Eagle Tribesman Warrior, who were one of the smaller
                                            amongst the Beastmen. The War Eagles all carried twelve short javelins and
                                            quivers of arrows… from a certain perspective, their equipment was very
                                            similar to the Peerless Battalion, except that the Eagle Tribesmen Warriors
                                            were mounted upon their War Eagle Mounts, while the Peerless Battalion would
                                            have to fly on their own.</p>
