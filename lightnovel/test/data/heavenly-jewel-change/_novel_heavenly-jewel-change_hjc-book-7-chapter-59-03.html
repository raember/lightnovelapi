                                            true density and weight of this 4-Jeweled Assembly Equipment Tower Shield…
                                            almost six thousand jin! Any ordinary three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master,
                                            even one with the Strength Attribute, would not be able to move it. Yet,
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s shove caused him to feel an obvious pressure, like a
                                            ferocious wave in the turbulent seas.</p>
                                        <p>“Good, very good, little bro, your strength is impressive.” Lin TianAo smiled
                                            faintly, dipping his wrist down a little. Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel
                                            the shield in front of him stabilize, becoming just like Lin TianAo, steady
                                            and immovable as a mountain. Instantly, he withdrew his strength, and the
                                            strength from the shield immediately vanished.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo stood there looking at him with a passive smile on his face, as if
                                            supremely confident that he understood everything that Zhou Weiqing could
                                            throw at him.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, a cold, savage light flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, and his
                                            right leg lashed out like a whip.</p>
                                        <p>*Claaang* A huge roar rang out, the sudden earsplitting sound giving Yun Li
                                            and the red robed man a scare. Both of them had not expected that sudden
                                            kick to actually strike upon the shield with such an impact, like that of a
                                            huge hammer, and to give off such a terrifying sound.</p>
                                        <p>The one who was most stunned was naturally Lin TianAo himself. Previously,
                                            facing Yun Li’s full out attack, he had not even been shaken a little, yet
                                            this time with just a seemingly simple kick, he had actually swayed a
                                            little, as the Tower Shield shoved into the ground actually
                                            reverberated.</p>
                                        <p>The ground seemed to groan beneath that. The floor of the arena rooms were
                                            actually made out of titanium alloy, but under the impact and weight of Lin
                                            TianAo’s heavy shield, a one chi long opening was torn open. From that, one
                                            could just imagine how powerful Zhou Weiqing’s kick was.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, once again, Zhou Weiqing had unleashed the full explosive effect of
                                            his Demonic Right Leg, its short term instantaneous attack power reaching
                                            his Dual Hammers! This sudden strike of Zhou Weiqing’s was his true hidden
                                            attack, as he had actually infused that kick with an immense amount of
                                            Heavenly Energy. Added to the surprise factor, even Lin TianAo’s insane
                                            shield and defense had been almost thrown back by that direct hit.</p>
                                        <p>A few years back, when Zhou Weiqing had swallowed the black pearl, it could
                                            be said to be a Heavenly Core of an unbelievably powerful Heavenly Beast.
                                            However, that Heavenly Beast did not belong to this universe, coming from a
                                            totally different universe. It had been attacked by a powerful foe which it
                                            couldn’t beat, and at the last moment it had torn open a spatial rift and
                                            escaped with its Heavenly Core, but alas that had ended up being swallowed
                                            by Zhou Weiqing and benefitting him instead. [1. This is from Douluo Dalu,
                                            not sure if the fight has been translated yet, so will not spoil any further
                                            :)] This powerful Heavenly Beast’s body was known for its strength, and its
                                            strength was extremely powerful, and amongst that the strongest was its
                                            tail. Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic Right Leg had indeed inherited the power of
                                            that very tail.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s entire body was filled with strength, but a large bulk of it
                                            could only be accessed while in the Demonic Change state. The only exception
                                            to that was his Demonic Right Leg, and as Zhou Weiqing had grown, its attack
                                            had grown more and more terrifying.</p>
                                        <p>The intense backlash caused Zhou Weiqing’s body to spin around the ground,
                                            but his right leg did not feel any pain, and it lashed out again
                                            immediately.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that Lin TianAo was the first person to suffer the full
                                            force of his Demonic Right Leg without taking any damage. Having such a good
                                            punching bag, how could Zhou Weiqing not want to try out the full strength
                                            of his right leg?</p>
                                        <p>By now, Yun Li was staring at the scene before him dumbfounded. Although his
                                            own abilities did not lie in strength, he could hardly believe that Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s simple kick could do what he could not, despite having put all his
                                            full might behind his attack. Was that rascal even human?</p>
                                        <p>On the other hand, Lin TianAo was even more shocked than Yun Li. On one hand,
                                            he had severely underestimated Zhou Weiqing and not used his full might in
                                            holding the shield. However, he had also been lucky that the floor was made
                                            of a titanium alloy. If not for that, perhaps he would have been shoved back
                                            along with his shield, and lost the bet there and then.</p>
                                        <p>Masking the surprise in his heart, he focused on the fight before him once
                                            more, as a brilliant thick yellow light shot forth once more around his
                                            right hands, and his fifth Yellow Jade Physical Jewel actually melded into
                                            the shield again. As it became a five-Jeweled Assembly Equipment, its
                                            greater weight caused it to sink down, digging deeper into the ground. At
                                            the same time, all five of his Elemental Jewels embedded themselves into the
                                            sockets on the shield.</p>
                                        <p>Such a sudden blow had caused Lin TianAo to reel in his easygoing manner, and
                                            he would not make any more mistakes. After all, this bet was his lifetime
                                            freedom! By now, the incense stick had been burned a fifth. He was resolute
                                            that he would use all his might to defend himself from the two; he could not
                                            afford to lose as well!</p>
                                        <p>Another huge clashing sound rang as Zhou Weiqing’s second kick slammed into
                                            the shield. Alas, this time, he was thrown back just like Yun Li, though he
                                            recovered much better, spinning around in midair to land back on his feet
                                            stably.</p>
                                        <p>“Damn.” Looking at the new shield in Lin TianAo’s hand, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t
                                            help but let lose a curse in his mind. That was just too disgusting. Turning
                                            his head, he looked at Yun Li, only to see that Yun Li’s expression was
                                            extremely ugly.</p>
                                        <p>A five-Jeweled Assembly Equipment like that was definitely made by at least a
                                            Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Master. Furthermore, even a Zong Stage
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master would have to spend at least five years of
                                            full concentration and lots of precious materials in order to create such a
                                            set.</p>
                                        <p>This ultra heavy shield in Lin TianAo’s hand was about 2 metres wide and 2.2
                                            metres tall, glowing in a brilliant yellow. It was marked with strange
                                            markings like that of a turtle’s back,  while there were five sockets
                                            currently filled with his Elemental Jewels spaced out neatly around the
                                            shield. Without question, all of his skills were also defensive ones
                                            designed to be used in conjunction with this shield. Such a defense was
                                            unbelievably disgusting, and Zhou Weiqing was not even sure if a High Level
                                            Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master like Ming Wu could even destroy it.</p>
                                        <p>It wasn’t just the shield alone. Even Lin TianAo was also glowing with a
                                            similar light as the shield, as if he was one with his shield. Beyond a
                                            doubt, this was Lin TianAo’s strongest state, and even Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            Demonic Right Leg’s full power bounced off it.</p>
                                        <p>By now, Yun Li had already recovered a little, and he walked towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing. With a bitter smile, he said: “What now? Don’t tell me that I’m
                                            going to lose myself in a bet for the second time today?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “There is still a lot of time, do not
                                            worry so soon.” At the same time, his brain was running through all possible
                                            solutions. The reason why he was so calm was not just because of his
                                            character, but also because of Tian Er’s promise to him. However, facing
                                            such a powerful defense, both he and Yun Li were getting a headache trying
                                            to break through it.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo was naturally happy to wait while they weren’t attacking, and he
                                            stood there silently preparing himself. The time for an incense stick to
                                            burn wasn’t exactly a long time, but it wasn’t short either.</p>
                                        <p>“His shield can only defend a single side, let’s launch a pincer attack from
                                            the front and back.” Zhou Weiqing finally said solemnly.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li’s eyes brightened and he nodded in agreement. Just as he was about to
                                            turn around to take action, he heard Zhou Weiqing’s voice speak silently in
                                            his ear: “You can start the attack first, with harassment as your priority,
                                            do not expend too much Heavenly Energy. When I give the signal with a loud
                                            shout, then we will both take action at the same time. At that point, I need
                                            you to launch your full powered attack once more, just like the previous
                                            time. Your target will be his left leg.”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li nodded slightly to indicate his understanding and with a quick flash,
                                            he had routed around to behind Lin TianAo, who smiled faintly and said: “You
                                            should have done this at the start. Let’s go then!”</p>
                                        <p>His composure and confidence did not affect Zhou Weiqing at all. Lifting his
                                            left hand, the Overlord Bow coalesced into his hands in an icy mist.</p>
                                        <p>In order to ensure this win, Zhou Weiqing knew he needed to unleash every
                                            weapon in his arsenal, and naturally all his strongest skills lay in his
                                            archery. In truth, Zhou Weiqing’s melee combat was lacking a lot as compared
                                            to his archery skills, and only the fact that he had a lot more skills than
                                            an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master, and many of them of high ratings, that he
                                            was usually able to get the jump in close combat situations. After all, his
                                            two years spent in the Heavenly Bow Unit were spent learning and training
                                            with their members, whose abilities were all long range. Naturally, the two
                                            years of trainings there had molded him into a powerful archer as well.</p>
                                        <p>Overlord Bow in hand, Zhou Weiqing entered a strange state, and even Lin
                                            TianAo at the other end could sense the sudden change in his aura.</p>
                                        <p>Just like how Lin TianAo seemed to be one with his shield, the current Zhou
                                            Weiqing also gave the impression of being one with his bow. That huge
                                            Overlord Bow seemed to be part of his hands, like the eyes of his arms,
                                            while his own eyes turned sharp and piercing.</p>
                                        <p>*Weng* A sound rang out, and it seemed as if the bowstring vibrated a little
                                            and in the next instant a huge explosion rang out against Lin TianAo’s
                                            shield, almost at the same time as the screeching sound.</p>
                                        <p><i>So fast! </i>Once again, Lin TianAo was given a shock in his heart.
                                            Although the explosive effect of the Overlord Bow was still far from being
                                            able to shake his shield, he still had not managed to get a clear look at
                                            Zhou Weiqing drawing his bow and releasing it. <i>This fellow is actually an
                                                archer? </i>Without knowing why, a bad feeling suddenly struck Lin
                                            TianAo, and he realised that he had once again underestimated this
                                            three-Jeweled youth.</p>
                                        <p>This underground arena room was only thirty yards wide in diameter, and while
                                            that was very large for a close combat fight, it was an extremely short
                                            distance for an archer, especially for a bow with such a range and power
                                            like the Overlord Bow. However, if it were an ordinary fight, such a short
                                            distance would be a detriment to an archer, as a quick charge would mean the
                                            opponent reaching him easily. However, they were in the midst of a bet, and
                                            Lin TianAo was not allowed to move, and could only allow Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Yun Li to attack as he pleased, while he stood in the middle of the room.
                                            Even though Zhou Weiqing was standing at the edge of the room, barely a
                                            dozen yards from him, he was not able to do anything about it. Under such a
                                            range, even a Higher Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master would not be
                                            able to easily dodge such an arrow, especially one shot from the Overlord
                                            Bow. The range of about a dozen yards would also allow the arrow to fly
                                            enough to reach a good acceleration, at least reaching eighty percent of its
                                            full power. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing’s Overlord Bow had two sockets. After
                                            all, no matter how good a shield was, it was not worn armor, and it would
                                            not be able to block every inch of his body. After felt Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            powerful kick earlier, Lin TianAo did not dare underestimate him again.</p>
                                        <p>However, no one in the room noticed a dim black light stealthily creeping out
                                            from below Zhou Weiqing’s feet. It was the Touch of Darkness, but it was
                                            currently not being used for its binding powers, but to improve his
                                            senses.</p>
                                        <p></p>
