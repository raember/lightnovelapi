                                        <p><i>Oh no! Not good! </i>Cold sweat streamed down Zhou Weiqing’s back as fear
                                            and shock overwhelmed him. Subconsciously, he circulated his own Heavenly
                                            Energy, surrounding the fresh new drop of silvery white liquid, forcing it
                                            into his mouth. At the same time, he pulled Tian’er into his embrace,
                                            lowering his head and giving her a kiss on her pale red lips.</p>
                                        <p>Just like that, the drop of liquid passed through their lips into Tian’er’s
                                            mouth, and a strange spectacle occurred next. Standing at the side,
                                            Shangguan Xue’er could only stare with her jaw agape as she watched the two
                                            kiss, and from their mouths, an utterly pure form of energy seemed to
                                            diffuse all around, instantly engulfing Tian’er within. She could clearly
                                            see a faint light shine forth, starting from Tian’er’s head, slowly moving
                                            down. Within moments, her entire body was glowing, and a large Heavenly
                                            Energy reverberation began. All the Heavenly Energy and life force that
                                            Tian’er had lost seemed to return, and her eyes began to open… filled with
                                            surprise and shock.</p>
                                        <p>The whirlpool in Zhou Weiqing’s body continued spinning, continuing to draw
                                            upon his and Tian’er’s original Heavenly Energy… and as it spun… more drops
                                            of the white liquid continued to be generated.</p>
                                        <p>Slowly, Zhou Weiqing began to get the hang of it. He would leave one drop of
                                            the white liquid for himself, one drop to Tian’er, and so on… In this way,
                                            an intriguing but marvelous loop began.</p>
                                        <p>At the side, Shangguan Xue’er had a totally different sensation. All the
                                            energy aside, in her eyes, all she saw was Zhou Weiqing holding onto
                                            Tian’er, their bodies pressed against each other. Every once in awhile, Zhou
                                            Weiqing would lean forward to kiss Tian’er deeply.</p>
                                        <p>The strangest thing was that everytime they kissed, a brilliant light would
                                            appear around Tian’er, as if the precious light of treasure. Originally,
                                            Tian’er was already a great beauty, and each time that happened, it was as
                                            if she was evolving, her beauty shining forth even more, even her skin
                                            purifying. Looking at that, Shangguan Xue’er was not only shocked, but also
                                            slightly envious.</p>
                                        <p>How are they doing that? Wasn’t it the Devour Skill? How did it end up like
                                            this?</p>
                                        <p>As the process continued, the amount of the silvery white liquid in Zhou
                                            Weiqing and Tian’er’s bodies grew steadily, and their original Heavenly
                                            Energy also continued dropping.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had cultivated together with the four Saint
                                            Attributes fusion so many times before, but this was the first time
                                            something like this had occurred.</p>
                                        <p>In the past, when the cultivated together, they would release their Heavenly
                                            Energy, allowing the four Saint Attributes to gather between or above them.
                                            In that way, the Saint Attributes would begin to spin and form the
                                            whirlpool, drawing in energy. As their Heavenly Energy slowly increased, it
                                            would be drawn back into their bodies and made their own.</p>
                                        <p>Such a cultivation technique, it was already far faster than if they were to
                                            cultivate individually and separately. However, this strange silvery white
                                            liquid had never appeared before!</p>
                                        <p>In this moment, a vague understanding slowly came to Zhou Weiqing. The
                                            profound secret should be the difference between the fusion occuring outside
                                            the body and within the body.</p>
                                        <p>Perhaps, the current situation happening in his body was the truest form of
                                            the cultivation with the four Saint Attributes. Furthermore, he guessed that
                                            the true key to this miraculous event was not the Devour Skill, but the life
                                            force of both of them fused together.</p>
                                        <p>The Devour Skill had only been the tool to bring all of their energies
                                            together into Zhou Weiqing’s body to form such a new whirlpool. When their
                                            life forces had joined together due to the Devour Skill, they had also fused
                                            together to join into the four Saint Attributes fusion. Under such a
                                            circumstance, the fusion of the four Saint Attributes had been ignited,
                                            causing such a miraculous chain reaction.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, Zhou Weiqing’s guess was pretty accurate, but still incomplete. As he
                                            had imagined, when the four Saint Attributes gathered together, life force
                                            was the key to activating and igniting the change. However, at the same
                                            time, it was also due to the fact that when the four Saint Attributes fused
                                            outside of their bodies, it would draw in all forms of energy from the
                                            atmosphere. At that time, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had thought it was
                                            naturally a good thing to draw in the atmospheric energy… after all, it
                                            could only be a boost right?</p>
                                        <p>However, the truth was actually the reverse.</p>
                                        <p>The four Saint Attributes were the highest quality Attributes in the world,
                                            and within them was a vast potential and miraculous force. When they fused
                                            together, how could they require the addition of other weaker and mixed
                                            energies? All they needed was absolute purity, not additional quantity of
                                            other unnecessary energies. When they were fully purified, the four Saint
                                            Attributes would grow in synergy, interpromoting reciprocally and having
                                            mutual generation, resulting in a all around growth and evolving.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, the four Saint Attribute fusion was right in Zhou Weiqing’s body,
                                            and it was a strangely favourable condition endowed by nature… with the
                                            Dragon Tiger Transformation, his body had a natural pure XianTian or
                                            primordial force. This was something that the four Saint Attributes needed.
                                            Furthermore, within his body, as they gathered an spun, they would not come
                                            into contact or draw in the various mixed atmospheric energies that were
                                            full of other impurities. Under such a circumstance, with the mix of Zhou
                                            Weiqing and Tian’er’s life forces, only then had the true profound secret of
                                            the four Saint Attributes been revealed.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s luck was truly good. If not
                                            for all of these unique circumstances coming into play, perhaps in their
                                            entire lives they would never discover this profound secret.</p>
                                        <p>By going through this process, not only was their entire Heavenly Energy
                                            going through a fresh round of purification and refining, it was also going
                                            through the evolving of the four Saint Attributes fusion. In this manner,
                                            their original Heavenly Energy without going through their Elemental Jewels,
                                            had not transformed into the purest energy in the world, with the aura of
                                            the four Saint Attribute fusion energy. This was truly the purest form of
                                            energy in the world that any Heavenly Jewel Master could have.</p>
                                        <p>A human’s DanTian had its limits, and before reaching the Heavenly King
                                            stage, this limit would not be broken. As for the Heavenly King Stage? This
                                            was actually one of the greatest bottlenecks of this stage. Only when one
                                            was able to break past this major limiting factor, transforming their energy
                                            to a whole different level, only then would a Heavenly Jewel Master be able
                                            to reach the next stage. However, the size of the DanTian and the Ki Ocean
                                            would not change. That was to say, even for a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse,
                                            besides having his meridians and internal organs stronger and more flexible,
                                            his ‘load bearing’ and capacity was actually no different from an ordinary
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>Although their meridians were widened, there was definitely a limit, and it
                                            was impossible for it to continually widen forever. If that really happened,
                                            wouldn’t the person just explode?</p>
                                        <p>Now, this silvery white liquid that Zhou Weiqing had formed from this round
                                            of cultivation was totally different. The inherent energy held within was
                                            more than ten times that of the Heavenly Energy liquid of the same level.
                                            That was to say, Zhou Weiqing could store more than ten times the energy in
                                            his body. Furthermore, that was a qualitative change, not that he had
                                            compressed the energy. This would mean both he and Tian’er, when compared to
                                            a Heavenly Jewel Master of the same level, their energy purity and density
                                            was far stronger than anyone, and their sustainability would be on a whole
                                            new level. Furthermore, once they could enter the Heavenly King Stage, that
                                            would be yet another concept altogether. The true profound secret of the
                                            four Saint Attribute would only come into play fully then, and the future
                                            benefits it would bring them was not something they could even dream about
                                            now, far beyond the limits of their mortal comprehension.</p>
                                        <p>Time passed, seconds and minutes. Nearly an entire day and night passed
                                            before all their Heavenly Energy had been fully refined and transformed.</p>
                                        <p>Although Shangguan Xue’er was rather envious and even jealous, she still kept
                                            guard by their side. She knew that such unique opportunities were few and
                                            far between for any Heavenly Jewel Master, and once they missed it, it would
                                            be a regret that they would have to live with forever. Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Tian’er’s cultivation level did not seem to have much changes, but the aura
                                            and presence they gave off, it was as if they had been born anew.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, the last bits of their Heavenly Energy entered the whirlpool, and
                                            the last drop of silvery white liquid formed.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er both had the feeling like their DanTian
                                            and meridians were so empty. The originally feeling of being filled with
                                            energy had disappeared, and all they had within each of them was a mere over
                                            twenty drops of that silvery white liquid. Even then, they could sense that
                                            their total amount of Heavenly Energy was actually more than previously.
                                            Although it was all contained within that twenty plus drops of liquid, it
                                            was without a doubt their inherent energy was terrifying. The strangest
                                            thing was that it was not a condensed or compressed form as well, and they
                                            did not need to focus on controlling it.</p>
                                        <p>The whirlpool slowly dissipated silently. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing also
                                            discovered something else strange. That was… despite the sheer power of his
                                            Devour Skill, it was unable to draw anything from Tian’er’s body any longer.
                                            That was to say, the silvery white liquid Heavenly Energy was totally immune
                                            from his Devour Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Towards this point, Zhou Weiqing was rather pleasantly surprised. It was
                                            without question that the silvery white Heavenly Energy was on a whole
                                            different level, not something that any existing cultivation technique could
                                            cultivate or refine. After this strange cultivation process, a whole new
                                            door had been opened to both him and Tian’er, and they were slowly starting
                                            to realise the true potential of the four Saint Attributes.</p>
                                        <p>The Devour Skill also stopped at last, as the whirlpool within Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            body finally stopped. The cultivation of the two of them had also finally
                                            stopped after an entire day and night. Tian’er had also been kissed so many
                                            times by Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, during the cultivation, as the time passed and it reached the later
                                            stages, the time between the production of each drop of the silvery white
                                            liquid began to take longer and longer time. In Zhou Weiqing’s senses, it
                                            was due to the fact that their ‘raw materials’ were running out, thus the
                                            cultivation speed had also slowed dramatically. However, despite that,
                                            before the entire process was complete, how could Zhou Weiqing bear to stop?
                                            Who knew if there would be a future chance like this, and if he passed it
                                            up, they might regret it in the future.</p>
                                        <p>“Xue’er, come here a while.” After ending this round of cultivation, that was
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s first words.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing with brimming with energy and almost radiant in
                                            complexion, Shangguan Xue’er who was extremely tired started momentarily,
                                            but she still walked towards him.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Shangguan Xue’er reached Zhou Weiqing, in that instant, Zhou Weiqing
                                            suddenly grabbed hold of her waist without warning, lowering his head to
                                            give her a kiss.</p>
                                        <p>“Wuuuu…” Facing such a sudden intimate violation, Shangguan Xue’er was caught
                                            off guard, embarrassed fully. If it had just been her and Zhou Weiqing,
                                            perhaps she would not have resisted, or not struggled so much. However,
                                            Tian’er was right there! With her character, how could she not be
                                            embarrassed?</p>
                                        <p>However, before she could struggle too violently, she suddenly realised that
                                            a shameless scoundrel had actually stuck his tongue into her mouth.</p>
                                        <p>Filled with sudden anger, Shangguan Xue’er bit down onto Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            tongue.</p>
                                        <p>In shock and pain, Zhou Weiqing quickly withdrew his tongue. “Aiiiiyaaa, that
                                            hurts! Xue’er, what are you doing!”</p>
                                        <p>The tongue was perhaps one of the weakest spots in the entire human body, and
                                            having it bitten, how could it feel good? Furthermore, Shangguan Xue’er had
                                            been in a state of anger and embarrassment, and that bite had been stronger
                                            than she realised.</p>
