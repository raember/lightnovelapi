                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not know how he could possibly destroy that protective gold
                                            shield around Gu YingBing, but he definitely had to give it a try.</p>
                                        <p>The Yin Yang Giant Palm struck down on the golden shield of the Divine
                                            Guardian Angel, and Zhou Weiqing felt a fiery hot power stream into him, as
                                            if his entire soul was being burnt. Even though he was wearing the Yin Yang
                                            Giant Spirit Palm, the strange feeling of heat caused even him to cry out in
                                            pain, his entire body leaping back instantly.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing gave a cold laugh and said: “You have the Demonic and Darkness
                                            Attributes, and you actually dared touch my Divine Guardian Angel? Don’t you
                                            know that the Divine Attribute is the antithesis to all Darkness Type
                                            powers…”</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing’s heart felt as if he had finally seen the
                                            light. He finally understood why he seemed to suppressed on all levels by Gu
                                            YingBing. It was not just the sheer difference in power between them, but
                                            also the addition of the attributes clashing. His opponent had the Divine
                                            Attribute, one of the Four Saint Attributes, which just happened to counter
                                            both his Demonic and Darkness Attributes, and thus causing some of his
                                            strongest Skills to be rendered useless. That was the reason why the Dark
                                            Demon God Lightning had been so easily destroyed by the Divine Attribute, as
                                            it consisted of both the Demonic and Darkness Attributes!</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing took a large step towards Zhou Weiqing. Naturally, he could tell
                                            that currently Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy was almost totally expended.
                                            Although he had not expected that taking down Zhou Weiqing would take him so
                                            long and so much trouble, but it was undoubtedly his victory.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath, his eyes focused totally. At the same time,
                                            the over twenty energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points were at
                                            their absolute maximum, spinning crazily as they drew Heavenly Energy from
                                            the atmosphere to help him recover.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing’s right hand waved, and the Dragon Head Staff in his hands
                                            actually flew towards Zhou Weiqing, glowing brilliantly with gold light. In
                                            that moment, the gold light glowed hard and the Dragon Head Staff seemed to
                                            come to live, warping into a large two zhang[1. a unit of measurement (3.3m
                                            long)] long golden wolf pouncing directly at Zhou Weiqing. This was the
                                            imbued Skill from this God Tier Consolidated Equipment of his.</p>
                                        <p>A layer of almost crystalline grey light lit up from Zhou Weiqing’s body, and
                                            in a loud *PENG* sound, it actually managed to block the charge of the
                                            massive gold dragon. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing lifted up his head,
                                            looking directly at the Lion Prince Gu YingBing, and two bouts of purple red
                                            light flashed from his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Even if there was just a slightest chance, Zhou Weiqing was not willing to
                                            give up. What he was using now was the spiritual attack portion of the
                                            Demonic Dragon God Seal.</p>
                                        <p>Almost at the same time, two gold lights flashed in Gu YingBing’s eyes, and
                                            the two different glows actually clashed in mid air, causing violent sparks.
                                            Zhou Weiqing felt his eyes hurt in a sudden stabbing pain, and his entire
                                            body stumbled back uncontrollably as his entire brain felt as if it was
                                            being smashed repeatedly with a mallet.</p>
                                        <p>“Hmph, to actually use a spiritual attack against me… one who has the Spirit
                                            Attribute… what a conceited joke. Your cultivation level and Skill are just
                                            too far away from me…”</p>
                                        <p>The Lion Prince said disdainfully, as he walked closer and closer, and Zhou
                                            Weiqing had no choice but to use Ward of the Demon God to barely resist the
                                            gold dragon’s attack, his body being shoved back uncontrollably. Although
                                            his Heavenly Energy recovery rate was extremely fast, under the incessant
                                            onslaught of the massive gold dragon, the expenditure of Heavenly Energy of
                                            the Ward of the Demon God was far beyond his own recovery rate.</p>
                                        <p>“Enough! Gu YingBing, you dare…” Shangguan Fei’er could no longer hold back,
                                            and in a flash she charged forward.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, the two old men who had came together with Gu YingBing
                                            appeared in a flash in the path of Shangguan Fei’er and Lin TianAo.</p>
                                        <p>“Heavenly King…” Shangguan Fei’er couldn’t help but cry in shock.</p>
                                        <p>What status did Gu YingBing have? In the entire WanShou Empire, he was
                                            definitely at the top of the pyramid. The Lionman Tribe had been the Royal
                                            Family of the WanShou Empire for so many years, and they had unbelievable
                                            resources. Naturally, these two Heavenly King stage powerhouses were
                                            specially here to protect him as his bodyguards.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo and Shangguan Fei’er might be extremely powerful, their Heavenly
                                            Energy cultivation level or combat abilities not to be underestimated,
                                            especially for their ages. However, with each of them facing a Heavenly King
                                            Stage powerhouse, what could they do? They were not able to get past them so
                                            easily. Of course, the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses would not take
                                            action against them without Gu YingBing’s orders, just blocking their way.
                                            Otherwise, perhaps all three of them would die right then.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing did not seem to hear Shangguan Fei’er’s words, slowly stepping
                                            towards Zhou Weiqing with a ferocious look in his eyes. Looking at this love
                                            rival, his heart was filled with a strong killing intent. Today, he had won,
                                            but he was also clear that this live rival was more than a dozen years
                                            younger than he was. More importantly, he had already won Tian’er’s
                                            heart.</p>
                                        <p>At last, Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy fully ran out. Facing a true
                                            powerhouse, the weakness he had in having a fighting style totally about an
                                            explosive burst of offense. He did not have sufficient Heavenly Energy to
                                            sustain all the various Skills he used to block against the Lion Prince’s
                                            powerful attacks. Furthermore, many of his Skills were fully suppressed by
                                            Gu YingBing.</p>
                                        <p>The Ward of the Demon God also dissipated into sparks of light, and the giant
                                            gold dragon smashed savagely into Zhou Weiqing’s chest.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s entire body was sent flying up in the air, fresh blood
                                            spurting from his mouth. If not for the protection of the Source of
                                            Strength, he would have been instantly killed by that blow.</p>
                                        <p>The Gold Dragon swooped back to the Lion Prince’s hands, turning back into
                                            the Dragon Head Staff. He took a last step forward to reach Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>That blow was just too savage. Zhou Weiqing did not even have a single bit of
                                            Heavenly Energy left, the Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms and Source of Strength
                                            vanished, with nothing left to sustain them. At the same time, the Demonic
                                            Change State faded back into his body. Zhou Weiqing fell down, his face pale
                                            and ashen, his innards feeling like they were being turned upside down and
                                            thrown about, causing him to vomit out a mouthful of blood involuntarily. At
                                            this point, he found it difficult to even breathe.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing did not continue attacking, not giving him that one final
                                            finishing blow. He just stood there, looking down upon the fallen Zhou
                                            Weiqing, tall stout and handsome as his eyes flashed in a ferocious light, a
                                            hesitant, pondering look on his face.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the Lion Prince’s eyes, Zhou Weiqing felt his a film of red cover
                                            his eyes. Despite the utter pain his entire body was in, he still forced
                                            himself, pushing himself bit by bit to clamber to his feet. Even if he was
                                            about to die, he would not die in such a position, but would stand tall in
                                            front of his love rival.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing looked at him coldly, saying: “Do you know how many years I have
                                            loved Tian’er? Let me tell you… from the day she was born, she was already
                                            destined to be become my wife, the wife of the Lion Prince Gu YingBing.
                                            Since a young age, I have cared for her, protected her, not yet her suffer
                                            the slightest bit of pain or agony. With her mischievous nature, even though
                                            I was punished severely by Master several times, I was happy to do so. Every
                                            day, I watcher her grow up, watched her grow more and more beautiful, and my
                                            heart was filled with love and hope, knowing that she would be my wife
                                            eventually. Yet… you, you bastard, you dared to trick such a innocent girl
                                            who knows nothing about the world, stealing her heart from me and even her
                                            body. However, no matter what, I will not give up, and I will win her heart
                                            back.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing spat out another mouthful of blood and said: “Bullshit. Your so
                                            called love is a one-sided one. What do you mean trick? Tian’er loves me,
                                            and I love her as well, and we have spent a few years together. You will
                                            never win her heart back, she will only be mine, as I am hers. Even if you
                                            kill me, you will never change that fact. Even if I die, I will still live
                                            on in Tian’er’s heart. Come on then! Kill me… hahaha”</p>
                                        <p>That stubborn and obstinate nature within Zhou Weiqing’s nature was totally
                                            stimulated. At that moment, he totally forgot about being afraid of death.
                                            Even if he could not defeat this love rival in front of him, he would not
                                            bow down, would not show any signs of weakness and back down.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing slammed his foot into Zhou Weiqing’s abdomen in a savage kick,
                                            sending him flying back. In a flash, he disappeared and reappeared in mid
                                            air, catching up to Zhou Weiqing, slamming continuous blows onto the flying
                                            body. At that moment, Zhou Little Fatty had become a true sandbag.</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty!” Shangguan Fei’er’s eyes also reddened, and she unleashed all
                                            her power at once, not caring about defense, fully pitting her life in
                                            reckless abandon attacks against the Heavenly King Stage powerhouse in front
                                            of her. Alas, he was a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse after all, and in a
                                            short time she could not break through his defenses.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a sudden soft sound rang out together with a flash of
                                            silver light. The Lion Prince, who had been beating on Zhou Weiqing,
                                            suddenly froze in midair, the Divine Guardian Angel around his body actually
                                            shattering.</p>
                                        <p>In that abrupt danger, Gu YingBing displayed his sheer strength and power,
                                            forcefully moving his body at the last possible moment to avoid his critical
                                            vital points from getting hit. In the end, the silver light was only able to
                                            leave a deep cut along his ribs, blood welling from the injury.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, the one which had taken action so suddenly was the Silver Emperor
                                            Little Red Bean, Zhou Weiqing’s last ace in hand.</p>
                                        <p>With a loud thud, Zhou Weiqing landed back onto the ground, blood spewing
                                            from his mouth, even leaking from his nose and ears. He had already been
                                            injured previously, and the new series of blows caused him fall into semi
                                            consciousness, only a sheen of red in front of his eyes. Both his arms and
                                            his left leg were broken, and only his unbelievably tough Demonic Right Leg
                                            was tough enough to stay unbroken, though at least five of his ribs were
                                            broken. Even so, he was still alive. No one knew why, Gu YingBing could have
                                            easily finished him off, but did not end it there and then.</p>
                                        <p>“Hmph. A puny little Silver Emperor…” Gu YingBing had been injured, but it
                                            was nothing to a powerhouse like him. Still, the ferocious light in his eyes
                                            flashed even stronger, and his hands circled suddenly in mid air, a powerful
                                            golden red light spreading out, seeming to congeal the air in a fifty yard
                                            radius. The next moment, the gold red light seemed to form a net, forcefully
                                            stopping the Silver Emperor Little Red Bean as it was enclosed within.</p>
                                        <p>“Die!” Two beams of gold light shot forth from Gu YingBing’s eyes, landing
                                            directly on Little Red Bean. Originally, it had been attempting to break
                                            free of the encirclement with the Spatial Rend and Silver Emperor Lightning
                                            Pierce, but its body froze, shuddering violently before going limp. The net
                                            of light seemed to collapse inwards on it, and with a terrifying and
                                            disgusting sound, Little Red Bean’s little body was totally shredded by the
                                            terrifying net, falling into little bits of meat and blood, indubitably
                                            dead.</p>
                                        <p>A max level Zong Stage Heavenly Beast… yet it seemed to frail and weak in
                                            front of Gu YingBing’s Divine and Spirit Dual Saint Attributes. It was clear
                                            that if he really wanted to kill Zhou Weiqing, perhaps even if there were
                                            ten Zhou Weiqings, they would all be dead now.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing lifted his hand towards Zhou Weiqing, and a powerful suction
                                            force dragged his body right in front of him.</p>
                                        <p>“Gu YingBing, if you dare kill him, our Heaven’s Expanse Palace will not let
                                            the matter go so easily. Weiqing is our Heaven’s Expanse Palace son in law…”
                                            Shangguan Fei’er shouted angrily.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing looked at her coldly. “If I wanted to kill him, even if he is the
                                            son of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master, so what? He would still die
                                            now…”</p>
                                        <p></p>
