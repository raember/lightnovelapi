                                            his chest. Before Shangguan Bing’er could react, another *pssh* sound rang
                                            out as the arrow sank in and blood once again spurted out.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing showed his savage side, as he grit his teeth. Despite the sweat
                                            beading on his forehead, he stood there resolutely, not moving an inch, as
                                            if the 2 arrows weren’t stuck in him. Once again, his hands moved towards
                                            the quiver, taking out another arrow. “No more!” Shangguan Bing’er finally
                                            caved in, and in a green flash of light, her hands were grasping hold of the
                                            hand holding the arrow.</p>
                                        <p>“You fool! Aren’t you afraid of death? Afraid of pain? Why must you hurt
                                            yourself?” Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s upper half of the body, which was now
                                            soaked in fresh blood, the anger in her heart had long since evaporated. She
                                            raised her hands to try and seal the blood flow, but Zhou Weiqing grabbed
                                            her hands instead..</p>
                                        <p>“Let me explain to you first; once that is done, we can treat it.” Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s voice was very soft and gentle, looking at her with love in his
                                            eyes. All that he had done was a gamble, a gamble that she also held some
                                            reciprocal feelings for him, that she would stop him. It worked, and when
                                            Shangguan Bing’er had cried, he knew he had finally succeeded.</p>
                                        <p>“No, do you want to die? Let me stop the blood first, then I’ll listen to
                                            your explanation okay?” Shangguan Bing’er said between sobs, pulling her
                                            hands from Zhou Weiqing’s grasp. She pulled out the arrow from his hand and
                                            threw it away, then placed her hands at his wounds and circulated her
                                            Heavenly Energy into his body, repelling the arrows embedded in his body
                                            with a deft touch before quickly sealing the blood flow.</p>
                                        <p>She then tore his sleeve away, and when she saw the wounds, she drew a sharp
                                            breath; they were extremely deep.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, she did not know that if Zhou Weiqing had not activated his
                                            Heavenly Jewels and absorbed the black pearl’s evil aura, he would have died
                                            by now. Originally, when he had first swallowed the black pearl, a drop of
                                            blood on his fist had already dissolved a large Stars Tree, furthermore he
                                            had bled out so much. Shangguan Bing’er quickly took out a clean white shirt
                                            from her backpack, tearing it into strips, and used it to bandage his wounds
                                            carefully.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing just stood there, watching as she bandaged him. At this moment,
                                            his tensed breath was finally relieved, and the serious eyes turned lively
                                            once again.</p>
                                        <p>Quickly bandaging his wounds, Shangguan Bing’er’s forehead was full of sweat
                                            as well, and her hands stained with Zhou Weiqing’s blood.</p>
                                        <p>Let’s go to the side to rest.” She looked up at Zhou Weiqing, only to see his
                                            pale, ashen face, his eyes closed as he started swaying. Shocked, she
                                            quickly held on to his other arm, but as soon as she did so, his body
                                            crumpled, falling into her arms.</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty, Little Fatty, don’t scare me!” Shangguan Bing’er quickly held
                                            him. Even when facing stronger enemies, or when they were facing the
                                            direwolf pack, he had not sustained such heavy injuries; yet for her sake,
                                            Zhou Weiqing who feared death so much had actually inflicted such heavy self
                                            injuries, what more was there to say?</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er quickly helped him to the roadside, seating herself against
                                            a tree while holding Zhou Weiqing in her embrace.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes feebly, giving a forced smile as he said:
                                            “Bing’er, I’m alright. As long as you’re willing to listen to my
                                            explanation, I can even take another two more arrows.” This wasn’t him
                                            spouting nonsense; with his body’s current physique, as long as he wasn’t
                                            stabbed in the heart, he would be able to recover from two more stabs. At
                                            this moment of weakness for Shangguan Bing’er, if he didn’t take advantage
                                            of the situation, he wouldn’t be called Zhou Weiqing. Nestled in her soft
                                            embrace, although his shoulder hurt so much that it felt numb, his heart
                                            felt as if it had eaten honey and was indescribably comfortable.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s tears fell like pearls from a cut necklace as she said:
                                            “Little Fatty, you don’t need to speak anymore. I trust you. Even if you
                                            lied to me, I’ll forgive you.” Before today, even during the time when they
                                            were facing the Forest Direwolves and Zhou Weiqing had tried to sacrifice
                                            his life for hers, her heart was still confused; she had not known how she
                                            felt about him.</p>
                                        <p>However, just in that instant when Zhou Weiqing had resolutely stabbed the
                                            arrow into his own body, Shangguan Bing’er felt as if a knife had stabbed
                                            right into her heart as well. Only then did she realise that this rascally,
                                            shameless and brazen fellow had somehow imprinted himself in her heart.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing slowly closed his eyes, as his voice grew serious. Still weak,
                                            he said faintly: “Bing’er, I really did not lie to you, I never have. Do you
                                            remember, when you first asked me about my past, I said I did not want to
                                            lie to you, and asked you not to ask further. I admit that I hid my past,
                                            but I would not lie to you, at that time if I had told you my identity,
                                            would you have allowed me to stay in the army camp? I was afraid you would
                                            have shipped me back to my father.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er bit her lips and said: “But… you already have a fiancee,
                                            yet you behaved as if nothing was happening to stay beside me. Do you think
                                            you’re treating her fairly? Treating me fairly? How can you even face
                                            us?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said bitterly: “I have never treated Difuya as my fiancee, how
                                            could I even speak of treating her or facing her? A woman who would try to
                                            kill her own fiance, do you think I would even think of her? Do you know why
                                            I happened to swallow the black pearl originally?” As such, he told
                                            Shangguan Bing’er about how he chanced upon Difuya bathing, and how he had
                                            been left for the dead.</p>
                                        <p>“... After I ran away, I left a message for my father asking him to help me
                                            reject the marriage. After all, she doesn’t fancy me, which I can
                                            understand; nor do I fancy her. No matter how beautiful a woman is, if her
                                            heart is not good, how can I accept her? She has never been in my heart, and
                                            the person I really love is you. You’re so gentle, and kind; while Difuya, I
                                            only caught a glimpse of her bathing, and didn’t really see her naked, yet
                                            she already tried to kill me. On the other hand, for you, even after I did
                                            that to you, you thought about the bigger picture and restrained yourself
                                            from killing me, even though you were more than justified to do so, and you
                                            even helped train me to become a Heavenly Jewel Master. Ever since that day,
                                            your kindness and compassion had touched me, and after spending so much time
                                            with you, I have really fallen for you. Bing’er, I really am no longer able
                                            to live without you.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er flushed and stammered: “But… Admiral Zhou… did he manage to
                                            reject the betrothal?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “My dad is fond of his face, and it won’t be easy for him
                                            to do that in front of godfather. I’ll personally tell godfather when we
                                            return. Bing’er don’t worry, even if I have wives in the future, it would
                                            never be Difuya.” [1. gg]</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er nodded gently, saying: “En…” However, almost instantly, she
                                            realised something was wrong, and her eyes widened. “What did you say?? You
                                            still want to have other wives??!”</p>
                                        <p>“Errr… I misspoke… … Aiiyaahhh, my wound hurts!” Zhou Weiqing’s head lolled
                                            to the side, his face pale as he ‘fainted’ then. When he fainted, he still
                                            didn’t forget to position his head properly, landing right in her bosom.
                                            While his feelings were real, it wouldn’t extinguish his rascally
                                            nature.</p>
                                        <p>At first, he was just enjoying the feeling of being pressed against Shangguan
                                            Bing’er’s soft body; the feeling was just too great. However, his blood loss
                                            was too great, and before long, he had really fallen asleep.</p>
                                        <p>After an unknown amount of time had passed, Zhou Weiqing finally awoke. As
                                            soon as he opened his eyes, he found himself lying down with Shangguan
                                            Bing’er’s lap as his pillow, with some of her spare clothing covering him
                                            like a quilt. Warmth flooded his heart, and he couldn’t help but wish that
                                            the moment would last forever.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s small hand rested on his forehead: “You’re finally awake,
                                            there’s no more fever. How do you feel?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing twitched comfortably on her leg, and seeing her concerned look,
                                            his heart was filled with tenderness. Moving his shoulder tentatively, he
                                            found that although it still hurt, it was already much better. He knew that
                                            his recuperative abilities were a lot stronger than a normal human’s due to
                                            the black pearl, as evidenced from the previous time he was injured by the
                                            Direwolf King’s attacks.</p>
                                        <p>“Bing’er, you won’t leave me again right?” Zhou Weiqing lifted up his right
                                            hand to hold hers.</p>
                                        <p>“Mmmn.” Shangguan Bing’er nodded softly, a blush tinting her cheeks.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing struggled to get up, then unreservedly leaning into her, he put
                                            his right arm on her shoulders to support himself as he leaned in
                                            closer…</p>
                                        <p>As his face grew closer, the flush on Shangguan Bing’er’s beautiful face grew
                                            deeper, and she said softly: “Knock it off, you’re still injured.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing immediately seized upon her word gleefully and said: “Does that
                                            mean, as soon as my injuries are healed, we can…”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er chided him reproachfully: “Can’t you be more proper!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Being proper is not my style! After all, they
                                            say that girls only fall for bad boys. Bing’er, do you know that today’s my
                                            birthday, my 14th birthday. Previously, at Master Huyan’s place, when I said
                                            that there were 2 more months before I reached 14, I was just randomly
                                            giving a time. In truth, today is my actual birthday. How about giving me a
                                            kiss as a birthday present?”</p>
                                        <p>“Fourteen…” Hearing his age, Shangguan Bing’er’s expression grew a little
                                            strange, and she put her hand to his mouth and said: “Little Fatty, you’re
                                            just fourteen years old, and not fully grown up yet. We shouldn’t be too
                                            intimate, or it’ll affect your growth.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was dumbfounded, he had not expected that he had dropped a rock
                                            on his own foot [2. Lol, couldn’t help laughing at his predicament. Anyway,
                                            that was another literal translation of 搬起石头砸了自己的脚, which pretty much means
                                            he shot himself in the foot], the expression on his face turned weird.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er thought he was angry, and gave him a quick peck on his
                                            cheeks. “Happy Birthday Little Fatty, I’m already yours, so I’ll wait for
                                            you to grow up.”</p>
                                        <p>“I…” Zhou Weiqing didn’t know what to say to that, having a very complicated
                                            feeling in his heart, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p>
                                        <p>As it was already four hours later, the two decided to continue on their
                                            journey, though it was only after Shangguan Bing’er had verified that Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s wounds were pretty much healed before agreeing to continue
                                            traveling. Of course, they were no longer chasing one after the other, but
                                            were running hand in hand.</p>
