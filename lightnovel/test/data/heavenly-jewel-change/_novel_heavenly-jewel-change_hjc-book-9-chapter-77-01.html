                                            had been slapped because he had mistaken the identity of his wife...</p>
                                        <p>Having a thick skin had a great benefit, by the time Zhou Weiqing returned to
                                            his room, he had already dismissed the teasing jokes.</p>
                                        <p>Power was the best way to prove himself, and only if he could display his
                                            true power, would Shangguan Tianyue accept him.</p>
                                        <p>The Second Palace Master of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, what kind of status
                                            and power was that? He should be at least a Heavenly King Stage or higher,
                                            perhaps even emperor or god stage! No wonder he looked down on such a lowly
                                            three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master like himself. In the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace, at his age and still being three-Jeweled, there should be at least a
                                            few hundred or more.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, it was impossible for him to raise his Heavenly Energy in a short
                                            period of time, and he had just reached the first stage of Heavenly Shen
                                            Energy not long ago. Even though the Immortal Deity Technique was extremely
                                            powerful, and now that he had completed the second portion of it, he had
                                            thirteen energy whirlpools working all the time, allowing his cultivation,
                                            training and even recovery rate to be much faster than any ordinary Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters. Even the Immortal Deity Shield had improved. Despite that, it
                                            would still take time and effort to continue improving, especially since he
                                            had not raised to the 13th stage on his own effort, but due to Fat Cat’s
                                            evolving. Up to now, he still had not figured out what exactly had happened
                                            yet.</p>
                                        <p>Since his Heavenly Energy could not be increased in such a short period of
                                            time, there was only two methods for him to improve his combat prowess and
                                            power. One, was to use the Demonic Change, and the other was combat skill,
                                            and to improve his Skills.</p>
                                        <p>What was his greatest advantage? Naturally, it was his six attribute
                                            Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewel. Tang Xian was Shangguan Tianyue’s
                                            wife, and as a powerhouse herself, she had naturally seen a lot as well. If
                                            even she had been surprised to see his own six Attribute Alexandrite Cat’s
                                            Eye, that meant that such an Elemental Jewel would be extremely rare, even
                                            for Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
                                        <p>Among his six main attributes, the ones he used the most were the darkness,
                                            spatial, wind and lightning attributes. Of the four attributes, there were
                                            twelve skills he had stored in total, and amongst those only the Darkness
                                            Seal Skill Blood Rites was not able to be used in direct combat. Adding the
                                            Absolute Delay of the Time Attribute, he usually had twelve skills which he
                                            used often in his combat.</p>
                                        <p>Earlier, when they had all been on the road to ZhongTian City, Zhou Weiqing
                                            had sought the advice of Lin TianAo, Xiao Yan and the rest regarding how to
                                            make full use of his Stored Skills. At that time, Xiao Yan had told him:
                                            When studying a book you read it a hundred times, and you will comprehend
                                            it; when training a skill, you practice a thousand times, and you will
                                            comprehend it [1. Alright, that’s super clunky, but you guys should get the
                                            point of this direct translation]</p>
                                        <p>At that time, when Zhou Weiqing had heard it, he had not thought much about
                                            it. To practice each skill a thousand times continuously without stopping,
                                            wasn’t that a huge amount of time? Furthermore, Xiao Yan had said, the
                                            thousand times had to be done without any breaks in between in order to gain
                                            the benefit, to fully understand and grasp the true meaning and usage of the
                                            Skill. Yet, each time one used a skill, it was a drain on Heavenly Energy.
                                            For any Heavenly Jewel Master, to even be able to use about a dozen or so
                                            Skills continuously without running out of Heavenly Energy, that was already
                                            considered very good. With specific Consolidated Equipment to reduce the
                                            amount of Heavenly Energy needed, they would still at most be only to use
                                            about two dozen Skills continuously. After expending all their Heavenly
                                            Energy, they would have to cultivate and meditate to recover; in order to
                                            continuously practice a skill for a thousand times, even three days and
                                            nights of continuous training would likely be insufficient. Without sleeping
                                            or eating for that amount of time, who could take it?</p>
                                        <p>At that time, Lin TianAo had given his opinion that the effects of such a
                                            training method were extremely good, but the side effects were also quite
                                            huge, taking a large toll on the mind and body of the practitioner.
                                            Generally, every person would only go through this once on a skill, and not
                                            more than once, as the first time usually had the best effect. Of course,
                                            most Heavenly Jewel Masters placed a greater focus on cultivating their
                                            Heavenly Energy, and not spending time on such tempering and training of
                                            skills. Not only was this method of training boring and tough, the constant
                                            lack of sleep and eating would take a huge toll on the body, causing long
                                            term damage. At that time, Lin TianAo had suggested that given sufficient
                                            time and energy, going through all his skills once over would still be
                                            good.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Zhou Weiqing had thought of trying this method once they returned
                                            from the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. However, at this moment, provoked by
                                            Shangguan Tianyue, he immediately thought of this training method. Perhaps,
                                            this was the only way for him to raise his power in a mere three days. <i>Hmph,
                                                wasn’t it just a thousand times of using a skill? For Bing’er, I’ll risk
                                                everything!</i></p>
                                        <p>As he thought up to this point, Zhou Weiqing charged out of his room, running
                                            to the dining hall of the inn to have a large meal. After which, he carried
                                            two large bottles of drinking water back to his room, and told everyone else
                                            not to disturb his training before he started on his first journey of this
                                            rather ‘crazy’ training method.</p>
                                        <p>Although he couldn’t stop during the training, without food and sleep, he
                                            still needed to take a quick drink once in awhile. After all, without water,
                                            he probably wouldn’t last more than a day of such intense training.</p>
                                        <p>After all the preparation, Zhou Weiqing went through all his skills in his
                                            mind, finally deciding upon the Spatial Rend as the Skill he would train.
                                            The reason why he chose it was because it was the highest rated skill out of
                                            all his skills, and furthermore it was a skill that held both offensive and
                                            defensive capabilities in one. More importantly, it was also part of the
                                            fused skill together with the Wind Attribute Silver Emperor Wing Slash,
                                            which was his most powerful offensive skill!</p>
                                        <p>Without question, to temper this skill first would give him the greatest
                                            benefit.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing’s greatest advantage was his Immortal Deity Technique,
                                            which did not require him to sit down and meditate to cultivate his Heavenly
                                            Energy. As long as was using and expending Heavenly Energy, the energy
                                            whirlpools at his Death Acupuncture Points would constantly draw in energy
                                            from the atmosphere, replenishing his Heavenly Energy and constantly
                                            building up and improving. Once a sufficient amount had built up, it would
                                            be followed by breaking through the next Death Acupuncture Point, thus
                                            breaking through to the next level. Although each time he attempted break
                                            through was nigh tantamount to dying once, it was without question that it
                                            was a much simpler process than any other cultivation method. As such, even
                                            when Zhou Weiqing was tempering his skills, it would not affect the speed of
                                            his cultivation of Heavenly Energy!</p>
                                        <p>Even Zhou Weiqing did not realise that he had stumbled upon the training and
                                            cultivation method that suited him the most!</p>
                                        <p>A bout of silver light appeared around Zhou Weiqing’s hands, as the Spatial
                                            Rend drew a long three chi rend in space. It lasted for about three seconds
                                            before slowly disappearing.</p>
                                        <p>To Temper the Skill, it was not just a matter of continuous using the skill,
                                            but while using the skill, one had to feel the profound secrets and
                                            mechanics behind the skill, to fully understand it.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing sensed the changes of the Spatial Rend, he slowly realised
                                            that when the Spatial Rend appeared, it would have a great suction effect on
                                            the other attribute elements in the air, yet it did not have any such effect
                                            on actual objects. However, it was like a strange shield, if an actual
                                            object attacked it, then the Spatial Rend would actually have a powerful
                                            cutting effect, even normal metals would be sliced apart instantly. If this
                                            was used on a human body, it wasn’t necessary to describe the sheer power
                                            and effectiveness of that.</p>
                                        <p>That was also one of the reasons why the Spatial Rend could fuse together
                                            with the Silver Emperor Wing Slash to increase the offensive power. After
                                            all, a King Stage Skill like the Silver Emperor Wing Slash already had great
                                            destructive powers, and was extremely sharp, adding the Spatial Rend’s
                                            cutting powers and the explosive effect after the Space itself was torn
                                            apart, naturally the increase in power was so strong.</p>
                                        <p>Three seconds quickly passed, and Zhou Weiqing released the Spatial Rend
                                            again the second time. He constantly put his senses to the max in feeling
                                            the skill as he used it over and over again, as Spatial Rend after Spatial
                                            Rend appeared in the air in front of him. His Heavenly Energy also started
                                            draining at high speeds, and his thirteen energy whirlpools at his Death
                                            Acupuncture Points started whirling at full speeds, aiding his recovery.</p>
                                        <p>Without any stopping, he continued releasing the Spatial Rends. Zhou Weiqing
                                            also wanted to try out how many he could release continuously without
                                            rest.</p>
                                        <p>The cooldown of the Spatial Rend skill was about six seconds. That was to
                                            say, after using a Spatial Rend, which lasted three seconds, he would have
                                            to wait three more seconds. That was already his maximum output of the
                                            skill, and corresponding Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst all of Zhou Weiqing’s skills, the Spatial Rend was not the one which
                                            expended the most Heavenly Energy. This was also one of the reasons why its
                                            rating was so high. It wasn’t that the higher level the skill, the greater
                                            the toll on Heavenly Energy. The greater the power with the lower
                                            expenditure, the greater the rating the skill would have.</p>
                                        <p>After using the skill repeatedly, Zhou Weiqing discovered that as he
                                            continuously used the skill, every nine times that he used it, the recovery
                                            rate of his energy whirlpools would recover enough for him to use the skill
                                            one more time. This was of course impossible for normal Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters, but with his Immortal Deity Technique, he managed to do so.</p>
                                        <p>After using it seventeen times, Zhou Weiqing finally depleted his Heavenly
                                            Energy. That feat was accomplished without using any Consolidated Equipment
                                            to aid him! Furthermore, the skill was currently at the three-Jeweled stage,
                                            but Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy was only at the thirteenth level, still
                                            relatively far from the sixteenth stage! To be able to use the Spatial Rend
                                            seventeen times, that was indeed an impressive number.</p>
                                        <p>More importantly, at this point, Zhou Weiqing did not need to sit down to
                                            meditate and recover his Heavenly Energy. He just needed to stand there
                                            waiting, and as soon as he had sufficient energy, he would release another
                                            Spatial Rend instantly. This also caused his Heavenly Energy to be in a
                                            constant state of depletion, with his thirteen energy whirlpools to be at
                                            the maximum draw.</p>
                                        <p>Just depending on the energy whirlpools to recover Heavenly Energy, Zhou
                                            Weiqing could use the skill once every minute!</p>
