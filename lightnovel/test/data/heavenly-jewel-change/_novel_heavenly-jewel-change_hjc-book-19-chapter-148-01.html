                                            but it was definitely a minority. Of course, amongst these ruffian soldiers,
                                            a large majority of them had been actually sentenced in the first place due
                                            to unruly behavior while drunk, thus ending up in the Ruffian Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the army rules actually banned drinking. As a result, this promise
                                            of Zhou Weiqing’s was even more attractive to these ruffian soldiers than
                                            giving them gold!</p>
                                        <p>They all enjoyed the piping hot, delicious meal. Although the wolf meat was
                                            not exactly the best tasting, in their excited, happy mood, everything just
                                            tasted better.</p>
                                        <p>There was no wastage; the meat they could not finished was cooked and packed
                                            up, along with a large amount of other rations and supplies, filling up more
                                            than five hundred horse carts, which Zhou Weiqing had requisitioned from the
                                            Seventh Legion a few days ago.</p>
                                        <p>The titanium alloy arrows, arrow tips and javelins which had been shot out
                                            previously were all recollected; after all these were all extremely
                                            expensive and valuable. As long as they could be reused or re-purposed, they
                                            naturally would not waste such important resources, or extra gold right?</p>
                                        <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to give the order to move out, a familiar
                                            piping voice rang out in his ear. “Little Fatty, ask the others to head out
                                            first. You stay here first.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing the voice, Zhou Weiqing was overjoyed. Wasn’t that his new teacher,
                                            the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, Long Shiya?</p>
                                        <p>He quickly asked Shangguan Fei’er to get Wei Feng and the others to lead the
                                            entire Peerless Battalion to the Seventh Legion, and he would join them
                                            later.</p>
                                        <p>The mighty contingent of the Peerless Battalion, carts in tow, moved like a
                                            great flood in the direction of the northern army command base. When they
                                            had disappeared from Zhou Weiqing’s sight, there was a flash before his
                                            eyes, and two men appeared by his side.</p>
                                        <p>One was the familiar rotund sight of the Large Fatty Long Shiya, and the
                                            other was another seemingly middle aged man of about the same age as Long
                                            Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>The middle aged man was not exactly handsome, but he had a unique air about
                                            him, as if a well polished jade with an inner shine, giving a profound deep
                                            feel about him. He was also wearing a similar black clothing as Long Shiya,
                                            and his bearing and aura did not seem to lose out to Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>“Master.” Zhou Weiqing bowed respectfully towards Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya smiled faintly and nodded, saying: “Not bad, not bad at all. That
                                            fight earlier, you did very well. Very effective application of your Skills
                                            indeed. However, your victory was once again due to the surprise element of
                                            your unique Skill. Come, let your Teacher test you on your fruits of
                                            cultivation all this time. Six Ultimate Transform Skill, go.”</p>
                                        <p>This Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was indeed a brusque and straightforward
                                            person. Having just met his disciple after all this time, he was teaching
                                            and testing him once more, not even introducing him to the middle aged man
                                            beside him first.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing agreed, lifting his right hand up. The Six Ultimate Transform
                                            Skill was the beginning level arts of Long Shiya’s Six Ultimate Skill
                                            Manipulation Arts. The more Zhou Weiqing dwelved into the intricacies of the
                                            Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, the more miraculous he realised it
                                            was, and the more respect and awe he held for this teacher of his. After
                                            all, Long Shiya had come up with this technique all by himself after much
                                            research and training.</p>
                                        <p>A ball green light appeared around Zhou Weiqing’s palm, a pure green that was
                                            not particularly intense. His fingers moved slightly, as if massaging the
                                            ball of green light energy, and in the next moment, it turned into a Wind
                                            Blade.</p>
                                        <p>The Wind Blade was extremely small, much smaller than the ball of green light
                                            had previously been. The crescent shaped wind blade’s length was only three
                                            inches, but despite its minute size, it was extremely solid and well formed,
                                            glowing in green gold light. If not for the swirling movement of the light,
                                            any onlooker might think it was an actual knife in his hands.</p>
                                        <p>A hint of surprise flashed in Long Shiya’s eyes, though Zhou Weiqing did not
                                            notice it as his full concentration was on the energy in his palm.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why the green Wind Blade was so small was not because Zhou Weiqing
                                            did not use much Heavenly Energy, but because of the sheer amount of
                                            compression of energy upon it. With Zhou Weiqing’s current cultivation
                                            level, if he did not use the compact compression skill of the Six Ultimate
                                            Skill Manipulation Arts, he could not possibly have his Wind Blade so small
                                            and compact. He had not Stored this Wind Blade Skill, and he was making use
                                            of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts to use his Wind Attribute
                                            Heavenly Energy to imitate the Wind Attribute Skill. If he made any slight
                                            error in his control, that Wind Blade would immediately dissipate into
                                            Heavenly Energy once more.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s five fingers continued moving in a strange rhythm, and the
                                            Wind Blade once again formed back into the ball of green light into his
                                            palm, and it slowly warped to a bluish purple colour. In the entire process,
                                            Zhou Weiqing did not dismiss the Heavenly Energy and re-release it, instead
                                            transforming it entirely from the green light, and it was still the original
                                            ball of Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>When the green light had fully transformed into the bluish purple light, Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s face grew more serious. It was now Lightning Attribute Heavenly
                                            Energy, which was even more difficult to control than the Wind Attribute
                                            Heavenly Energy. As the bluish purple light flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s hands,
                                            his five fingers began to move with increased speed, slowly causing the ball
                                            of light to form into a bluish purple lightning pearl.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, after Zhou Weiqing had transformed the Heavenly Energy ball to the
                                            Lightning Attribute, he had to resort to some trickery as well. After all,
                                            the Lightning Attribute was quite a lot more active than the Wind Attribute,
                                            and Zhou Weiqing was not able to control it to form anything else. However,
                                            it was a lot easier for him to form a Lightning Pearl, as it whirled around,
                                            it was easier to just forcefully compress the Lightning Attribute. More so,
                                            Zhou Weiqing had the Dark Demon God Lightning Skill, and that definitely
                                            helped him in forming that Lightning Pearl.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the Lightning Pearl form, not only did the surprise in Long Shiya’s
                                            eyes deepen, even the middle aged man beside him also showed some surprise.
                                            After all, the Lightning Attribute was a rare and powerful Attribute,
                                            considered one of the Attributes with the most explosive power. To be able
                                            to control the Lightning Attribute to such a degree was not easy indeed.</p>
                                        <p>The middle aged man’s voice rang in Long Shiya’s ears: “This little fellow
                                            has only learned from you for less than half a year?! His talent for
                                            Heavenly Energy control is indeed impressive!”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya did not reply, and on the surface his expression did not change as
                                            his gaze fixated upon Zhou Weiqing’s hands.</p>
                                        <p>The bluish purple Lightning Pearl slowly grew larger before it slowly
                                            dissipated back into the ball of Heavenly Energy. Once again, the
                                            transformation process started. This time, sweat beaded on Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            forehead as his eyes widened. It was clear that he was fully focused on the
                                            transformation of energy in his hands.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Long Shiya had only asked him to show the Six Ultimate Transform
                                            Skill, which was to transform his Heavenly Energy freely among his Six
                                            Attributes. However, what Zhou Weiqing was doing was not just transforming
                                            his Heavenly Energy, but actually imitating one Skill for each Attribute
                                            before transforming to the next Attribute, and so on. That was a lot more
                                            difficult than Long Shiya’s original request.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why Zhou Weiqing chose to do so was that he wanted to test
                                            himself, to see how far his control had progressed.The other reason was that
                                            he wanted to prove himself to his teacher, that he had not slackened off at
                                            all for the past six months and had been training with all his might. Of
                                            course, another factor was that Zhou Weiqing’s judgement of human nature was
                                            always accurate and pinpoint as usual. Perhaps if it was only Long Shiya
                                            alone here, he might not have gone this further step. However, now that Long
                                            Shiya had brought a friend along, with an outsider here, the stronger and
                                            more impressive Zhou Weiqing could display himself, it would bring even more
                                            face to Long Shiya. To bring face to his teacher, naturally Zhou Weiqing
                                            would not hesitate to go further.</p>
                                        <p>This little cunning ploy of his, naturally Long Shiya could see through it.
                                            However, even if he saw through it, Long Shiya was still extremely
                                            delighted. Having his disciple work so hard to bring him face, how could he
                                            not be happy?</p>
                                        <p>Silver light slowly consolidated. This time, it did not form into the shape
                                            of a ball of light. If we were to compare all of Zhou Weiqing’s Six
                                            Attributes, it would be undoubtedly the Spatial Attribute that he had the
                                            most control over. After all, not counting his status as a Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master, just amongst his Skills, his Blink Skill was the optimum
                                            for escaping, while his Spatial Rend Skill was also extremely powerful in
                                            offense and defense, one of his most commonly used ones. Towards these two
                                            Skills, he had spent the most time and effort in improving, and as a result
                                            his understanding and control towards the Spatial Attribute Heavenly Energy
                                            was the deepest. Even so, after transforming the Heavenly Energy from
                                            Lightning Attribute to Spatial Attribute and coalescing it into a Skill, it
                                            caused sweat to form all around his head.</p>
                                        <p>A dim light flashed as the silver light fully consolidated, and sweat began
                                            to drip from the sides of Zhou Weiqing’s forehead. However, he had
                                            succeeded, and the thick silver light began to elongate, and if one were to
                                            look closely, right in the middle of the silver was a smatter of black. This
                                            was not just an ordinary compression of Heavenly Energy, clearly one of the
                                            Skills that Zhou Weiqing had Stored on his own… the Spatial Rend.</p>
                                        <p>However, this time this Spatial Rend was clearly not unleashed from his own
                                            Stored Skill, but imitated out through control of his own Heavenly Energy.
                                            Of course, this was another minor trick, as he already had such a Skill and
                                            was much more familiar with it. Still, even if it was some trickery, being
                                            able to control Heavenly Energy to such a degree was truly a feat for his
                                            cultivation level.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the eyes of the middle aged man beside Long Shiya flashed with
                                            a brilliant light, as he grasped Long Shiya’s large shoulders hard, a
                                            fawning smile at his mouth.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya glared at him. How could he not understand what his good friend
                                            meant? Before coming here, he had not revealed Zhou Weiqing’s Attributes to
                                            this best bro of his, exactly because he was afraid that he would constantly
                                            bug him about it. Long Shiya knew how important those Attributes that Zhou
                                            Weiqing had were for a Consolidating Equipment Master. The Spatial Attribute
                                            and Wind Attribute had already been shown, and since this middle aged man
                                            also knew that Zhou Weiqing was part of the Legacy of Strength, one could
                                            imagine how pleasing Zhou Weiqing was to the eye for him. His actions
                                            towards Long Shiya now were as clear as day indeed.</p>
                                        <p>Having completed the Spatial Rend Skill, Zhou Weiqing did not continue
                                            further. Instead, he took a deep breath, and on his skin, the familiar tiger
                                            tattoos started to appear as his muscles bulged out. His clear eyes also
                                            started turning bloodshot. Indeed, he was entering his Demonic Change
                                            State.</p>
                                        <p></p>
