                                            had in that instant gotten the acceptance of all his classmates. The next
                                            step of his plan would be to continually influence them throughout the next
                                            few years, causing them to feel a sense of reliance on him. Four years was a
                                            long time, and he was confident of letting these classmates around him to
                                            see him as a leader.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Bow Empire was just too weak now. After witnessing the true
                                            power of the Fei Li Empire, only then did Zhou Weiqing see the huge
                                            difference, to see how weak his own country really was. In order to
                                            strengthen it slowly, the first thing was to recruit more talents. How many
                                            Jewel Masters were there in the entire Heavenly Bow Empire? Furthermore,
                                            those commoners who could enter the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy
                                            were all extremely great talents with various individual skills… not just in
                                            terms of individual power as Jewel Masters, but also military capabilities!
                                            If he could recruit just some of them for his use, it would be the first
                                            stepping stone in his ambition of building up the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing believed that his father had originally thought like that as
                                            well. However, although his father was extremely powerful, he did not have
                                            the conditions necessary to draw in other Jewel Masters to follow him.
                                            However, Zhou Weiqing was different, with his status as a Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master, especially since his teacher Huyan Aobo had recognized his
                                            talents as a Consolidating Equipment Master as sheer genius. With such a
                                            status, he believed that he could totally draw in talents follow him. In
                                            such a school like the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy, where there
                                            were tons of talents and different genius in various fields around, if he
                                            just simply only studied for four years, that would be an immense waste of
                                            opportunity. After all, no matter how powerful, there was ultimately a limit
                                            to what a single person. Just like Admiral Zhou, as a powerful Mid Level
                                            Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, and a talented military genius to boot, he
                                            was still unable to change the fact that the Heavenly Bow Empire was in
                                            trouble, barely able to hold their enemies at bay.</p>
                                        <p>It was just because of this grand plan and ambition he had in his heart that
                                            Zhou Weiqing had sparked such a strong killing instinct in his heart after
                                            getting threatened by Ming Hua. Plans were just that - plans, and they were
                                            always subjected to the countless myriad of changes from the world around.
                                            What he had to do was to... deal with all these outside influences.</p>
                                        <p>The sense of danger that Ming Hua had brought to him had also caused him to
                                            lose his patience in slowly bringing the commoner students to his side,
                                            instead throwing out his conditions directly to the seniors. He could not
                                            afford to wait til he became a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master
                                            before starting to attract followers, as that would be way too late. To
                                            strengthen his country, it had to be done so step by step, over time. The
                                            path to him becoming a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master was still
                                            long and winding, and it would take him a long time to do so, time which the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire did not have, with the pressure from the Kalise Empire
                                            who was now supported by the Bai Da Empire.</p>
                                        <p>As for whether or not Zang Lang and the other seniors would follow him, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had no idea. As such, he needed to display not just his strength,
                                            but also his personality and attitude, and most especially his power as a
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master. To draw these talents in following him, he
                                            had to attract them with everything he could.</p>
                                        <p>Returning to the classroom, Zhou Weiqing was surprised to see that all the
                                            classmates had not left, and they were chit chatting with each other.
                                            Shangguan Bing’er was surrounded by a few of the other female students.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that Zhou Weiqing had returned, the entire classroom instantly
                                            quietened down. Zhou Weiqing realised what was up, and went up to the
                                            podium.</p>
                                        <p>Placing both his hands on the podium, he said: “Let me just say a few words,
                                            and everyone should go back to rest.”</p>
                                        <p>Everyone’s gaze fell onto Zhou Weiqing, and those who were standing also
                                            returned to their seats. Today, Zhou Weiqing had displayed his sheer combat
                                            power and his status as a Consolidating Equipment Master, in addition to the
                                            promise of helping upkeep them, all of them were looking up to him with much
                                            admiration.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had a faint smile on his face. At this moment, he looked just
                                            like a innocent, harmless boy. “Later, when all of you are registering with
                                            Kou Rui, you should clearly state your Heavenly Energy cultivation level.
                                            For Elemental Jewel Masters, if you want to Skill Store, just register with
                                            Yan Zhexi, he will be the guardian of the storage card. Every weekend,
                                            during our day’s break from the Academy, those who have registered can go
                                            together with him, and he will pay. In the future, I will be selling some
                                            extra Consolidating Equipment Scrolls to replenish the funds as well, so no
                                            worries about it running out too quickly. As for Physical Jewel Masters,
                                            when you register, do note what your Physical Jewel Attribute is, as well as
                                            what sort of route you are looking to develop to, and what sort of weapon
                                            you wish to Consolidate. In that way, I can design your Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls according to your personal needs.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he paused a moment. He could obviously see the effect of his
                                            words on the rest of the students, especially when he talked about the
                                            personalized Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, many of their eyes lit up.
                                            There were more Physical Jewel Masters than Elemental Jewel Masters, and
                                            their need for Consolidating Equipment Scrolls were extremely high, not to
                                            mention having them designed specially for their needs! This was something
                                            that not even those Heavenly Jewel Masters who submit to noble families or
                                            the Skill Storing Palace may not enjoy!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled in satisfaction and continued: “I also have another
                                            suggestion. If it is a Physical Jewel Master who does not have a single
                                            piece of Consolidated Equipment, you should register for one quickly, to
                                            ensure you have one for self protection. However, if you already have a
                                            piece of Consolidated Equipment, you might want to wait a little while and
                                            concentrate on cultivating your Heavenly Energy. Within two years, I believe
                                            I will be able to become a high level Consolidating Equipment Master.”</p>
                                        <p>“At that time, I should be able to start trying to create Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls with sockets, or even start on Consolidating Equipment
                                            Sets. Of course, those with sockets are only useful for Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters, but Consolidating Equipment Sets will be great even for ordinary
                                            Physical Jewel Masters.”</p>
                                        <p>If we were to describe the eyes of the students earlier to be fanatical, they
                                            were now dazed and dumbfounded. Consolidated Equipment with sockets?
                                            Consolidated Equipment Sets? Those things were almost myths to them, not
                                            only had they not seen them before, they had barely even dreamed about them
                                            before!</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that his speech had done his intended effect, Zhou Weiqing smiled and
                                            said: “Alright, that’s all I have to say. Of course, that is just my
                                            suggestion, if anyone is unable to wait, you can still go ahead and register
                                            for Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. I can at least guarantee you will
                                            succeed in Consolidating Equipment… if a single set isn’t able to do it,
                                            we’ll just do a second set. Bing’er, please stand up.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er started upon hearing Zhou Weiqing call upon her, but of
                                            course she wouldn’t not give him face now, and stood up.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s smile sudden disappeared and he said seriously: “All
                                            classmates, now, let me reintroduce this person to you all seriously. This
                                            beautiful young lady is Shangguan Bing’er, my wife. In the future, none of
                                            you other guys are allowed to have any designs on her… if not… heh heh.”</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty, what are you saying!” Shangguan Bing’er started in surprise,
                                            before blushing deep red and running out of the classroom.</p>
                                        <p>Kou Rui grinned and shouted out: “Sister in law!” And all the rest of the
                                            class burst out laughing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had an extraordinarily thick skin, and he did not care about the
                                            teasing, instead waving towards the rest of the class in farewell before
                                            chasing after Shangguan Bing’er. As soon as he left, Kou Rui was immediately
                                            surrounded by the rest of the classmates, everyone just so eager to register
                                            themselves. Even Yan Zhexi and Ma Qun, the two Heavenly Jewel Masters, were
                                            no different.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing ran all the way to the entrance of the academy before he finally
                                            caught up to Shangguan Bing’er. “Bing’er, slower! Wait for me!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er turned her head around, flushed totally red as she scolded
                                            him: “What were you saying just now! How can I face our classmates next
                                            time!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Who asked you to be so beautiful, so
                                            enchanting! I had to declare my ownership…”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er said exasperatedly: “What ownership? Am I an object?
                                            Hmph!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing immediately shook his head. “No, no, of course not. What I meant
                                            is, to proclaim that you own me, I am your Little Fatty after all! Look at
                                            me, I’m so handsome and suave, gentle and kind, honest yet cute, and I also
                                            know how to make Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Now, if other beauties try
                                            to chase me, what could I possibly do? This way, I can proclaim that you
                                            already own me, and know that I belong to you, who dares to try to chase me…
                                            even if they do, they’ll have to compare themselves to you right? If they
                                            try comparing themselves to you… they’ll be ashamed and run off. See, this
                                            is all for your sake!”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at his shameless proclamation, Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t help but
                                            giggle. “Gentle and kind… hahaha. I am pretty sure that many people think of
                                            you of some fierce monster.”</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that she was no longer angry, Zhou Weiqing immediately went closer to
                                            her, holding her by her slim waist as he grinned and said: “As long as my
                                            dear Bing’er doesn’t treat me as a monster, that is fine…”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er said in a serious tone: “Little Fatty, what you did today,
                                            was it to recruit all our classmates in the future to help our Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “It’s still too early to tell, but all
                                            you need to know is that I, your husband, has a long term goal in mind.
                                            Don’t worry, I will handle it well, you just need to concentrate on
                                            studying, and I will deal with the other things To be honest, just looking
                                            at the class schedule today gave me a headache… I do not have any foundation
                                            in military matters, and I doubt I can learn much from there. In the future,
                                            I’ll have to depend on you, especially for examinations… remember to let me
                                            copy!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er furrowed her brow: “Little Fatty, that will not do… How
                                            about, I help tutor you in some of  the foundations of military
                                            knowledge?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “No, I do not have the time for that.
                                            To upkeep that whole class of students, it isn’t that easy. Just creating
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for them and for sale, and cultivating my
                                            own Heavenly Energy, that will take up all of my spare time. As for
                                            studying, whatever I can pick up from classes, so be it.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er said rather worriedly: “But… you need to succeed Admiral
                                            Zhou in the future, to lead our Heavenly Bow Empire armies!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Bing’er, you haven’t understood what I meant.
                                            As a commander in chief, I feel that it isn’t totally necessary to be great
                                            in every aspect of military matters. As long as I have the ability to
                                            command a group of outstanding military talents, that would be
                                            sufficient…”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er started in surprise as she mulled through his words.
                                            Although she felt that Zhou Weiqing’s words were rather warped logic, but it
                                            did make sense in a way. Having spent the past two years in the Heavenly Bow
                                            Unit, Zhou Weiqing had changed a lot, not just in his stature, but his
                                            original scoundrel ways had also been well hidden from the world now. On the
                                            surface, he sometimes seemed arrogant, but she knew that he had just kept
                                            all his true feelings and emotions hidden. Although he wasn’t even seventeen
                                            years old yet, he was already much more mature and reserved than most
                                            adults.</p>
