                                            have pretty much sold their freedom to the Ye Family.”</p>
                                        <p>Amongst the commoner students, at least eighty percent have chosen to work
                                            under noble families or the Skill Storing Palace. Because the Ye Family has
                                            one of the largest influence in the Academy, they have managed to get many
                                            of the more outstanding seniors amongst the commoners.”</p>
                                        <p>“Thanks, brother.” Zhou Weiqing turned back with a smile, feeling a good
                                            impression about Kou Rui. He obviously had been worried about Zhou Weiqing,
                                            and had gone through the trouble about investigating the powers and
                                            influences in the entire academy. By this moment, the dozen or so commoner
                                            seniors had walked up to Ye Lou, who looked at them scornfully and said: “I,
                                            Your Father, called you all for so long, and you dared keep quiet? Did you
                                            all not eat rice?! This little brat insulted my big brother, you all better
                                            take care of him.”</p>
                                        <p>Amongst the dozen or so commoner students, some showed a sense of shame,
                                            hanging their heads low. Others looked at Zhou Weiqing, while some others
                                            glared angrily at Ye Lou.</p>
                                        <p>The senior standing at the front, looking to be the same age as Zang Lang,
                                            gave a soft sigh as she said to Zhou Weiqing: “Sorry Junior, having taken
                                            payment from them, we have no choice but to follow their orders. Could you
                                            please come with us?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood up, nodding and said: “Okay.” As he said that, he let go
                                            of Shangguan Bing'er ‘s hands and started to walk out alone.</p>
                                        <p>“I’ll go with you.” Shangguan Bing'er stood up as well, her beautiful face as
                                            still and passive as a lake. This was the first time she felt that studying
                                            here easily without any trouble might not be as easy as she had thought.
                                            Since there were more than a dozen of them, how could she let Zhou Weiqing
                                            go by himself!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a faint smile and didn't reply as he continued walking.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, count me in as well! Hmph, what so great about them, becoming dogs of
                                            the nobles just for the sake of Consolidated Equipment or Skill Storing.”
                                            Kou Rui was filled with righteous indignation as he walked out from his seat
                                            as well.</p>
                                        <p>To everyone’s massive surprise, Besides Kou Rui, two others walked out from
                                            the commoner freshmen students to stand with Zhou Weiqing. One was Ma Qun,
                                            who was wearing a face full of smiles, and the other one was a young man of
                                            average stature, looking rather cold and distant.</p>
                                        <p>Ye Lou laughed coldly and said: “Looks like this year's freshmen are really
                                            bold! Very good, it’s also a good chance to teach all you freshmen about the
                                            rules of the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy. Ding Chen, beat them
                                            up, make sure they are beaten up badly to the verge of death, but don’t kill
                                            them. Hmph, I’ll see who else dares to resist and be so arrogant.”</p>
                                        <p>The senior who had invited Zhou Weiqing out earlier was Ding Chen who Ye Lou
                                            had called out. Seeing Zhou Weiqing walk out without resistance, he sighed
                                            softly and said: “Junior, just apologise to Young Master Lou. I’ve heard of
                                            your fight with Zang Lang the other day; with your talent, the Young Master
                                            Boss of the Ye Family will not want to cause too much trouble to you without
                                            provocation.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled at him, elegantly patting away the creases on his uniform
                                            as he said passively: “You do not need to say anything else. Didn’t you say
                                            just now, having taken payment from them, you have no choice but to follow
                                            their orders? Go ahead then. To be honest, in my eyes, you’re even lower
                                            than him. As a man, if you can’t even stand up straight and tall in the
                                            world, what do you amount to?”</p>
                                        <p>Ding Chen’s face changed and he said angrily: “Junior, do not go too far.
                                            Everyone has their own issues and difficulties to face. You are also a Jewel
                                            Master, and you should know the problems we face.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “All I know is, I have my own hands and feet. If I need
                                            money, I will work hard and earn it to spend, and not be a dog. Since you’ve
                                            chosen to be a dog, there is no need to pretend in front of me and act
                                            nice.”</p>
                                        <p>His words instantly caused the dozen or so commoner seniors to reveal an
                                            angry look on their faces. Originally, they had been rather worried to show
                                            that they were under the Ye Family in front of the entire school population.
                                            However, now, they had been angered by Zhou Weiqing’s words, and united
                                            against a common enemy. Each of them quickly released their Power
                                            Jewels.</p>
                                        <p>“Well said. Since you’ve already become a dog, there’s no need to act
                                            anymore!” Ma Qun said at the side. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, he continued:
                                            “Don’t misunderstand me, I’m not helping you. I just can’t stand how these
                                            nobles do things. What is their basis of enslaving us commoners. Hmph. I,
                                            Your Father, will never submit to such things.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Not bad, you are a real man, at least you do
                                            not let down your size and growth.”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Lou said angrily with much impatience: “Ding Chen, what are you still
                                            waiting for?!”</p>
                                        <p>Ding Chen took a deep breath, a cold light flashing in his eyes as he took a
                                            step forward and punched towards Zhou Weiqing. His actions were simple but
                                            refined and well polished, as if he was a well tempered piece of steel who
                                            had been polished over and over. The fist flew towards Zhou Weiqing at a
                                            high speed, with a clear strength within. On his right wrist, three Icy Jade
                                            Physical Jewels revolved. He was a pure Strength Heavenly Jewel Master, just
                                            like Zhou Weiqing, and was also 3-Jeweled! To be considered by the Ye
                                            Family, and to be the leader of the Ye Family Commoner Students, he
                                            naturally was the strongest amongst them.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing followed suit, punching forward, the twelve energy whirlpools at
                                            his Death Acupuncture Points revolving at max speeds as his Heavenly Energy
                                            surged forth. There was a reason why he had moved away from his seat.</p>
                                        <p>With a loud *BANG*, the two fists clashed. Zhou Weiqing stood there not
                                            moving, while Ding Chen actually stumbled back three steps before barely
                                            catching his balance. His face instantly changed.</p>
                                        <p>It had to be known that Ding Chen’s Heavenly Energy was already cultivated to
                                            the second level of the Heavenly Shen Energy, and was actually two levels
                                            higher than Zhou Weiqing! However, his physical strength and power was just
                                            totally incomparable to Zhou Weiqing’s.  At this moment, he felt as his
                                            right fist was totally numb. Facing a similar 3-Jeweled Strength Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master, and with both sides not using any Consolidated Equipment or
                                            Stored Skills, how could such a result not shock him. However, that was not
                                            the end of it, and what followed next shocked him even more. After
                                            exchanging the single punch and knocking him back, Zhou Weiqing suddenly
                                            vanished. When he appeared once more, he was already right in front of Ding
                                            Chen, his right leg already smashing downwards like a massive, terrifying
                                            axe. Without question, Zhou Weiqing had just used his Blink skill and used
                                            it to get into position to use his Demonic Right Leg. After all, the opening
                                            ceremony was about to begin, and he wanted to show his might and scare off
                                            some of those who had designs on him or Shangguan Bing’er. To do so, he
                                            naturally had to win quickly and beautifully in order to have the maximum
                                            effect.</p>
                                        <p>The Blink Skill could not be measured simply by just speed - it was as if the
                                            very instant Ding Chen had stumbled backwards, Zhou Weiqing’s leg was
                                            already in front of him. Not even considering the fact that speed was not
                                            his strongest point, even if it was, he would likely not be able to dodge
                                            it. Without any choice, he could only attempt to lift both arms up in an
                                            attempt to block Zhou Weiqing’s right leg.</p>
                                        <p>“Ding Chen is ruined.” Zang Lang, who was seated amongst the other commoner
                                            students, gave a sigh as he shook his head. He had experienced the power of
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s right leg for himself, and knew very well how unbelievably
                                            strong and destructive it was. In his mind, it was some sort of Consolidated
                                            Equipment or Stored Skill, and such a terrifying power was definitely not
                                            something that Ding Chen could just take easily.</p>
                                        <p>*BAANGG*.... *Kaachaa*</p>
                                        <p>“AHHHH ---” an intense, shrill cry of pain resounded across the entire
                                            assembly hall. Ding Chen’s entire body was smashed into the floor. Just as
                                            Zang Lang had expected, he was ruined. Both his arms which had been
                                            attempting to block Zhou Weiqing’s right leg had been broken. At the same
                                            time, the leg had broken through his guard and smashed into his shoulder,
                                            breaking it along with 5 ribs! If not for the fact that Zhou Weiqing had not
                                            used his full strength and also struck to the side at the last moment, his
                                            head would have been smashed apart. In the next instant, with Zhou Weiqing
                                            as the central point, with a radius of fifty metres, everyone fell silent.
                                            Even Ye Lou who had been arrogantly calling out just a moment ago, fell
                                            silent, as if he had swallowed something and choked on it. His face was
                                            totally pale as he looked at the scene in front of him.</p>
                                        <p>No one had expected that in a clash of pure strength, Ding Chen would lose so
                                            quickly and so absolutely, nor had they expected Zhou Weiqing to be so
                                            vicious in striking. That leg alone had almost caused Ding Chen to be ruined
                                            for life. Blood poured out of Ding Chen’s mouth as he writhed on the ground,
                                            spasming.</p>
                                        <p>The other commoner seniors who had been behind Ding Chen stood there
                                            dumbfounded. None of them dared be the next to launch an attack towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Earlier, the cold and grave looking freshman youth who had stood out together
                                            with Ma Qun also narrowed his eyes in shock.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er had closed her eyes before Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic Right Leg
                                            had struck Ding Chen’s arms. She was the one who knew Zhou Weiqing’s powers
                                            the best, and she knew that directly fighting power to power with his leg
                                            would never result in a good end. When they were still in the Heavenly Bow
                                            Unit, even the 7-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master Hua Feng dared not collide
                                            directly with Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic Right Leg. Its sheer strength was
                                            already not something any normal Jewel Master could compare to. Yesterday,
                                            Ming Hua’s method of fighting with him, not allowing his right leg to touch
                                            her, was the best fighting style to deal with it.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Ding Chen who had fallen on the floor, Zhou Weiqing did not feel
                                            any sense of sympathy. “You still call yourself a Heavenly Jewel Master.
                                            That ‘Wang Ba Dan’’s Family, they really treated you well huh. Selling
                                            yourself to them, it must be really good. If I haven’t seen wrongly, you
                                            have a darkness seal within you, you’ve become just a slave. In the future,
                                            you better not appear in front of me again. Otherwise, even if you somehow
                                            manage to fix your bones, I will break them again. I do not mind if you want
                                            to become a dog, but if a dog comes barking crazily in front of me, then do
                                            not blame me for being nasty.”</p>
                                        <p>After he finished speaking, he turned to look at the other Ye Family commoner
                                            seniors who were still behind Ding Chen. “You bunch of weak willed fools are
                                            willing to become dogs, beating you up is just dirtying my foot.”</p>
                                        <p>The next moment, his body disappeared once more in a flash as he activated
                                            the Blink Skill. This time, he appeared right in front of Ye Lou, who was so
                                            surprised that he stumbled back with an ashen face, falling down onto the
                                            ground on his ass. His voice trembling, he said: “You… what are you doing?”
                                            In his eyes, Zhou Weiqing had a tyrannical, overbearing aura about him, as
                                            if he were a demon personifying plague and pestilence.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, squatting down and patting him softly on his
                                            pale face. “Relax, I’m not doing anything to you. Go back and tell your
                                            boss… next time, find a better egg to look for me. Don’t use someone useless
                                            like you. Get lost!” Ye Lou was originally thinking of dropping a final
                                            threat before leaving, but seeing Zhou Weiqing’s smiling face, his heart
                                            froze and he just didn’t dare say a word. Bringing the other two noble
                                            students along, he slunk away into the distance.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood up once more, looking towards the other twenty odd
                                            freshmen of his class, saying coldly: “I do not care, nor can I do anything
                                            about the seniors who have already made their choices. However, we will be
                                            together in the same class for the next four year. If any of you dare to bow
                                            down and submit to any noble families, you better just get lost and not let
                                            me see you in class. Otherwise, Ding Chen will be your example.”</p>
                                        <p>“How dare you say that? What’s your basis of doing so?!” The cold, distant
                                            youth standing next to Ma Qun said solemnly. “What right do you have to
                                            decide others’ fate? How we choose is our own business. Do you think your
                                            words are law in the academy? Even if we want to be dogs to nobles, that is
                                            our own choice.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
