                                            However, they have met up against an unknown force and both sides are in the
                                            midst of battle.”</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing such a news, Shen Ji started. “Outside force? Unknown? What
                                            could this force be? Where is it from?”</p>
                                        <p>“I’m sorry sir, I do not know. These outsiders seem to be extremely valiant.
                                            They are currently in a defensive position, and even though they are facing
                                            two Regiments of the WanShou Empire, they actually haven’t been run over
                                            yet. Furthermore, they seem to have many large carts in tow… from the looks
                                            of it, they might be migrating.”</p>
                                        <p>A sudden thought gripped Zhou Weiqing’s heart, and his expression changed as
                                            he cried out involuntarily: “Oh no! Could it be them?”</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a charming yet annoyed voice rang out from outside:
                                            “Get out of my way, or don’t blame me if I take you down.”</p>
                                        <p>“Fei’er!” Zhou Weiqing no longer had time to care about Shen Ji, rushing out
                                            of the tent immediately, only to see Shangguan Fei’er trying to force her
                                            way in but being blocked by a group of Shen Ji’s personal guards. By now,
                                            she had already knocked out a few of them, and was making her way towards
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Fei’er immediately cried out urgently: “Little
                                            Fatty, things aren’t good. Ma Qun and Crow’s Tribes have reached our
                                            previous Peerless Battalion camp site to look for us, and they met the two
                                            vanguard Regiments of the WanShou Empire armies. Both sides have already
                                            started fighting. We just received word of this… quick, think of
                                            something.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s guess had indeed been proven right, but he was definitely not
                                            happy about it as he furrowed his brow. This was two Regiments after all,
                                            and it was not a battleground they had prepared like in their previous
                                            fight, nor could they fight and retreat at the same time as in the previous
                                            case if they wanted to rescue the two tribes. Fighting to the end was the
                                            only choice if they wanted to rescue the two tribes. However, even
                                            dismissing the possibility of WanShou Empire reinforcement, just finishing
                                            off two entire WanShou Empire Regiments was definitely not an easy task.</p>
                                        <p>After a brief moment of thought, a resolute look crossed Zhou Weiqing’s face.
                                            At the same time, Shen Ji had come out from the tent, motioning his personal
                                            guards to retreat before heading up to ask: “Battalion Commander Zhou, what
                                            is wrong?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing replied solemnly: “The unknown forces being surrounded by the
                                            WanShou Empire forces you were speaking of in the report are my Peerless
                                            Battalion men. Legion Commander Shen Ji, can you please lend me five
                                            thousand war horses?”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s keen gaze, Shen Ji couldn’t help but feel
                                            surprised. <i>Peerless Battalion men? Those unknown outside forces belonged
                                                to the Peerless Battalion? Driving carts? What was going on? </i>Even
                                            more so, Zhou Weiqing was only borrowing war horses from him, not troops to
                                            make the rescue.</p>
                                        <p>“Things are extremely urgent, legion Commander Shen Ji.” Zhou Weiqing
                                            prompted once more urgently.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, he had realised that it was truly impossible to not have
                                            warhorses. Even though his target for the Peerless Battalion soldiers was to
                                            gear them with Consolidated Wings, with their cultivation level, it was
                                            impossible for them to fly for long periods of time, even if all of them
                                            were equipped with it now. It looks like they would have to take care of
                                            this neglect and start to prepare warhorses for the entire Peerless
                                            Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji furrowed his brow tightly and said: “Battalion Commander Zhou, it is
                                            no small matter to mobilize five thousand warhorses. Even for myself, I have
                                            to get permission from above.”</p>
                                        <p>“Don’t you know, saving lives is like putting out a fire, urgency is of the
                                            utmost importance! What asking for permission bullshit. Let’s go.” Zhou
                                            Weiqing was extremely furious, pulling Shangguan Fei’er and turning to leave
                                            instantly, Wei Feng following closely behind as they rushed towards the
                                            Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>The surrounding personal guards of Shen Ji couldn’t help but stare in shock,
                                            their eyes wide open. <i>What kind of Battalion Commander was this? He even
                                                dared to scold the Legion Commander like that?</i></p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji was also angered by Zhou Weiqing’s scolding, but he was after all a
                                            wise commander of an entire Legion, and he quickly calmed himself down. He
                                            immediately called for his warhorse, personally heading to the Northwest
                                            Army Headquarters to report the situation.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, as the three rushed towards the Peerless Battalion, Zhou
                                            Weiqing asked Wei Feng: “Old Wei, how many warhorses do we have?”</p>
                                        <p>The entire internal affairs of the Peerless Battalion was handled by Wei
                                            Feng, and without hesitation he replied: “We have eighteen Ghost Demon
                                            Horses and around six hundred ordinary warhorses.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing those words, Zhou Weiqing was given a pleasant surprise: “So
                                            many?”</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng replied: “Originally, we managed to get over a hundred warhorses
                                            from the Sixteenth Regiment. Furthermore, after that, several times when
                                            Senior Mu En and Luo Ke Di went to requisition resources from the
                                            quartermaster, they managed to get warhorses a few times.</p>
                                        <p>A few times? That was nearly five hundred more warhorses! The Scoundrel Rogue
                                            pair of the Heavenly Bow Unit truly lived up to their name!</p>
                                        <p>“That’s great. When we return, immediately give the orders to prepare to move
                                            out. Of all the Main Companies, I want all Main Company Leaders, Ordinary
                                            Company Leaders, Vice Company Leaders, all officers to gather. All the
                                            Peerless Battalion soldiers with Consolidated Equipment Wings are also to
                                            gear up fully, with sufficient arrows and javelins, before gathering. We
                                            will be leaving as soon as they gear up. Big Bro Wei, I will personally lead
                                            them as a speedy vanguard, and I want you to lead the rest of them men to
                                            back us up as quickly as possible.”</p>
                                        <p>In order to rush to the rescue of the Gold Crow Tribe and the Berserker
                                            Tribe, Zhou Weiqing could no longer sit and make a perfect plan with all
                                            details mapped out. Although he had wanted to train his newly replenished
                                            and equipped Peerless Battalion with a fight against the WanShou Empire
                                            armies, he had not expected the fight to come so soon and so urgently.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng quickly agreed.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as they returned to the Peerless Battalion, the orders were
                                            immediately passed down. The speed of gathering was extremely impressive,
                                            and it was barely fifteen minutes before all the warriors Zhou Weiqing had
                                            requested for were gathered.</p>
                                        <p>After such a long period of training, these Ruffian soldiers were after all
                                            eager to fight, and by this time they were eager to test the fruits of their
                                            training. The older soldiers had already told the newer ones about how their
                                            Peerless Battalion’s fighting was always aimed at having zero losses. This
                                            was a great chance for them to make a fortune! This was especially true now,
                                            as before entering the battle times, the Northwest Armies had already made
                                            the announcement that once the battle started, a single Beastman soldier
                                            head was worth ten gold in bounty!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood in the central open space of the Peerless Battalion camp
                                            awaiting his men to gather.</p>
                                        <p>When he had first received news, he only had worry and urgency in his heart.
                                            However, by now, he had calmed down. His character had always been rather
                                            emotional, but he would never lose sight of logic due to emotions. This was
                                            also why one of his first plans had been to create the Peerless Battalion
                                            Air Force, to eventually gear all his soldiers with the Consolidated Wings.
                                            As soon as they met with powerful enemies beyond their power, at least he
                                            had the confidence they would be able to retreat safely.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander.” Wei Feng quickly walked up to him and gave him a
                                            salute. “Reporting, the First Main Company is fully gathered, all five
                                            hundred of the Air Force troops. Please give the orders.”</p>
                                        <p>Although the officers had tried to divide the troops so that all the Main
                                            Companies had a relatively equal strength, but after some discussion, they
                                            still decided to concentrate the Air Force into the First Main Company, at
                                            least for the time being. This would allow them to be better directed in a
                                            fight.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Everyone mount up, get ready to move out.”</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng replied: “Yes Sir.” However, he did not pass down the orders
                                            immediately, instead lowering his voice and asking: “Do you want to bring
                                            the Special Forces unit along as well?” The Special Forces unit was totally
                                            made out of the Heavenly Jewel Masters and Elemental Jewel Masters, mostly
                                            Elemental Jewels, and was under the personal control of Hua Feng and the
                                            other Heavenly Bow Unit archers, currently number slightly over two hundred
                                            men.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “No need, you bring them along with the
                                            main forces to back us up. I estimate that you can set an ambush about a
                                            hundred li from where the current battle is. Do not advance too far out, but
                                            also not too little. You will need to move out as fast as possible after
                                            us.”</p>
                                        <p>If they advanced too far, it would put them at risk of being surrounded and
                                            taken down by their enemies. However, if they were not far out enough, and
                                            too close to the Northwest Armies encampment, the enemies might not chase
                                            them as well. It was a tricky balance indeed.</p>
                                        <p>After giving the simple instructions to Wei Feng, Zhou Weiqing mounted his
                                            own Single-Horned Ghost Demon Horse. The rest of the Peerless Battalion
                                            powerhouses and the First Main Company also mounted their horses and they
                                            galloped out of the camp towards the northern border.</p>
                                        <p>This time, it could be said that all the top forces of the Peerless Battalion
                                            had followed Zhou Weiqing out. Shangguan Fei’er, Lin TianAo, the seven God
                                            Archers of the Heavenly Bow Unit, as well as all the Main Company Leaders,
                                            Company Leaders and other officers. The only officers he did not bring along
                                            were the Squad Leaders, and the only reason for that was because he was
                                            afraid Wei Feng might have trouble controlling the entire army if he did so.
                                            The current Peerless Battalion had five Main Companies and a special forces
                                            unit, thus numbering six Main Company Leaders and twenty seven Company
                                            Leaders. These officers were generally at least six-Jeweled Physical Jewel
                                            Masters or higher, with some Heavenly Jewel Masters like Lei Zi. It could be
                                            said that these were the absolute pillars of the entire Peerless Battalion.
                                            Including the most elite forces of the First Main Company, the five hundred
                                            men whose combat abilities could be said to be at least a third of the
                                            entire Peerless Battalion’s power.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not disturb his teacher who was cultivation in his tent. Let
                                            alone the fact that Long Shiya had already made it clear previously that he
                                            would not join in such fights, he would find it embarrassing to have to ask
                                            his teacher for help in this matter.</p>
                                        <p>From the time that the Peerless Battalion scouts had sent word back, to the
                                            time that Zhou Weiqing led his men out, it had barely taken an hour. About
                                            fifteen minutes after the five hundred elite had left, the rest of the
                                            entire Peerless Battalion started moving out under Wei Feng’s command,
                                            heading steadily towards the north. The daily strict movement and training
                                            came into absolute great use here, as the men gathered quickly and in neat
                                            formations, almost incomparable to the other Regiments of the Seventh
                                            Legion. It could be said that the Peerless Battalion had already grown to be
                                            the strongest troop in the entire Northwest Armies!</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>At the Seventh legion, Shen Ji rushed back to his own headquarters and
                                            quickly sent ordesr down for all the Light and Heavy Cavalry troops within
                                            his Legion to gather, and prepare for battle.</p>
                                        <p>When he had reported the news to the Northwest Headquarters, he had been
                                            given a scolding by his Master and Godfather. That had been such a great
                                            opportunity to grant a favour to the Peerless Battalion and get back on
                                            their good side, and he had not seized it immediately. The WanShou Empire
                                            armies had not fully attacked yet, and this was merely a probing attack.
                                            Furthermore, who knew who those people were that Zhou Weiqing had mentioned?
                                            What if they came from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace?</p>
                                        <p>As such, as soon as Shen Ji returned to his Legion, he quickly sent orders
                                            for his Cavalry troops to assemble.</p>
                                        <p>The Seventh Legion’s troops were well geared, and they had about ten thousand
                                            Light Cavalry Troops, and there were also four Battalions of Heavy Cavalry,
                                            and the total cavalry troops numbered fourteen thousand men, at least thirty
                                            percent more than most Legions.</p>
                                        <p>Besides the Seventh Legion, the Northwest Army Command also dispatched Five
                                            Regiments from the Eighth Legion to the front lines as backup. However, by
                                            the time the Seventh Legion’s Cavalry gathered and started moving out, the
                                            infantry of the Peerless Battalion had already moved out for more than two
                                            hours.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing and his vanguard continued galloping, he continued receiving
                                            reports from the frontline scouts.</p>
                                        <p>The Gold Crow tribe and the Berserker Tribe had truly come at a bad time.
                                            Although the two Tribes were not large tribes, added together they still
                                            numbered more than ten thousand. They had streamed in from the Fei Li Empire
                                            through the border between the WanShou and ZhongTian Empires, with nearly a
                                            thousand horse carts in tow with all their belongings.</p>
                                        <p>When they had arrived at the old camp of the Peerless Battalion, they had
                                            unfortunately met with the two Regiments vanguard of the WanShou Empire.</p>
