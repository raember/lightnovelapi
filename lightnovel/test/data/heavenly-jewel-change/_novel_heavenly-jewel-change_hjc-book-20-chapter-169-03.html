                                            up to his forehead before disappearing. At last, the entire area fell into a
                                            dead silence.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, a powerful ray of Light Attribute Energy suddenly descended
                                            from the skies, pushing Zhou Weiqing to the side and enveloping Little
                                            Witch’s body. At the same time, a long robe floated down, covering her naked
                                            body.</p>
                                        <p>Only then did Long Big Fatty appear from outside the smoke. Naturally, it was
                                            his Light Attribute Healing Skills that fell upon Wu Yuehan, not holding
                                            back as he helped to heal her wounds and renourish her exhausted body. As he
                                            did so, there was a forced smile on his face. Up until now, he still did not
                                            know how he could compensate this young lady in front of him.</p>
                                        <p>With the healing and aid of such powerful Light Attribute Healing Skills, it
                                            wasn’t long before Little Witch opened her eyes. No longer affected by the
                                            strange scent and aura that Zhou Weiqing previously had, she quickly
                                            regained full consciousness and awareness.</p>
                                        <p>The first thing Little Witch felt was the the warm and comfortable Light
                                            Attribute Heavenly Energy enveloping her entire body. As a Life Attribute
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master, the Heavenly Energy Attribute that they liked the
                                            most was definitely the Light Attribute, although the Demonic Attribute in
                                            her body was suppressed by the Light Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>A feeling of heaviness soon followed, as if her limbs had been injected by
                                            lead, and even lifting her arm seemed so difficult. She felt like all the
                                            strength and energy had been drained out of her body.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to the sheer fatigue and weakness in her physical body, her
                                            Heavenly Energy was a stark contrast. Little Witch was astonished to find
                                            that her Heavenly Energy was actually full and bountiful. More so, she had
                                            somehow actually broken through to the seven-Jeweled stage without knowing
                                            when!</p>
                                        <p>Contrary to her expectations, her bottom was not hurting, instead feeling
                                            numb. After all, after an entire day and night, no matter how tough and
                                            flexible her body was, a young maiden like herself with no prior experience
                                            being sent to the peak over and over… it undoubtedly was a huge toll on her
                                            body.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya looked at her with an apologetic expression on his face as he
                                            said: “Little girl, I’m sorry. If i did not do this, my disciple would have
                                            gone crazy and died. At that time, even if it were a female pig, I would
                                            have brought it back for him, but it is your misfortune that I stumbled
                                            across you at that particular time. Do you have any requests? As long as I
                                            can do it, I will fulfil any requests you have.”</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch’s eyes were a little hollow, empty. Even though the entire
                                            ‘sacrifice’ process she did not feel any pain, in fact giving her a
                                            previously unknown, marvelous feeling, but she had lost her most precious
                                            virtue against her will after all! To any girl, this was a blow far worse
                                            than anything, perhaps even more than her own life itself.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya’s mouth twitched slightly as he looked on helplessly. Finally, he
                                            waved his hand, and Zhou Weiqing, who had been lying at the side, was
                                            dragged into his hands. Currently, Zhou Weiqing had lost that purple hue,
                                            and the wings behind his back had disappeared into his body, and he had
                                            finally resumed his normal look and features. Of course, all of his hair
                                            that had been burnt away in the magma could not be regrown so quickly, and
                                            his features did contain some differences from his previous look. At this
                                            moment, his eyes were closed, sleeping peacefully with a satisfied look on
                                            his face.</p>
                                        <p>“How about this, little lady, I have a proposition for you and you can see
                                            whether or not you want to accept it. Anyway, this little brat has already
                                            taken your body, how about you make do with him and marry him. If you want
                                            to take revenge for that one day and night and how roughly he treated you,
                                            you have a lifetime ahead of you to do so.”</p>
                                        <p>Throughout his entire long life, Long Shiya had stood upright on his legs
                                            between heaven and earth, upstanding and dauntless, and though he might do
                                            things according to his own likes and dislikes, he could hold his head up
                                            high and say he had never done anything against his conscience. However,
                                            this time, catching Little Witch as a Sacrifice for Zhou Weiqing, he had
                                            been torn by both anxiety and worry and his conscience. Now that all of it
                                            was over, he felt an unprecedented apologetic feeling towards this young
                                            lady.</p>
                                        <p>Subconsciously, Little Witch raised her head. As she slowly calmed down, she
                                            knew that she could not seek death so easily. After all, the entire Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect only had her as a direct bloodline heir. If she died like that,
                                            who would be able to inherit the Heavenly Demon Sect and help direct it… to
                                            help it grow? Furthermore, she had so many things left undone. She started
                                            to look up, wanting to see this man who had stolen her virtue, to see what
                                            he looked like, and remember that image. Since he had already taken her
                                            body, perhaps what this Heavenly Emperor powerhouse said was true, and it
                                            would not be a bad thing to marry his disciple. Feelings aside, at least it
                                            would bring a strong and powerful Heavenly Emperor ally to the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect.</p>
                                        <p>As she thought about all that, Little Witch’s tears couldn’t help but stream
                                            down her cheeks uncontrollable. However, when she slowly raised her head
                                            once more to look upon that man, and that familiar face entered her eyes, in
                                            that instant, her eyes widened fully.</p>
                                        <p>“What?!” Despite still feeling weak and feeble, Little Witch sat up fully
                                            upright instantly, her eyes filled with disbelief as her lips trembled
                                            violently in sheer shock.</p>
                                        <p>“Errr….” Long Shiya looked at Little Witch, then looked back at his precious
                                            disciple, a helpless look on his face as he said: “As the saying goes, if
                                            one marries a chicken, one should follow the chicken; if one marries a dog,
                                            then one should follow the dog [1. A very awkward direct translation of an
                                            old chinese idiom, basically means to persuade a girl to be content with her
                                            husband no matter what his lot is]. My disciple might not be the most
                                            handsome or suave, but you two already have that connection… so, perhaps you
                                            can make do with him?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Big Fatty had also thought things through rather clearly. Only by
                                            bringing his precious disciple and this little young lady from the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect together could the knot in his heart be eased. Although his
                                            disciple had done wrong to her, but at least if he took responsibility for
                                            it, then he wouldn’t feel as guilty.</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou… Zhou Weiqing?!” Little Witch’s voice was filled with uncertainty. If a
                                            second ago, she had been filled with despair and hopelessness in her future,
                                            with all her negative emotions buried deep within her heart with a mask…
                                            then now, in this very instant, powerful fires of hope sprang forth. She had
                                            never thought that this man who had forcefully stolen her virtue would
                                            actually… actually be … him. If… If she had to be forced to make a choice of
                                            a man in this world, then our dear Zhou Little Fatty would definitely be the
                                            first choice. Currently, Little Witch felt as if the heavens had played a
                                            cruel joke on her… first letting her lose her most precious virtue, turning
                                            everything into a living hell for her, before springing such a strong hope
                                            on her once more, as if the sheer agony she was in wasn’t as bad as she
                                            thought after all.</p>
                                        <p>“Oh?! You… you know him?” This time, it was Long Shiya’s turn to be
                                            surprised.</p>
                                        <p>A ray green light lit up brightly. It was Little Witch, using her Life
                                            Attribute Skills to heal herself, even as she eyed Zhou Weiqing, who was
                                            being supported by Long Shiya… a complicated look on her face as her heart
                                            was mired with a myriad confused thoughts.</p>
                                        <p><i>It was… How could it be him? Since when did he have a Heavenly Emperor
                                            powerhouse as teacher? More so… what was he doing here? How did they all end
                                            up like this? This is too much of a coincidence?! </i>Thinking back to their
                                            entire day and night of embarrassing joining, Little Witch’s pale face
                                            turned beet red instantly. At the same time, she couldn’t help but think to
                                            herself: <i>Thank the heavens… in such a terrible scenario of pain and
                                                suffering, at least this is the best possible outcome already.</i></p>
                                        <p>Slowly supporting herself as she stood up shakily, Little Witch nodded her
                                            head lightly. “Indeed, Senior, I know him. We are actually friends. I…
                                            I....”</p>
                                        <p>Speaking up to this point, Little Witch’s eyes reddened. No matter what, she
                                            had been forced against her will to lose her most precious virtue, and more
                                            so, so abruptly… so out of the blue!</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya started momentarily. “Recognize? You recognize that little brat?
                                            That is great, even better than I thought! What a great coincidence! Heh
                                            heh, then… can I consider it as you being relatively voluntary in helping
                                            out rather than me forcing you? After all, this old man has not done
                                            anything against my conscience all my life, sigh… this time, for that damn
                                            little brat’s sake, I have…” As he said that, he rubbed his hands together,
                                            a rather embarrassed look on his face.</p>
                                        <p>How intelligent was Little Witch. She immediately understood what Long Shiya
                                            meant from his words, and she couldn’t help but look at him scornfully in
                                            her heart momentarily. However, as her consciousness fully awakened and she
                                            knew that the man who had stolen her virtue was actually Zhou Weiqing, she
                                            was now extremely clear-headed.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, what was the point of crying or causing a commotion? The only
                                            true thing to do now was to find a way to gain the most. That fellow Zhou
                                            Weiqing did not just have a single woman!</p>
                                        <p>“Senior…” Wu Yuehan said grievously: “This is too much of a coincidence.
                                            Sigh… yes, I am willing. If I knew it was him beforehand, could I possibly
                                            leave him in the lurch and watch him die?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya was delighted. He had not expected that Wu Yuehan would be so
                                            understanding and considerate. In fact, looking at how she was now, it
                                            seemed like she had some feelings for his precious disciple, and he couldn’t
                                            help but heave an internal sigh of relief, thinking to himself: <i>Such
                                                luck! Heh heh! What a good girl indeed! </i>“Don’t worry, I know about
                                            your circumstance, and you have given your most precious body to this little
                                            brat. If he dares not want you, I will beat him all his skin off! Don’t
                                            worry, I will make sure that this little brat marries you. Oh right, child,
                                            I still do not know your name.”</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch lowered his head and said: “This Junior is Wu Yuehan.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya nodded repeatedly and said: “Very good, in that case, you might as
                                            well not leave. When that little brat wakes up, I’ll make the decision for
                                            you two.”</p>
                                        <p>“No… no need, Senior.” Little Witch quickly looked up, a complicated look in
                                            her eyes as she said: “Senior, I do not want to meet him under such a
                                            circumstance. Please do not force him, after all it was just to save his
                                            life. He originally never liked me. Please can I trouble you to send me
                                            back?”</p>
                                        <p>“What like or dislike. Hmph. He has already taken your body, and you are
                                            willing to let it go like that? Child, do not worry, in this matter, this
                                            old man will settle it for you. You are from the Heavenly Demon Sect right,
                                            later on I will bring that little brat and personally go to your Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect to propose marriage.”</p>
                                        <p>Wu Yuehan was delighted in her heart, looking at Long Shiya with a face full
                                            of hope. “Senior, is that for real?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya thumped his own chest steadily and said: “Since when have I, Long
                                            Shiya, told any lie. However, I must first tell you that this little brat is
                                            a don juan in his own right, and I’m afraid you will not be his only
                                            woman.”</p>
                                        <p>Wu Yuehan gave a bitter smile and said: “How can I not know that? As long as
                                            he still has a place for me in his heart in the future, I will be satisfied.
                                            Senior, can you please send me back now?”</p>
                                        <p>“You still want to leave now?” Long Shiya started momentarily.</p>
                                        <p>Wu Yuehan flushed deeply and said: “I truly do not want to meet him under
                                            such circumstances. I need to calm down and think through things. Senior,
                                            can you please tell me where I can find him in the future?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya sighed. He was not familiar with what had exactly gone on between
                                            Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch before this, and subconsciously he thought it
                                            was this current situation and that the shade in her heart from this
                                            incident was still deep in her mind, and time was needed for her to process
                                            it. As such, he nodded to her and said: “You change your clothes first, and
                                            I will send you back.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
