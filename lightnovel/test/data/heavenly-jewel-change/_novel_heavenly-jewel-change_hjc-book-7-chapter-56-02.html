                                            could win, but now their hearts were rather shaken. After all, Zhou Weiqing
                                            looked unbelievably young for a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master.
                                            His future potential was immeasurable.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of design, as a High Level Consolidating Equipment Master, Yun Li
                                            was naturally quick to complete a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scroll
                                            Design. As for Zhou Weiqing, he also slowed down on purpose, completing his
                                            design a few minutes after Yun Li.</p>
                                        <p>As the two exchanged their designs and examined it closely, both their faces
                                            changed. Zhou Weiqing’s design was naturally rather complicated, but Yun
                                            Li’s design was no simple one either, a huge shield. Zhou Weiqing could
                                            instantly see that it was a shield suited for an Earth Attribute Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master, and only for Heavenly Jewel Masters. It was right at the limit
                                            of Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, just a fine line from being a
                                            High Level Consolidating Equipment Scroll. This Yun Li might seem arrogant
                                            and rash, but he was in truth very cautious. After all, this bet was
                                            regarding his own freedom.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li lifted his head to look at Zhou Weiqing, and Zhou Weiqing did the same
                                            thing. As they looked at each other, Yun Li said solemnly: “Let’s begin
                                            then.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Alright.”</p>
                                        <p>After the simple agreement, both turned around simultaneously, each telling
                                            the respective shopkeepers the required ingredients.</p>
                                        <p>“3 Plumed Feathers from the Red Sword Bird, a Blue Peak Stone, a Waxy Jade, a
                                            gram of diamonds, a Heavenly Core from a Great Earth Monitor Lizard…” Zhou
                                            Weiqing quickly listed out the various items that he needed. “... they need
                                            to be ground together into dust, and also prepare a bowl of Great Earth
                                            Monitor Lizard Blood.”</p>
                                        <p>Qin Feng quickly noted down the materials required, and headed back into the
                                            shop to prepare them. After all, these were just the materials for Mid Level
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, and this was the heart of the Trading
                                            Centre, and they definitely had many materials stocked up.</p>
                                        <p>At the other side, Yun Li had also told Zhou Changxi the materials he
                                            required, and while Zhou Changxi and Qin Feng were busy preparing the
                                            materials, Zhou Weiqing and Yun Li both looked at each other once more.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li said calmly: “Looks like I have underestimated you. Just from the
                                            design alone, I admit that you are truly a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Then do you want to know how old I
                                            am? I don’t mind telling you… I am not even seventeen years old yet. Have
                                            you ever seen a sixteen year old Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master?
                                            If you haven’t, what basis do you have to say that I won’t become a God Tier
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master in the future?” Zhou Weiqing naturally did
                                            not waste the chance to strike at his opponent’s confidence.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li’s face changed slightly, but he continued saying coldly: “It’s still
                                            too early to say anything. We shall know after our bet is concluded.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned, a sly look on his face.</p>
                                        <p>After a short wait, both sides had finally prepared the ingredients for the
                                            Consolidating Ink, and the final preparation of the Ink had to be done by
                                            the respective Consolidating Equipment Masters. This was one of the most
                                            important skills of a Consolidating Equipment Master, not only having to
                                            infuse the Spatial Attribute Heavenly Energy at the right times, and having
                                            the exact right amount to join the mix.</p>
                                        <p>In this aspect, naturally Zhou Weiqing could not compare to Yun Li. After
                                            all, he had more than ten years experience ahead of Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>By the time Yun Li had completed his Consolidating Ink and had started on his
                                            first scroll, Zhou Weiqing was still carefully creating his Consolidating
                                            Ink. Shangguan Bing’er and Qin Feng furrowed their brows in worry. As for
                                            the surrounding audience, all of them remained dead silent, knowing that
                                            under such a circumstance, they should definitely not do anything to disturb
                                            either of the Consolidating Equipment Masters hard at work. Not to mention
                                            the fact it was common courtesy, just the danger of offending a talented
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master was not something that they could afford to
                                            do.</p>
                                        <p>In creating any new set of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, the first sheet
                                            was naturally the most difficult. Seeing that he had completed his
                                            Consolidating Ink way before Zhou Weiqing, Yun Li felt at ease. He did not
                                            try to rush things, and took his time to carefully draw the first
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scroll. He wanted to put stability as his priority,
                                            at least for the first one, and once he got used to it, he could pick up his
                                            speed.</p>
                                        <p>According to his estimate, to complete such a set of Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls would take him about eight hours. This was already the limit that a
                                            High Level Consolidating Equipment Master like him could reach, and in
                                            expending such energy and effort in doing so at such high speeds, he would
                                            have to rest at least half a month to fully recover to his peak.</p>
                                        <p>After all, creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls took a toll on the
                                            spirit, otherwise Huyan Aobo would not be just creating 2-3 sets per
                                            year.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was the only exception to this. To him, as long as he had
                                            completed a Consolidating Equipment Scroll once, from the second onwards it
                                            was a robotic process. With his Time Attribute’s fine control, he did not
                                            need to put his full concentration, that was the reason why he could churn
                                            them out at such speeds. Unless another person had to two great attributes
                                            like him, Time and Spatial, only then would they be able to duplicate his
                                            process. Yet, the Time Attribute was one of the rarest attributes, and how
                                            could Yun Li possibly guess that he had it.</p>
                                        <p>Soon, an hour had passed. By then, Yun Li had already spent much time just
                                            drawing the scroll, and Zhou Weiqing had just managed to finish creating the
                                            Consolidating Ink.</p>
                                        <p>Just like Yun Li’s focus on stability, Zhou Weiqing was the same. However,
                                            his stability was focused on creating his Consolidating Ink; after all, as
                                            long as he did not have any errors with his Consolidating Ink, how could
                                            anyone compare in speed to his creating of Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls?</p>
                                        <p>Besides Qin Feng and Shangguan Bing’er who were worried for Zhou Weiqing, and
                                            Zhou Changxi on the other side who was full of glee, all the other audience
                                            members were just watching happily, glad to widen their horizons. After all,
                                            it was a rare chance to be able to just watch a Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master at work, let alone two! As such, no one was willing to leave, and as
                                            more people gathered to watch, a huge crowd was soon present.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing soon started on his first scroll, while Yun Li was already more
                                            than halfway through his first. It had to be said that Yun Li was indeed
                                            very talented in creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, with nary a sign
                                            of making a mistake despite it being his first time. His hands were stable
                                            and firm, unwavering and calm. It seemed that it would not be long before he
                                            completed his first scroll. He truly befitted his reputation in the Fei Li
                                            City.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not have the time to watch his opponent. After all, creating
                                            the first scroll was something just as important to him. Taking a deep
                                            breath, his twelve energy whirlpools at his opened Death Acupuncture Points
                                            whirling at top speed, frantically drawing in energy from the atmosphere, as
                                            his attribute wheel moved to the silver area, and a dim silver light dimly
                                            encircled the tip of his Consolidating Brush. Dipping it slightly into his
                                            Consolidating Ink, he started on drawing on the first scroll.</p>
                                        <p>When creating the first scroll, despite having the Wind and Time Attribute to
                                            aid him, Zhou Weiqing was no faster than Yun Li. This was the difference in
                                            experience between a Mid Level and High Level Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master.</p>
                                        <p>Another hour passed...</p>
                                        <p>A gold flash filled the area, and Yun Li let loose a breath. His first Scroll
                                            was finally complete.</p>
                                        <p>Due to the pressure from the bet, Yun Li felt like this was the first time he
                                            had concentrated so hard, and gone so fast in creating a new Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scroll. He felt that he had improved. He mused to himself that he
                                            was yet another step closer to reaching the status of Grandmaster, wondering
                                            if he could do so before the age of thirty-five. If he managed to do so, he
                                            might even have the chance to attempt to break through to the Zong Stage
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master before the age of fifty, which would even
                                            give him the chance to attempt at reaching God Tier!</p>
                                        <p>He took a quick glance at Zhou Weiqing. Being very experienced with the
                                            design that he had given Zhou Weiqing, he naturally could tell with a glance
                                            that Zhou Weiqing was only a third into the scroll.</p>
                                        <p>Filled with a fresh burst of confidence, Yun Li was confident he had the win
                                            in his grasp. In his happiness, he did not even stop to rest, starting
                                            immediately on his second scroll. There was an obvious increase in speed
                                            when he did so, as his brush swiftly swept across the scroll, silver light
                                            flashing. In a matter of minutes, his second scroll was complete.</p>
                                        <p>In creating a set of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, he naturally grew
                                            faster as he gained more experienced. Another hour passed, and Yun Li had
                                            just finished his sixteenth scroll, while Zhou Weiqing had only just
                                            finished his first scroll.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, everyone, even Shangguan Bing’er and Qin Feng, were sure that
                                            Zhou Weiqing had lost. After all, Shangguan Bing’er had never personally
                                            seen him creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>Lifting his head, Zhou Weiqing let loose a breath of relief. Looking at Yun
                                            Li, he was also rather surprised, thinking to himself - <i>That guy is
                                                really something, being able to make almost twenty scrolls in such a
                                                short time!</i> Turning his head, he saw Shangguan Bing’er with a
                                            concerned, almost despairing look on her face. He flashed her a sneaky grin,
                                            before turning to his second scroll.</p>
                                        <p>With a thought, under the cover of his sleeve, the three Elemental Jewels of
                                            his lit up. Of course, with the Ring of Concealment’s effect, their glow was
                                            changed to that of the Spatial Gold-Green Cat’s Eye.</p>
                                        <p>In Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, three superimposed attribute wheels appeared, resting
                                            in the green, silver and colourless areas respectively. Amongst his six
                                            attributes, his Wind, Spatial and Time Attributes were activated. Without
                                            question, this took up much Heavenly Energy, but with his Immortal Deity
                                            Technique regenerating at max speed, he had no issues supporting himself for
                                            the next two hours. With a quick dip of his brush, he refilled it with
                                            Consolidating Ink, and as the entire process of creating the first scroll
                                            flashed through in his mind, in the next instant, his entire body seemed to
                                            become a robot as it moved swiftly.</p>
                                        <p>His right hand moved quickly, under the increased speed of the Wind
                                            Attribute, the control of the Time Attribute, it was as if his brush came to
                                            life, moving like lightning. Within ten breaths, a gold light flashed, and
                                            his second Consolidating Equipment Scroll was complete.</p>
                                        <p></p>
