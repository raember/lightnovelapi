                                            also in dire straits. To be able to unleash a skill that not only took out
                                            Shen Little Demon’s final blow, but also take her down, how could his
                                            current body possibly withstand such an immense power?</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo and the others did not even have time to be excited about their
                                            win. The only thing in their minds now was whether or not Zhou Weiqing was
                                            alright.</p>
                                        <p>As the members of both sides jumped onto stage, all of a sudden, a terrifying
                                            aura came pressing down onto the entire stage. Instantly, the members in mid
                                            air were suddenly forced down onto the ground, unable to move, or even
                                            breathe.</p>
                                        <p>No one knew when or how, but abruptly there was a man standing on the
                                            stage.</p>
                                        <p>Simple features, deep piercing eyes, and that immense and powerful aura. This
                                            man was the one who had been hiding in the shadows for the entire fight,
                                            Shangguan Longyin.</p>
                                        <p>Both sides, suppressed onto the ground, looked at Shangguan Longyin in
                                            confusion. No matter the Fei Li Battle Team or the Dan Dun Battle Team, none
                                            of them could understand why the overall main judge would appear on the
                                            stage at this time.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin swept his gaze across their faces, before finally recalling
                                            his aura.</p>
                                        <p>“Calm down, both sides. The two of them will not die so easily. As the main
                                            judge, I need to verify something to ensure the sanctity and fairness of
                                            this Tournament.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he lifted his hand towards Zhou Weiqing, whose body was
                                            immediately brought towards him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was still conscious, but he was unable to make any movement, and
                                            could only watch as his body floated towards Shangguan Longyin.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Shangguan Longyin’s words, the faces of the Fei Li Battle Team
                                            changed. Only then did they remember that Zhou Weiqing had just unleashed
                                            the Demonic Change… the taboo of the entire mainland!</p>
                                        <p>Since the Fei Li Battle Team understood so quickly, naturally the Dan Dun
                                            Battle Team understood as well, their vexed faces turning slightly better.
                                            They were all eagerly waiting for Shangguan Longyin to announce that Zhou
                                            Weiqing was a heretic from the Heavenly Demon Sect, and the best case
                                            scenario would be that he would be put to death immediately, to assuage
                                            their anger and hate. How could their Leader possibly lose to such a mere
                                            fellow of three-Jeweled cultivation level… this was definitely a terrible
                                            insult and humiliation to not just the Blood Red Hell, but also the entire
                                            Dan Dun Empire.</p>
                                        <p>As for Little Witch, who was standing at the entrance of the Kalise Battle
                                            Team Rest House, a look of relief crossed her face. Only she truly
                                            understood what Shangguan Longyin was doing, and what the result would
                                            be.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s body was drawn directly in front of Shangguan Longyin, and he
                                            felt as if the entire air around him was sealed and congealed, causing him
                                            to stand there stiffly without falling through no effort of his own. He did
                                            not feel particularly weak, just totally numb, as if his own body did not
                                            belong to him.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin pressed his right hand onto Zhou Weiqing’s forehead, his
                                            palm shining with a crystalline white; it was the mark of the Heavenly Dao
                                            Energy, the final stage of the four great stages of Heavenly Energy. Without
                                            question, this Shangguan Longyin was at least of the Heavenly King Stage or
                                            higher.</p>
                                        <p>In an instance, the white light enveloped Zhou Weiqing’s entire body.
                                            Currently, not only the members of the Fei Li Battle Team were watching
                                            anxiously, even the ZhongTian Emperor sitting at the VIP Stage, Shangguan
                                            Tianxin, as well as his niece Shangguan Xue’er beside him, were equally
                                            nervous.</p>
                                        <p>Although Shangguan Bing’er had told them he did not have links with the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect, but he could after all control his own Demonic Change.
                                            If Shangguan Longyin discovered that he was truly controlled by the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect, then all their previous plans would be moot, and there would be
                                            no discussion of him marrying into the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianxin knew that this clansman of his had been impressed by this
                                            youth in front of him, and truly cherished such a great talent; at the same
                                            time, a killing intent was sparked in his heart. If Zhou Weiqing was from
                                            the Heavenly Demon Sect, he would not hesitate to finish him off. They could
                                            not risk having someone from the Heavenly Demon Sect infiltrate their
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace by marrying Shangguan Bing’er, that could possibly
                                            cause the downfall of their Great Saint Land.</p>
                                        <p>On the other hand, if Shangguan Longyin could prove that Zhou Weiqing was a
                                            member of the Heavenly Demon Sect, he would definitely do everything in his
                                            power to protect this youth. Zhou Weiqing’s talent and genius was visible to
                                            everyone present, almost to a terrifying level. If such a young man grew up
                                            to be their enemy, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace would not be able to sleep in
                                            peace! As such, this was a critical moment even for a Great Saint Lands like
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>Several minutes passed, before Shangguan Longyin finally withdrew his right
                                            palm. His tightened face relaxed, and he glanced towards the VIP Stage,
                                            nodding imperceptibly towards Shangguan Tianxin.</p>
                                        <p>On his seat, Shangguan Tianxin sat back deeper into his seat, sighing in
                                            relief as a faint smile crossed his lips. Since Shangguan Longyin did not
                                            find any sign of seals or curses of the Heavenly Demon Sect in Zhou Weiqing,
                                            that meant that he was truly not of the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p>
                                        <p>He was not suspicious that this was some cunning plan of subterfuge by the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect. After all, with such an outstanding talent like Zhou
                                            Weiqing, if the Heavenly Demon Sect actually got their claws in him, how
                                            could they not possibly want to control him? Why would they risk revealing
                                            him at this point?</p>
                                        <p>If Zhou Weiqing was not of the Heavenly Demon Sect, that meant it was truly
                                            an amazing news for the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. With his six Attributes,
                                            and the ability to control the Demonic Change… in a few dozen years… heh
                                            heh… perhaps the Heavenly Snow Mountain’s slight advantage over the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace would no longer exist.</p>
                                        <p>As he thought up to this point, Shangguan Tianxin was put in a very good
                                            mood. Although Zhou Weiqing was currently not part of the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace, they were definitely in the advantage. After all, he was Shangguan
                                            Bing’er’s man! <i>Looks like I’ll have to have a good chat with Second
                                                Brother.</i></p>
                                        <p>Of course, back on the tournament stage, Zhou Weiqing did not know all the
                                            various repercussions his actions had brought about. Currently, he was
                                            feeling rather out of sorts, almost vexed. Being treated like a lab rat by
                                            Shangguan Longyin, how could he possibly be happy?</p>
                                        <p>He thought to himself. <i>Dammit, when your Father, I, reach the Heavenly
                                            King Stage in the future, I’ll also play around with others like that. Hmph
                                            Hmph Hmph!</i></p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin looked towards the Dan Dun Battle Team, saying solemnly:
                                            “As the head judge, I have examined him closely. This Zhou Weiqing does not
                                            have the seal of the Heavenly Demon Sect, and the Demonic Change he used is
                                            a controlled Demonic Change. As such, he is not considered a heretic. The
                                            previous fight will still be counted, and the results remain unchanged. As
                                            the official judge, I proclaim, the final round of the preliminary heats,
                                            Third Group Fei Li Battle Team is the victor.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he waved his hands, and Zhou Weiqing’s body floated back
                                            down to land amongst Lin TianAo and the other team members. Shangguan
                                            Longyin continued, his voice softening a few notches: “He is totally
                                            exhausted, almost to the point of exhausting his life force, and he will
                                            need a lot to rest to recuperate. I’m afraid that he will not be able to
                                            fight in at least the next round. However, for you all to be able to beat a
                                            seeded team in the preliminary heats, you have already made history.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, Shangguan Longyin waved his hand again; this time Shen
                                            Little Demon was brought in front of him. Although in his heart he was on
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s side, he had to go through the motions to help both sides;
                                            after all, the Blood Red Hell was also a Great Saint Lands.</p>
                                        <p>As she was brought in front of him, Shangguan Longyin placed a hand on her
                                            wrist and extended his senses. Moments later, his face changed; even with
                                            his cultivation level, he couldn’t help but reveal a shocked expression,
                                            glancing involuntarily to Zhou Weiqing, who was currently being carted away
                                            by Lin TianAo and the other Fei Li Battle Team members.</p>
                                        <p>After a short pause, Shangguan Longyin said: “Let the tournament continue,”
                                            before jumping off the stage with Shen Little Demon, leading the rest of the
                                            Dan Dun Battle Team members towards their Rest House.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Back in the Fei Li Battle Team Rest House.</p>
                                        <p>The team members carried Zhou Weiqing back to the Rest House, before staring
                                            at each other haplessly.</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao muttered: “Is… is this real?! We actually defeated the Dan Dun
                                            Battle Team? Crow, give me a slap, I want to know if it hurts or not.”</p>
                                        <p>“Good! I love requests like this.” Crow lifted up her hand.</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao realised his foolishness at the last moment. “Wait! No! Don’t!
                                            Not you… Xiao Yan, you do it.”</p>
                                        <p>Xiao Yan glared at him exasperatedly and gave him a solid kick in the
                                            buttocks. “You useless bum!”</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao stumbled forward from the kick, and twisting his neck back to
                                            look at the foot imprint on his pants, he blinked and said: “Damn, it really
                                            hurt. Looks like this isn’t a dream! We… we really won!”</p>
                                        <p>In truth, he was not the only one. Every member of the Fei Li Battle Team
                                            still had the feeling like this was not real, like the entire day was a
                                            dream. After staring at each other for a moment, their gazes finally rested
                                            upon Zhou Weiqing, and their expressions turned strange.</p>
                                        <p>For Zhou Weiqing to be able to beat Shen Little Demon, he did not only shock
                                            all the outsiders, but even their entire team was shocked as well. Three
                                            Jewels versus Six Jewels, Upper Level Shi Heavenly Jewel Master against a
                                            Upper Level Zun Heavenly Jewel Master… who would have thought?!</p>
                                        <p>The Fei Li Battle Team had indeed beaten the Dan Dun Battle Team, and even
                                            more so, it had done so by winning the 1v1 against two of their strongest
                                            members. Perhaps it could be argued that Little Four had won entirely by a
                                            stroke of luck, but Zhou Weiqing’s fight was definitely not so. Shen Little
                                            Demon had not been underestimating him, and with her anger, she had
                                            definitely been out to kill. Yet, he had been on the upper hand from the
                                            start of the fight to the finish. Such a victory was indeed an honour, or
                                            perhaps, almost an impossibility. Even if it wasn’t impossible to duplicate
                                            such a feat in the future, it was certainly a feat of history.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was still lying there gasping for breath, his entire body numb
                                            and senseless. He could not even speak, and his expression was ugly.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at him like that, Lin TianAo and the rest were at a loss on how to
                                            help him. They did not dare attempt to use their Heavenly Energy to help
                                            him, as they did not know what was the issue; lest they cause more harm than
                                            good.</p>
                                        <p>Luckily, Shangguan Longyin had said that Zhou Weiqing was only overly
                                            exhausted, and there should be no threat to his life.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a soft, almost shy, voice sounded out: “Big bros and
                                            sis, can I come in please?”</p>
                                        <p>As everyone turned towards the entrance, their jaws dropped as an interesting
                                            look flashed on their faces. This shy voice belonged to that young girl who
                                            had almost killed them all, Little Witch!</p>
                                        <p>Xiao Yan said slowly, his face full of distrust: “Why are you here? We do not
                                            welcome you here.”</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch said, a little aggrievedly: “My intentions are good, I am here
                                            to help him.” As she said that, she pointed a small finger towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>*Swoosh* A white shadow blurred across the room, landing beside Zhou Weiqing.
                                            It was Fat Cat, and its eyes were filled with enmity as it glared at Little
                                            Witch, before roaring lightly at her.</p>
                                        <p></p>
