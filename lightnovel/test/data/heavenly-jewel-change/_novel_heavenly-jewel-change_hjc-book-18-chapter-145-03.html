                                            Overlord Bows. However, typically speaking the most common attribute was the
                                            Strength Attribute, and thus so many of them had the explosive type Overlord
                                            Bow.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not take action personally, instead raising the massive flag
                                            in his hands. As he did so, a wild aura of bloodlust burst forth from him
                                            and he shouted: “Peerless Battalion brothers, before us is the Swift Wolf
                                            Regiment that has raided our homeland countless of times, slain countless of
                                            our comrades, an important unit of the WanShou Empire. Today, the
                                            opportunity has come for you to use your arrows to personally take revenge
                                            for all your countrymen. Everyone, get ready, take aim and listen for my
                                            command!”</p>
                                        <p>One thousand two hundred Consolidated Bows raised up slowly as they stood
                                            shoulder to shoulder, their arms steady, arrows already nocked to their
                                            bowstrings.</p>
                                        <p>The Wolf Cavalry Soldiers were so speedy that as soon as they entered vision,
                                            they wheeled and charged instantly.</p>
                                        <p>An entire Regiment of war wolves charging at top speed… although the sound
                                            was definitely no match for war horses, their speed was much more
                                            terrifying. A sea of black cascaded down towards them in a neat formation,
                                            like a massive dark cloud bank descending from the skies to swallow the
                                            entire Peerless battalion.</p>
                                        <p>In a blink of an eye, the Wolf Cavalry Soldiers had already reached a
                                            distance of  thousand five hundred yards.</p>
                                        <p>At this time, Mu En and Luo Ke Di had kept the food and wine in their hands,
                                            and the seven masters of the Heavenly Bow Unit had all drawn their
                                            respective bows.</p>
                                        <p>“Draw your bows, get ready!” Zhou Weiqing shouted.</p>
                                        <p>Ten breaths. The Wolf Cavalry Soldiers had charged to a thousand yard
                                            distance, and the Peerless Battalion soldiers could already sense the
                                            powerful scent of blood emanating from them.</p>
                                        <p>Row after row of Consolidated Bows, pulled to full crescents, and the thick
                                            reverberation of Heavenly Energy was almost palpable as the entire Peerless
                                            Battalion stood at the ready, and it was as if the very air around them was
                                            twisting and turning subtly.</p>
                                        <p>“Release!” Zhou Weiqing pointed ahead with the massive flag as he shouted in
                                            an explosive voice.</p>
                                        <p>An ear piercing screech, and Zhou Weiqing almost lost his hearing instantly.
                                            One thousand two hundred Overlord Bows rang out at once, the sheer volume of
                                            the screeching sound causing even the charging war wolves in the distance to
                                            be startled.</p>
                                        <p>The effect of releasing one thousand two hundred Overlord Bows at the same
                                            time was totally unexpected. Just the sound of it alone was enough to strike
                                            fear deep into the soul.</p>
                                        <p>One thousand two hundred arrows flew out along with the sound, but the only
                                            thing that could be seen was a wave of shadows.</p>
                                        <p>The absolute maximum range of the Overlord Bow was a thousand two hundred
                                            yards, but in order to ensure accuracy, Zhou Weiqing had waited til the
                                            enemies had passed the one thousand one hundred yard distance before
                                            ordering to fire.</p>
                                        <p>“What is that sound?” At the release of the bows, Regiment Commander Butler
                                            was given a shock. Although they were still relatively far from their
                                            enemies, sound travelled quickly especially across the empty plains, and
                                            such a powerful shrill screech caused him to feel a strong sense of
                                            unease.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a series of violent explosions mixed with shouts and
                                            screams of pain, along with the thudding sound of arrow impacting into flash
                                            abruptly rang forth.</p>
                                        <p>The front row of the charging wolf cavalry soldiers had never expected that
                                            they would meet with such powerful attacks at such a range. Although they
                                            were still more than a thousand yards away from their enemies, as these
                                            arrows filled with piercing or exploding effects reached them, most of the
                                            wolf cavalry soldiers were not able to dodge or block them.</p>
                                        <p>It had all happened too quickly.</p>
                                        <p>The wolf cavalry soldiers were mostly geared in fine leather armour, but how
                                            could their leather armour possibly guard them from the titanium alloy
                                            arrows!</p>
                                        <p>The Overlord Bows of the Peerless Battalion soldiers were not as high quality
                                            as Zhou Weiqing’s Overlord Bow, not only did they not have any sockets, the
                                            explosive or piercing effect they held was no match for Zhou Weiqing’s one
                                            as well. Even so, it was more than sufficient against these ordinary Wolf
                                            Cavalry Soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>Along with the series of explosions, the entire front row of the Wolf Cavalry
                                            soldiers felled like wheat being harvested. Just from this round of
                                            shooting, at least three hundred Wolf Cavalry soldiers had been killed, even
                                            their war wolves had not escaped the fate. This was also because many of the
                                            arrows had struck those in front, sparing those behind. There were also some
                                            of the Peerless Battalion soldiers who were too nervous from being in such a
                                            massive battle for the first time, and had lost accuracy or range.</p>
                                        <p>The first salvo had been launched, and Zhou Weiqing remained impassive as he
                                            planted the flag solidly into the ground. At the same time, he passed the
                                            command to Hua Feng.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng shouted out loud: “Second Ladder Formation, fire. Begin.”</p>
                                        <p>The Ladder Formation type of shooting was a specialised shooting style that
                                            was developed to accompany the Reverse Triangle Formation that the eight
                                            Companies were in. They would begin shooting as hundred men units, starting
                                            from the center spreading to the sides, forming a continuous rain of
                                            arrows.</p>
                                        <p>A large portion of the Peerless Battalion soldiers’ training was to shoot
                                            arrows, and after seeing the effect of the first salvo of arrows, all their
                                            excitement had been sparked. Drawing their bows once more, arrows flew out
                                            accompanied by their shrill cries, as if swarms of locusts descending down
                                            upon the Swift Wolf Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>“Quick, change formation, charge at maximum speed!” Butler howled in rage. He
                                            could not in his wildest dreams imagined that he would lose so many
                                            tribesmen just at the first meeting with this enemy.</p>
                                        <p><i>How was this possible?! How could this be?! They are still so far away,
                                            what kind of bow can have such a terrifying range and power? </i></p>
                                        <p>At this point, their distance was even closer than before, and Butler could
                                            clearly see the Peerless Battalion soldiers. In the glow of the sunlight,
                                            the titanium alloy mail shone with a resplendent gleam, and yet in the midst
                                            of that beautiful bright lights, the shrill cries of the arrows being
                                            released was like a death knell sounding.</p>
                                        <p>It was only by the time the second salvo was released that the Swift Wolf
                                            Regiment finally reformed their formation successfully. Due to their large
                                            numbers, they were unable to move in a single straight row. However, they
                                            were all experienced fighters, and under the leadership of Butler, they
                                            quickly made the right choice.</p>
                                        <p>The entire Swift Wolf Regiment had ten Battalions, and the Battalion
                                            Commanders, Vice Battalion Commanders and Company Leaders all charged to the
                                            very front. All the Wolf Cavalry Soldiers charged in a single file behind
                                            their respective leaders, shouting out their chieftain’s name, also the
                                            incantation that would invoke their bloodline powers: “Butler! Butler!
                                            Butler!”</p>
                                        <p>The power of the Wolf Cavalry Soldiers and their War Wolf mounts exploded
                                            forth in that moment, as all the officers were in a row, waving their sabres
                                            in their hands as they charged forward in the lead.</p>
                                        <p>The valiant ferocity of the members of the WanShou Empire showed itself
                                            clearly now; as the Regiment Commander, Butler also charged forward right in
                                            front and center of the entire Regiment, urging his gold war wolf mount as
                                            quickly as possibly in a crazed charge towards the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>In the WanShou Empire, in order to become an officer, one had to be a
                                            powerhouse. All their Company Leaders were all Heavenly Jewel Masters,
                                            though most of them did not have many Consolidated Equipment. At the
                                            Battalion Commander level, they were at least Heavenly Jewel Masters of the
                                            fourth or fifth Jewel stage, with about one or two Consolidated Equipment at
                                            most.</p>
                                        <p>With all of them charging in that formation, it was difficult for even the
                                            arrows from Consolidated Bows to hurt them. As such, the majority of the
                                            third salvo of arrows from the Peerless Battalion was blocked.</p>
                                        <p>A cold smile crossed Hua Feng’s lips. <i>This method again? They already used
                                            that the last time. </i></p>
                                        <p>“Everyone, angle upwards thirty degrees. Projectile motion shooting. Ready,
                                            shoot!”</p>
                                        <p>With the change in orders, all the Peerless Battalion soldiers swapped to
                                            projectile shooting, their arrows arcing into the air in a perfect parabolic
                                            curve, crossing the powerhouses of the Swift Wolf Regiment in the front, and
                                            landing accurately on the Wolf Cavalry soldiers behind.</p>
                                        <p>The Consolidated arrows were extremely powerful and destructive, and just
                                            after a few rounds of shooting, the Swift Wolf Regiment had lost another
                                            thousand men.</p>
                                        <p>Butler’s heart was bleeding. He now understood why the three Companies he had
                                            dispatched out previously had disappeared without a trace. As a Upper Level
                                            Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, how could he not see that those arrows
                                            were filled with Heavenly Energy, most likely even fired from a Consolidated
                                            Weapon. Yet, in his memory, the ZhongTian Empire had never had such a army
                                            unit like that. What kind of power did those bows have?! That was a thousand
                                            yard distance, what kind of bow had that kind of range and power? Even up to
                                            now, he had not realised that all thousand over soldiers of the Peerless
                                            Battalion in front of him were Jewel Masters, though he could not be blamed
                                            for that. After all, it was quite inconceivable.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing the horrible screams from the back, Butler was bursting to charge
                                            deep into the Peerless Battalion formation to slaughter them all. However,
                                            he was after all still mortal, not a god. Even though he had a Upper Level
                                            Zong Stage cultivation level, he was still eight hundred yards from the
                                            Peerless Battalion, and he could not do anything.</p>
                                        <p>No matter how fast the Wolf Cavalry Soldiers were, they could not just charge
                                            a hundred yards as their enemies shot a salvo. With their current speed, by
                                            the time they could reach them, the Peerless Battalion would at least have
                                            the chance to shoot more than twenty rounds.</p>
                                        <p>Although the ordinary Peerless Battalion soldiers were far from being god
                                            tier archers, this half year of tough training under top classed teachers
                                            had given them all a decent accuracy. Furthermore, as their enemies came
                                            closer and closer, so did their accuracy improve.</p>
                                        <p>“Fire Arrows. Get ready!” Hua Feng shouted out loud.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst all the newly Awakened Jewel Masters, it was without a doubt that
                                            there were far fewer Elemental Jewels Masters than Physical Jewel Masters.
                                            Even so, with the aid of the precious medicines, over a thousand Jewel
                                            Masters had Awakened their Personal Power Jewels, and there were over sixty
                                            Elemental Jewel Masters who had Awakened from that. Of them, a majority were
                                            of the Fire Attribute, totally thirty six. Hua Feng had specially taken them
                                            aside out of the usual Companies and assigned them under the Cannon Gao
                                            Shen’s tutelage, and under his direction in combat.</p>
                                        <p>These Elemental Jewel Masters did not have Consolidated Equipment Bows, but
                                            they all had Stored one Skill. The Stored Skill was all the same for them,
                                            just a two-Star Rated Skill, Explosive Fireball. Normally, what they trained
                                            under Gao Shen was how to imbue this Explosive Fireball onto their arrows.
                                            Their arrows were all specially crafted, not only was the tip made of
                                            titanium alloy, even the entire shaft was. Due to their weaker physiques and
                                            lack of a Consolidated Equipment Bow, their range of accuracy was only a two
                                            hundred yard range, but without a doubt in terms of area of effect offensive
                                            power, these thirty six were the greatest weapon in the entire Peerless
                                            battalion.</p>
                                        <p>A merciless smirk crossed Gao Shen’s lips. To be gifted the nickname of
                                            Cannon, an experienced hand like him naturally knew the best time to release
                                            these Fire Arrows. He had been waiting all this time for their time.</p>
