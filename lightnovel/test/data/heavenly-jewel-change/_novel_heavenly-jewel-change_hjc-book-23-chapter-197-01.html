                                            and Shangguan Xue’er flying towards him, it was as if he did not even see
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s ‘Nether State’ body and his various skills in protecting
                                            himself had truly given him a surprise. However, this assassin was extremely
                                            experienced, and he had even seen stranger Skills than the ‘Nether State’.
                                            He was even clearer than Zhou Weiqing how to make use of strength, and he
                                            was sure that with Zhou Weiqing’s six-Jeweled cultivation level, that
                                            strange defensive skill would not be able to last a long time. With his
                                            Darkness Attribute Heavenly Energy surging into this youth, he was confident
                                            he could wipe Zhou Weiqing off the surface of the earth before Shangguan
                                            Xue’er and Tian’er could reach. Furthermore, in the first place, he did not
                                            even care if the two could reach in time. Even for these young ladies, their
                                            highest cultivation level were only seven-Jeweled, what threat could they
                                            pose to him?</p>
                                        <p>This assassin was actually really lucky. His employer did not tell him that
                                            Zhou Weiqing had a Heavenly Emperor stage powerhouse by his side, and more
                                            so, Long Shiya had also left Zhou Weiqing’s side just a few days ago,
                                            thinking there should be no trouble for him. Otherwise, no matter how short
                                            the time was, as long as Long Shiya was nearby, he could easily rush over in
                                            time, and how could the assassin escape then?</p>
                                        <p>Ice cold sensations flooded his entire body, the feeling of his soul being
                                            ripped from him was truly a terrible one. Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense
                                            death encroaching upon him. He knew that once he lost the ‘Nether State’, he
                                            would immediately be destroyed by the black rapier.</p>
                                        <p>His lauded physique and innate defense, facing that black rapier, it was just
                                            like a joke. In the end, cultivation level was cultivation level, and his
                                            level was just not sufficient! If he was also at the Heavenly King Stage,
                                            even if it were just the nine-Jeweled stage, how could that black clad
                                            assassin even hurt him?</p>
                                        <p>All this while, Zhou Weiqing had thought that with all his various boosts,
                                            his many attributes and skills, his strength was still not too bad. However,
                                            at this point, he knew that though those had carried him thus far, the gap
                                            of cultivation level was still his limiting factor in allowing himself to be
                                            an actual powerhouse.</p>
                                        <p>As the black rapier had pierced into Zhou Weiqing, the large net that Touch
                                            of Darkness had formed wrapped down around him, enveloping him totally. With
                                            the difference in cultivation level, it would be very difficult for Zhou
                                            Weiqing to break free of it just by struggling, at least while it lasted.
                                            Furthermore, as that happened, the black clad assassin placed his left palm
                                            on Zhou Weiqing’s head.</p>
                                        <p>Darkness - Nether Seal.</p>
                                        <p>The Darkness Attribute was perhaps best in Sealing Arts, and such a powerful
                                            Seal instantly caused Zhou Weiqing to temporarily lose his ability to use
                                            his Skills. Of course, this Nether Seal was no match for his own Demonic
                                            Dragon God Seal, but it was still able to ‘silence’ him for almost three
                                            seconds, more than enough time.</p>
                                        <p>Three seconds… could his Nether State even last three more seconds? The
                                            Nether State might grant him physical immunity, but it would not grant
                                            immunity of the effects of Stored Skills! The mocking look on the assassin’s
                                            face was because Zhou Weiqing had truly fallen in a state of sure death.</p>
                                        <p><i>Am I really going to die now? </i>Currently, Zhou Weiqing was facing in
                                            Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er’s direction. Although in the past few days, he
                                            had been having a terrible headache due to the two ladies arguing, but as he
                                            looked at the ladies he loved, looking at the Crescent City in the distance
                                            that was the beginnings of his plan… in Zhou Weiqing’s heart, a flame rose.
                                            He was not reconciled to this, he would not take this defeat just like that!
                                            He still had not revived his homeland, his loves were in front of him… <i>No!
                                                I cannot die like this! I still have to save Father, have to destroy
                                                these invaders and chase them out of my homeland! How can I die just
                                                like this? </i></p>
                                        <p>Such strong feelings of vexation, turning into the deepest resolution. Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s eyes lit up, and his body which was unable to move suddenly
                                            changed… evolved...</p>
                                        <p>The first change was Zhou Weiqing’s eyes. Originally, when he was in the
                                            Dragon-Tiger Transformation state, his eyes were a deep purple. Currently,
                                            they had changed abruptly, his left orb turning fully grey, not just the
                                            pupils but even the whites of the eyes, a cold strange black. The right eye
                                            had also warped, filled with red, not the usual bloodshot but a billowing
                                            fiery red.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s strong and robust body actually expanded further. He had
                                            always been large in stature, especially when in the Demonic Change State or
                                            Dragon-Tiger Transformation, but he now grew even larger. At the same time,
                                            the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation actually warped into a strange
                                            star-hexagon, silently imprinting into in chest area, hiding within the
                                            ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set.</p>
                                        <p>As his body grew, scales began to rise up from below his skin. In contrast
                                            with the usual Dragon-Tiger Transformation state, currently Zhou Weiqing was
                                            giving forth a wild and violent aura from within.</p>
                                        <p><i>What is going on? </i>The assassin’s senses on Zhou Weiqing was extremely
                                            sensitive. After all, his black rapier was still in Zhou Weiqing’s body, and
                                            he could sense that the Nether State was just about to end. Yet, at this
                                            final juncture, Zhou Weiqing’s body exploded with that aura that caused even
                                            him to feel his heart palpitate in sudden fear.</p>
                                        <p>What was that?!</p>
                                        <p>In just that short moment of time, Zhou Weiqing’s body had actually expanded
                                            into a five metre tall giant. To be more accurate, he now looked more like a
                                            giant demonic beast with a vague humanoid shape. Even more strangely, along
                                            with his body expanding, the entire ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set
                                            had vanished. No, the only thing that vanished was the external appearance;
                                            not just the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set, but even all of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s energy seemed to have vanished, or perhaps kept within. His
                                            clothes burst apart. Luckily, his pants were still relatively elastic
                                            enough, and a certain portion was still relatively hidden.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body was filled with a layer of deep purple
                                            scales, even his wings. His entire body was glowing purple, and on his
                                            forehead, a black tattoo of the ‘King’ word appeared, extremely
                                            eye-catching. In that instant, the assassin suddenly felt a powerful
                                            explosive strength from within Zhou Weiqing’s body, just in the instant that
                                            the Nether State ended, forcing his black rapier out.</p>
                                        <p>Abruptly turning around, Zhou Weiqing’s grey and red eyes were filled with a
                                            strange yet terrifying aura. An unbelievably strong energy reverberation
                                            exploded out, as if it were about to tear the entire world apart.</p>
                                        <p>In the skies, a strange vision appeared. The entire sky turned half red, half
                                            grey. On the red side, along with a loud dragons’ roar, a massive illusory
                                            dragon appeared. On the grey side, a giant black illusory tiger with wings
                                            also appeared.</p>
                                        <p>“Heaven and Earth Anomaly, Heavenly God Tier?!” For the first time, the
                                            assassin’s expression actually changed. He could not believe his eyes. This
                                            Zhou Weiqing was a mere six-Jeweled Upper level Zun Stage… how… how could he
                                            possibly give forth the aura of a Heavenly God Tier? Furthermore, that
                                            strange anomaly in the skies were just too weird... impossible!</p>
                                        <p>In his impression, the only person who could cause such an anomaly was the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian. When Xue AoTian unleashed his full
                                            power, the skies would turn white, and an illusory figure of a huge white
                                            tiger would appear, fully covering the entire skies. However, the current
                                            anomaly in the skies might be large, but it covered only a thousand metres
                                            in area… and it also had two illusory figures. Even so, despite the smaller
                                            size, it was still an impressive sight indeed.</p>
                                        <p>Instead of retreating, Zhou Weiqing advanced in a flash. Currently, he was
                                            not able to unleash any Skills. Perhaps more accurately, he was not even
                                            fully conscious.</p>
                                        <p>The wings behind his back had expanded to almost twice their normal size,
                                            along with that terrifying scale armour and the right leg that had warped
                                            into a massive black hook. Zhou Weiqing looked like a demonic god that had
                                            risen from hell.</p>
                                        <p>Both his hands looked different. The right hand was a tiger’s paw, while the
                                            left hand was a dragon’s claw. As his body flashed, his movement was so fast
                                            that it could even rival a Spatial Blink. In that moment, his speed was even
                                            faster than the Agility Type assassin!</p>
                                        <p>Facing absolute death, with that powerful unreconciled feelings in his heart,
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s deep inner potential final burst forth. The Dragon-Tiger
                                            Transformation was the fusion of the Solidified Dragon Spirit and his Dark
                                            Demon God Tiger Bloodline. With such powerful bloodlines, and suffering so
                                            much for so long, could it be just so simple? The wings were just brought
                                            about from the bloodline power of the Dark Demon God Tiger, while the hidden
                                            scales were just a surface addition from the dragon bloodline. Originally,
                                            the Dragon-Tiger Transformation already had a powerful boost to Zhou
                                            Weiqing, but it was far from truly using the full power of the fusion. The
                                            reason was simple - Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation level was just too low, not
                                            able to truly harness their power.</p>
                                        <p>However, at this current moment, in the face of death, the hidden bloodline
                                            powers and energies in the depths of his body had exploded out. The
                                            Dragon-Tiger Transformation entered a second advanced stage.</p>
                                        <p>Dragon-Tiger Transformation Second State: ‘Like Dragon Equivalent Tiger’. [1.
                                            Can’t think of any synonyms that sound good in english, this really sounds
                                            so much better in mandarin]</p>
                                        <p>The current Zhou Weiqing had all his energy, including his Consolidated
                                            Equipment and Stored Skills, fully fused into his Dragon-Tiger bloodline.
                                            The profound secret behind the second state was exactly that, to transform
                                            all energies into actual physical power. That was to say, no matter his
                                            Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills, all his Heavenly Energy, the
                                            original Dragon-Tiger Transformation state, Immortal Deity Technique… all of
                                            it were incorporated together as if thrown together in a cauldron and fused
                                            together, spreading into his body and boosting his physical strength and
                                            toughness. In that in instant, his body had reached a new terrifying
                                            level.</p>
                                        <p>In such a state, Zhou Weiqing was only left with simple hand to hand combat
                                            and brawling. However, his strength in that area was also raised to the
                                            maximum, no matter offense or defense.</p>
                                        <p>The assassin was after all an old hand on the battlefield, and though he had
                                            never heard or seen of something like this, after a moment of surprise he
                                            quickly regained his calmness. As an assassin, no matter what happened, even
                                            if facing death, he would not panic.</p>
                                        <p>His body flew back in a burst of speed. His flying speed was just dependant
                                            on the normal Heavenly King powerhouse’s flying abilities, but in a short
                                            period of time he could explode in an astonishing speed. As he retreated,
                                            the black rapier pierced forward, a glint of sword flurry as it pierced
                                            towards Zhou Weiqing’s chest once more.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s left dragon claw lifted, grabbing towards the eight-Jeweled
                                            Assembly Set Sword. An earsplitting grinding sound rang out, and to the
                                            assassin’s shock, his weapon that had an offense close to that of a
                                            Legendary Set was actually grabbed and held onto by Zhou Weiqing’s left
                                            claw. Next, a terrifying power that was far beyond a Heavenly King Stage
                                            traveled from the rapier, and Zhou Weiqing actually forcefully pulled the
                                            assassin back towards him.</p>
