                                            he realised that something was up… he could clearly see her Physical Jewels
                                            faintly below her armour, and the number was definitely not what he had
                                            expected!</p>
                                        <p>However, by this point, it was too late for him to think too much. As the
                                            Regiment Commander, and the strongest powerhouse of the entire Heavy
                                            Infantry Regiment, he could only do his best to give their opponents a heavy
                                            blow on the nose to teach them a lesson. On the battlefield, there was no
                                            such thing as mercy. Although his opponent was a young woman, he would not
                                            harbour thoughts of holding back.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er was just too quick. In that short period of time when Oni’s
                                            psyche was readjusting himself, she had already reached in front of him. Her
                                            right fist opened up in a palm grab towards Oni’s throat.</p>
                                        <p>Oni gave a grim laugh, his left hand lifting up at lightning speed in a parry
                                            of Shangguan Fei’er’s incoming hand. At the same time, his right fist struck
                                            out, his powerful Heavenly Energy surrounding his fist and striking out
                                            ahead. His Physical Jewel was Strength, and with this punch, he had used
                                            almost eighty percent of his Heavenly Energy, aiming to defeat his opponent
                                            with a single blow to boost the morale of his troops.</p>
                                        <p>A gleam of disdain flashed in Shangguan Fei’er’es eyes, and her body only
                                            moved slightly to the side. At that moment, all Oni could see was that
                                            Shangguan Fei’er seemed to actually twist in a strange movement, and his
                                            powerful fist filled with Heavenly Energy felt as if it had all the strength
                                            in the world, but nowhere to use it. In a flash, there was a blur before his
                                            eyes and Shangguan Fei’er’s hand towards his throat had twisted in an
                                            unbelievable angle to instead grab onto the wrist of his punching fist. The
                                            next instant, Oni felt Shangguan Fei’er close in on him.</p>
                                        <p>Oni’s combat experience was also extremely abundant, and he instantly reacted
                                            by circulating all his Heavenly Energy, bursting forth from his body. With
                                            his Heavenly Xu Stage cultivation level, he planned to use his Heavenly
                                            Energy and thick armour to take her attacks head-on. At the same time, his
                                            arms exerted full force in bringing them together, attempting to grab hold
                                            of Shangguan Fei’er in a bear hug.</p>
                                        <p>In this, he did not have any dirty thoughts, more a subconscious reaction to
                                            subdue his enemy. However, in doing so, he had deeply offended the Little
                                            Demon Girl in front of him.</p>
                                        <p>In Shangguan Fei’er’s heart, besides her Little Fatty, what other man had the
                                            qualification to hug her?</p>
                                        <p>A pull and a throw. Oni felt a sharp pain on his wrist, and he was shocked to
                                            find that Shangguan Fei’er’s fingers were like metal hooks, easily piercing
                                            through the thick armour around his wrists, her own Heavenly Energy moving
                                            in a cockscrew motion that forcefully broke through his protective Heavenly
                                            Energy aura. Next, he saw her jump right up, and his own arm went numb. All
                                            he could do was watch Shangguan Fei’er’s last action as her knee savagely
                                            smashed into the center of his chest armour.</p>
                                        <p>With a loud crash, Oni’s body flew like a cannonball. Despite all his heavy
                                            armour, he had been directly smashed more than twenty yards away by
                                            Shangguan Fei’er’s angry strike. That was also after she had dispersed some
                                            of the attack at the last moment to hold back, otherwise the blow might have
                                            shattered several of his ribs.</p>
                                        <p>The two of them had exchanged blows just too quickly, and from the distance,
                                            it just looked like a single person had charged out from the Peerless
                                            Battalion, clashing right into the strongest powerhouse of the Heavy
                                            Infantry Regiment, Oni. However, in just the time it took to draw a breath,
                                            Oni had been sent flying away.</p>
                                        <p>This was also the reason why all the watching officers had their jaws
                                            agape.</p>
                                        <p>In their wildest imaginations, none of them would have even dreamed that the
                                            situation would reach such a level so quickly. After all, Oni was a powerful
                                            seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master!</p>
                                        <p>Before they could react, the rest of the two sides smashed into each
                                            other.</p>
                                        <p>What were all these Peerless Battalion fellows? Most of them were bellicose
                                            and loved to fight. Originally, in the army, none of them were of good
                                            temper, and that was one of the reasons why they had been sent to the
                                            various Ruffian Battalions. Now that they were in the Peerless Battalion,
                                            the several consecutive victories had given them the confidence of gaining
                                            victory. The three thousand of them who had been selected were definitely
                                            the most elite amongst the entire Peerless Battalion, amongst them were the
                                            original one thousand five hundred Peerless Battalion soldiers who had first
                                            followed Zhou Weiqing. These few days, these ‘old’ soldiers had worked extra
                                            hard indeed after being showed up by the newcomers. The cultivation of
                                            Physical Jewel Masters was not as tough as Heavenly Jewel Masters, and all
                                            of them had more or less some improvement in their Heavenly Energy. Amongst
                                            them, there were still quite a few various Main Company Leaders, Company
                                            Leaders or other ranking officers, definitely not an easy bunch to deal
                                            with.</p>
                                        <p>As both sides crashed into each other, the result was unbelievably different
                                            from all the expectations of the waiting spectators.</p>
                                        <p>Right in front of them, the Heavy Infantry soldiers were being sent flying
                                            like tin cans being kicked around. In a blink of an eye, almost a few
                                            hundred soldiers had been sent flying just like Oni. As for the Peerless
                                            Battalion side, they had not even suffered a single loss.</p>
                                        <p>In such a massive clash of close combat, sometimes strength was more
                                            important than skill. As such, the most outstanding performances were
                                            definitely the two thousand Gold Crow and Berserker Tribe warriors that had
                                            just joined the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Without mentioning the Berserker Tribe first, just the ladies of the Gold
                                            Crow Tribes were like war goddesses descending from the heavens. Their
                                            average weight was more than six hundred jin, and though they were not in
                                            any armour, they already weighed more than those Heavy Infantry soldiers in
                                            their full armour.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, when they had fought against the charge of the Wolf Cavalry
                                            soldiers and Unicorn Cavalry soldiers, even without proper equipment and
                                            weapons, they had managed to hold those two powerful foes at bay for so
                                            long, holding out until Zhou Weiqing brought in reinforcements. Just from
                                            that alone, one could imagine how powerful they were at close combat.</p>
                                        <p>The fight styles of the lady warriors of the Gold Crow Tribe was simple, just
                                            one action no matter what their opponents did - charge, dip shoulder and
                                            ram.</p>
                                        <p>The actions might be simple and straightforward, but it was definitely
                                            effective. Most of those Heavy Infantry soldiers which had been sent flying
                                            were done so by them.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the Berserker Tribe warriors were no weaker than the Gold Crow
                                            Tribe warriors. Their weight might not be comparable to them, but their
                                            fighting prowess was no weaker, perhaps even more powerful. After all, the
                                            Berserker Tribe was famed for their ferocity and love for battle, and as
                                            their name suggested, their frenzy in battle. When in combat, they could use
                                            a bloodline power of theirs, Berserking. A Berserker Tribe warrior who had
                                            entered Berserk mode would have his skin turn even harder than metal, and
                                            his strength would also increase drastically, becoming no lesser than that
                                            of a Gold Crow Tribe warrior. In that state, they were also immune to pain.
                                            At least in terms of hand to hand combat, they were definitely far superior
                                            than the Gold Crow Tribe warriors.</p>
                                        <p>These Berserker Tribe warrior, each at least two metres tall, directly faced
                                            their opposing Heavy Infantry soldiers, and they actually just dared to grab
                                            them and lift them at directly, throwing them savagely out into the
                                            distance. As for the Heavy Infantry soldiers’ attacks, they did not even
                                            bother defending themselves, allowing the attacks to smash into them, though
                                            they did not even leave any mark.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to these two powerful tribe warriors who were extremely suited to
                                            close combat, although the Peerless Battalion soldiers were all Jewel
                                            Masters and equipped with their titanium mail, their efficiency in close
                                            combat was no match. This was just a sheer difference in physical prowess,
                                            but that did not mean their results were weak at all.</p>
                                        <p>After having trained with Shangguan Fei’er in close combat for so long, all
                                            of their close combat capabilities had gone through a qualitative leap.
                                            Furthermore, all of them were Jewel Masters, and with their Heavenly Energy,
                                            even if their opponents were carefully selected, well trained and powerful,
                                            dressed in full armour, they still held the advantage.</p>
                                        <p>The powerhouses of the Peerless Battalion were just too many, and even when
                                            the opponent’s Battalion Leaders, Company Leaders or various officers came
                                            out, the officers of the Peerless Battalion immediately rushed to meet them.
                                            As such, the fight was just still fully one sided.</p>
                                        <p>Convulsions was a term that would be descriptive of an illness, but using
                                            this term now on all the spectating Northwest Army officers would be
                                            extremely accurate.</p>
                                        <p>Their face muscles were all twitching involuntarily… none of them had
                                            expected that this would be the result of the fight.</p>
                                        <p>The clash had only started for a few minutes, and the Heavy Infantry soldiers
                                            were falling like wheat being harvested.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, the Heavy Infantry soldiers indeed had much shocking power on the
                                            battlefield, but at the same time with such heavy armour, once they fell
                                            down it would be rather difficult for them to get up, especially after
                                            taking such heavy blows.</p>
                                        <p>Yet, on the reverse side, for the Peerless bAttalion, there were at least
                                            twenty to thirty powerhouses running wild around the Heavy Infantry Regiment
                                            unchecked, wreaking havoc all around. Every time anyone of them took action,
                                            one Heavy Infantry soldier would fall. Furthermore, besides a very small
                                            number of Peerless Battalion soldier who had met with the opponent officers
                                            and were beaten down, they were able to get up easily, hoping that Shangguan
                                            Fei’er had not noticed them. Although their titanium mail was extremely
                                            light, in terms of defense it was not inferior to their opponent’s full
                                            plate armour. After all, it was titanium alloy!</p>
                                        <p>In a matter of moments, Shangguan Fei’er did not even bother continuing, as
                                            the outcome of the fight was already too clear - a total crushing
                                            victory.</p>
                                        <p>Fighting close combat? With an entire punch of Jewel Masters... or a warriors
                                            with superior bloodline skills and attributes? Even if it were a WanShou
                                            Empire army Regiment taking the place of the Heavy Infantry Regiment, the
                                            Peerless Battalion would not be afraid of them.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji stared with his jaw agape at the scene in front of him. He did not
                                            know when, but Hua Feng had rode up next to him casually, saying in a low
                                            tone: “Legion Commander Shen Ji, don’t you think you should end the fight in
                                            advance? If we keep beating on the Heavy Infantry Regiment, I’m afraid their
                                            confidence might be destroyed. Furthermore, we are after all going to be
                                            cooperating on the battlefield, and we are all allies, it won’t be too good
                                            to have our relationship strained too much.”</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing Hua Feng speak, only then did Shen ji come to his senses.
                                            However, when he heard those words, they just seemed so cutting, so mocking.
                                            He truly felt like pushing this fellow down to the ground and beating him
                                            up!</p>
                                        <p>This was truly getting the advantage and still rubbing salt in others’
                                            wounds! Afraid of destroying the Heavy Infantry Regiment’s confidence? Those
                                            Peerless Battalion soldiers were like hunting wolves or tigers, even some of
                                            those fallen Heavy Infantry soldiers, they would continue beating them up.
                                            Was this how they showed their ‘fear’ of destroying others’ confidence?
                                            Where was there any sign of mercy or leniency?!</p>
                                        <p>“Stop! Everyone stop!” Shen Ji used all his Heavy Energy into his voice, and
                                            it reverberated all the way into the distance.</p>
                                        <p>Well, the Heavy Infantry soldiers all stopped. After all, they truly beaten.
                                            However, on the Peerless Battalion side, there was no sign of any of those
                                            ruffians wanting to stop. At least the Berserker and Gold Crow Tribe
                                            soldiers were more honest; as soon as they heard Shen Ji’s command, they
                                            immediately stopped.</p>
                                        <p></p>
