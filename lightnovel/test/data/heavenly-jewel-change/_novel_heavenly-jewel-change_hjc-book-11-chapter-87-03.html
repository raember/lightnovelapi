                                            skill with that kind of power, he could not think of anything else besides
                                            the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura which could save his life.
                                            Even though he was in the Demonic Change state, he could not possibly use
                                            his body to take a full on blow from such a Skill, that was probably even
                                            more powerful than any ordinary seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master’s.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, the Holy Flames of Light was just too powerful, being a Fusion Skill.
                                            Furthermore, Shen Little Demon’s cultivation level was originally already
                                            more than twelve levels higher than Zhou Weiqing. The moment Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura appeared, crack started
                                            appearing on it, and it looked like it was just going to delay the
                                            inevitable.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of quick thinking and reaction in the midst of combat, Zhou Weiqing
                                            was definitely extremely strong. At this instance of life and death, he
                                            almost subconsciously reacted to save himself.</p>
                                        <p>His Demonic Right Foot slammed hard onto the ground, and the ensuing massive
                                            explosion caused a shockwave that pushed back the surrounding flames
                                            momentarily. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s body sank down into the stage;
                                            his foot had smashed the ground of the stage below him, causing him to drop
                                            down into the depths of the stage. At the same time, he lifted up the dual
                                            legendary hammers which had appeared in his hands, protecting his head from
                                            above.</p>
                                        <p>The Demonic Change added on to his two Legendary Dual God Strength Hammers,
                                            it could be said that Zhou Weiqing was at the utter peak of his power at
                                            that point. Furthermore, the flames were sweeping across the stage, before
                                            rising into the air, and not heading downwards. No one had expected Zhou
                                            Weiqing to use such a strange method to avoid the brunt of the flames.</p>
                                        <p>Including Wu Yuehan, the few who were almost about to take action to save him
                                            stopped in their tracks as soon as they saw the Dark Gold Light and the
                                            explosion.</p>
                                        <p>The Holy Flames of Light had come quickly, but they also disappeared quickly.
                                            After all, it was a powerful skill somewhat beyond Shen Little Demon’s
                                            current level, and it took a huge toll on her Heavenly Energy, especially
                                            since she had ignored any efficiency.</p>
                                        <p>Never in her wildest dreams that Zhou Weiqing would actually also use the
                                            same tactic as she did earlier, to use the Consolidating Equipment God
                                            Protective Aura; more so, that weird and unexpected move of burrowing down
                                            into the stage which had ultimately saved his life from her sure-kill
                                            shot.</p>
                                        <p>In that moment, Shen Little Demon was suddenly struck by uncertainty. <i>Was
                                            this fellow really a three-Jeweled Heavenly Shi Jewel Master? </i>From the
                                            start of their fight, Zhou Weiqing had already used Darkness, Evil, Spatial,
                                            Wind and Lightning, five attributes! Furthermore, two of them were greater
                                            attributes, and that wasn’t even considering the Evil Attribute. More
                                            importantly, he had also managed to use the Heavenly Demon Sect’s
                                            famed(notorious) Demonic Change. As if that wasn’t enough, he had also
                                            unleashed a God Tier Consolidated Equipment!</p>
                                        <p>Shen Little Demon was certain that even amongst all the Five Great Saint
                                            Lands, she would not be able to find another three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master equal to him.</p>
                                        <p>However, despite all the thoughts and doubts in her mind, her attacks did not
                                            waver or slow in any way.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing had temporarily saved his life by dodging from the Holy
                                            Flames of Light, that had also left him stuck in the middle of the ground,
                                            totally surrounded by tough diamond-rock, with no place to escape.</p>
                                        <p>Earlier, the Consolidated short blade which had been expelled by Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s Heavenly Lightning Shock reappeared once more in Shen Little
                                            Demon’s hands. She did not use any other Consolidated Equipment, as her
                                            Heavenly Energy was already frighteningly low. Besides the huge expenditure
                                            from the Holy Flames of Light, just Zhou Weiqing’s two usage of the Devour
                                            Skill had already taken almost twenty percent of her Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>As the short blade slashed through the air savagely, a huge mass of flames
                                            forming the shape of a knife formed in front of it, smashing downwards
                                            towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Just like Han Bing’s focus on the Cone of Cold, Shen Little Demon also had a
                                            Skill that she focused most of her attention on; and it was the skill she
                                            was using right now, Blaze Cut. Its range was almost twenty yards, and it
                                            held an impressive piercing power behind the unbelievable heat. As for how
                                            this Blaze Cut Skill was used, it was one of the secret arts of the Blood
                                            Red Hell, with only those of direct lineage could learn. It wasn’t just
                                            Storing the Skill, but also the method of using it and everything down to
                                            the type of Consolidated Equipment short blade.</p>
                                        <p>As the Blaze Cut slashed downwards, Zhou Weiqing leapt up from the hole he
                                            was in. At the same time, he threw both the hammers in his hands towards
                                            Shen Little Demon.</p>
                                        <p>The smiling and crying face symbols on the massive dark-gold hammers were
                                            very clear, but both hammers were currently looking very different from each
                                            other.</p>
                                        <p>On the huge hammer flying ahead, it was glowing with a thick silver-green
                                            glow; while the one flying behind had its usual dark-gold hue. One front,
                                            one back, they flew at breakneck speed accompanied by a whistling sound as
                                            it cut through the air.</p>
                                        <p>This was the benefit of the immense physical strength of Zhou Weiqing when in
                                            his Demonic Change state.</p>
                                        <p>When a person’s strength reached a certain point, just physical strength was
                                            sufficient to accomplish many things, and was almost not inferior to
                                            ordinary Stored Skills. Furthermore, what Zhou Weiqing had thrown was after
                                            all Legendary Consolidated Equipment!</p>
                                        <p>After throwing the hammers, Zhou Weiqing did not follow through with them, as
                                            if he was giving up on his Legendary hammers. Instead, he just landed beside
                                            the hole he had created. His body leaning forward, he stood hard on his left
                                            leg as a pivot, bringing his entire body almost at a horizontal position in
                                            line with the ground, while his pitch-black right leg was lifted right into
                                            the air.</p>
                                        <p>The strange hook formed at his right foot seemed to glow in a strange, almost
                                            demonic, light.</p>
                                        <p>In mid air, the glowing silver green hammer with the crying face symbol flew
                                            right towards its target. No one else knew it, but this was currently the
                                            true weighted hammer of the set.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had used his archery training as a basis for throwing the
                                            hammers, and would definitely not miss.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Little Demon could have easily moved her attack aside, allowing the
                                            Blaze Cut to avoid the hammers and continue towards Zhou Weiqing. However,
                                            would she actually do such a thing?</p>
                                        <p>The answer was clearly no.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had already given her too many surprises. Furthermore, the
                                            hammers he threw out were after all God Tier Consolidated Equipment. Any God
                                            Tier Consolidated Equipment was definitely extremely powerful, and had their
                                            own hidden secrets. Furthermore, it was clear that this first incoming
                                            hammer of Zhou Weiqing’s had some sort of Fusion Skill of his own as
                                            well.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, that silver-green coloured glow around the hammer represented the
                                            Silver Emperor Spatial Rend; the Fusion Skill which combined the Silver
                                            Emperor Wing Slash and the Spatial Rend to form one of the Silver Emperor’s
                                            most destructive skills.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the reason why Zhou Weiqing could use this Fusion Skill had
                                            nothing to do with the six or seven Jeweled cultivation level bottleneck.
                                            When he had Stored those Skills, they had came with the ability of Fusing
                                            together to form the Skill - one of the Silver Emperor’s innate abilities…
                                            it could be said that he had Stored the Fusion Skill of the Silver Emperor.
                                            Although the expenditure of Heavenly Energy was immense, it was still an
                                            amazing ability especially at his three-Jeweled cultivation level. Moreover,
                                            he had used his Legendary Hammer in order to help improve efficiency and
                                            increase its power as well!</p>
                                        <p>The Legendary Hammers were able to help him reduce almost half of his
                                            expenditure of any Stored Skill, and increase the power by almost double.
                                            Compared to even some ordinary God Tier Consolidated Equipments, this hammer
                                            showed why Legendary Sets were even more so highly desired.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Shen Little Demon did not know all of that, but even with what she
                                            could observe, it was enough to prevent her from letting the hammer get
                                            through to hit her, and she allowed the Blaze Cut to clash with it
                                            instead.</p>
                                        <p>A deafening explosion once again shook the entire Plaza, raining fire as it
                                            spread out in amazing pyrotechnics. In theory, the Blaze Cut couldn’t
                                            possibly be more powerful than a Fusion Skill consisting of two Ten-Star
                                            Rated Skills, but the difference between the two Heavenly Jewel Masters’
                                            cultivation levels was just too great.</p>
                                        <p>In that clash, the Blaze Cut had dissipated, while the first legendary hammer
                                            of Zhou Weiqing also fell down to the ground, the Silver Emperor Spatial
                                            Rend totally expended. However, the other hammer, with the smiling face
                                            symbol, which had been right behind, had by now reached Shen Little Demon
                                            unhindered.</p>
                                        <p>To Shen Little Demon, it seemed like this hammer did not have any skills
                                            imbued within. However, she did not dare take any risks; she did not attempt
                                            to parry it with her short blade, instead keeping it away and pushing out
                                            with both her hands. Instantly, a huge surge of Heavenly Energy expelled out
                                            of her palms, blocking the hammer.</p>
                                        <p>Although Shen Little Demon’s Blaze Cut had clashed with the first hammer from
                                            a distance, she was still able to sense the terrifying weight of it, as well
                                            as the sheer power behind it. As such, facing this other hammer, she braced
                                            herself with all her might.</p>
                                        <p>This was indeed another of the twin hammer’s tricks.</p>
                                        <p>*Poof* The hammer was indeed knocked back, and Shen Little Demon’s entire
                                            power was unleashed into midair, but she did not feel any weight or attack
                                            behind it at all!</p>
                                        <p>Even with a power and cultivation like her own, striking out like that into
                                            nothingness and losing her balance was indeed no a good feeling. Her body
                                            stumbled forward, her entire balance disrupted. If not for her considerable
                                            skill and control, just that misuse of power could have caused her to vomit
                                            blood and sustain a severe internal injury.</p>
                                        <p>However, even though she barely managed to control herself, she also lost the
                                            opportunity to continue unleashing an attack on Zhou Weiqing. At the same
                                            time, she could clearly sense that she had not been unaffected by that,
                                            feeling her movements slow down.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, although the second hammer did not seem to have anything behind it,
                                            it actually had a hidden Skill imbued within! There was only one skill, and
                                            it was the Absolute Delay! With a loud *Peng* sound, Shen Little Demon
                                            landed on the stage, with that misuse of power and being affected by the
                                            Absolute Delay, it was truly a miracle that she remained uninjured, but she
                                            still wasn’t able to fully control herself and smashed down onto the stage.
                                            Despite her protective Heavenly Energy, she was still dazed momentarily.</p>
                                        <p>In the eyes of the audience, Shen Little Demo had been struck down by the
                                            hammer.</p>
                                        <p>By now, not only were the members of the Fei Li Battle Team gathered around
                                            their Rest House entrance; even the members of the Dan Dun Battle Team on
                                            the other side were also doing the same, all of them tensed and nervous as
                                            they watched the battle unfold before them.</p>
                                        <p>No one, not even Lin TianAo, could have imagined that Shen Little Demon, a
                                            top genius from the Blood Red Hell, at the six-Jeweled cultivation level,
                                            could actually be suppressed by Zhou Weiqing. That was even after she had
                                            unleashed that powerful Holy Flames of Light!</p>
                                        <p>With a quick flip, Shen Little Demon jumped back from the ground. However,
                                            the Absolute Delay made her feel like she had lost her rhythm, feeling
                                            extremely awkward as if she weren’t in her own body. No matter how she
                                            circulated her Heavenly Energy, she was unable to shake that strange
                                            feeling. As such, when she stood up, she was still not in a proper form with
                                            perfect balance, facing directly into Zhou Weiqing who was already poised in
                                            that strange position of his.</p>
                                        <p>The thing that drew her attention instantly was definitely that right leg of
                                            his which was lifted high up in the air. Earlier, it was just this right leg
                                            which had almost destroyed her Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura.
                                            Currently, it was her first time examining it closely, and she finally could
                                            clearly see that his right leg had actually turned into a strange black
                                            hook, and that hook was now actually shining with a strange light.</p>
                                        <p>Black, Grey, Blue. Three colours swirled around the black hook, forming a
                                            warped looking ball of light. Zhou Weiqing’s entire body was trembling, as
                                            he stood there supported on his single leg.</p>
                                        <p></p>
