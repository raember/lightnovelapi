                                            point, they could easily bring that little rascal into the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace, and Bing’er could marry him in a simple rational progression. With
                                            his outstanding talents and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s resources and
                                            guidance, the future him would become Shangguan Xue’er’s future right hand
                                            man, and this future generation would definitely be able to support the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace to a far greater height.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, Shangguan Tianyue had never expected that his second daughter would
                                            actually run off with that little brat as well. Her excuse was that she was
                                            keeping an eye on him and not allowing him to shift affections and abandon
                                            Bing’er… However, did keeping an eye require her to do so personally? Or to
                                            take so long? She had even refused to come back even when Zhan LingTian had
                                            asked her too...</p>
                                        <p>As for the Blood Red Hell, on the contrary, Shangguan Tianyue was not worried
                                            about them. Before Zhan LingTian had even returned, he had already received
                                            news from the Blood Red Hell about what had happened. Regarding the matter,
                                            the Second Hell Master of the Blood Red Hell had actually came down to the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace personally to apologize. Furthermore, he had brought
                                            along a gift of a Heavenly Emperor Stage Heavenly Beast as an offering to
                                            their continued friendship, and that was clearly a strong sign of good
                                            faith. More importantly, the result of the attack had been that no loss or
                                            harm had come to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and thus it was easily
                                            resolved.</p>
                                        <p>“LingTian, in your eyes, how did Fei’er treat Zhou Weiqing?” Shangguan
                                            Tianyue finally asked solemnly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian lowered his head and said: “It’s hard to say.”</p>
                                        <p>“Hard to say? Speak the truth!” Shangguan Tianyue raised his voice
                                            slightly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian hesitated for a moment before saying: “Second Young Miss seems
                                            to be overly close to that Zhou Weiqing, and they do not seem like ordinary
                                            friends. Yet, they are not intimate in any way. As for what is the exact
                                            relationship between them, I do not know.”</p>
                                        <p>With the eyes of a Heavenly Jewel Master, it was an easy task to see whether
                                            a girl was still ‘whole’, and though Zhan LingTian was still a virgin, he
                                            could still easily see that. It was also the reason why he was willing to
                                            take his time to come back, not at all in a rush to report back. He was more
                                            than happy to have Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er end up having intimate
                                            relations, and having Shangguan Tianyue angry with Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, Zhan LingTian also hid a truth. He did not mention anything
                                            about the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, as he did not want Zhou Weiqing to
                                            grow more important in Shangguan Tianyue’s eyes.</p>
                                        <p>“Hmph!” Shangguan Tianyue gave an angry grunt. “That little brat, courting
                                            one of my daughters isn’t enough for him? Is he trying to chase Fei’er as
                                            well? Our Little Demon Girl Fei’er actually didn’t cause trouble for him,
                                            instead staying together with him? Hmph, that brat!”</p>
                                        <p>Alas for Zhan LingTian, no matter how he listened in, he just felt that
                                            Shangguan Tianyue’s voice was rather weird… as if he wasn’t really that
                                            angry.</p>
                                        <p>“Second Palace Master, should I go back again and bring Second Young Miss
                                            back?” Zhan LingTian asked tentatively.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue glanced at him and said exasperatedly: “Can you really
                                            bring Fei’er back? With Fei’er’s cultivation level, and with Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            help, the two of them working together… even you will not be able to do
                                            anything against them. Look, even Han Tianyou actually took damage from the
                                            few of you.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian’s expression instantly turned slightly ugly, but he did not
                                            protest at that truth.</p>
                                        <p>“Alright, dismissed. This time, you have done well, and you have not thrown
                                            our Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s face in front of the Blood Red Hell. Still,
                                            you need to work hard and cultivate. Xue’er is yet another step closer to
                                            the eight-Jeweled stage.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing those words, Zhan LingTian’s body shook. With Shangguan Tianyue
                                            saying that she was one step closer, that naturally meant she had raised a
                                            level of Heavenly Energy. In that case, Shangguan Xue’er had already caught
                                            up with him in terms of Heavenly Energy, reaching the same stage! More so,
                                            she was much younger than he was! Instantly, an invisible pressure seemed to
                                            weigh down on Zhan LingTian, causing him to find it difficult to even
                                            breathe.</p>
                                        <p>“Yes, Second Palace Master, I will definitely work hard and cultivate.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhan Lingtian bowed down respectfully before Shangguan Tianyue before backing
                                            out of the room.</p>
                                        <p>Watching him leave, the anger on Shangguan Tianyue’s face slowly subsided,
                                            and he gave a soft sigh before muttering to himself: “LongTian, this child,
                                            he is truly not bad. Alas, his view of the bigger picture is just too
                                            narrow, not even a match for Zhou Weiqing. Such a shame...”</p>
                                        <p>“Father, I will go get Fei’er back.” A cold, clear voice rang out from the
                                            shadows at the side, and a cold-faced Shangguan Xue’er walked out.</p>
                                        <p>Clearly, she had been there for quite some time, only Zhan LingTian did not
                                            know about it.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue looked at Shangguan Xue’er and he said: “Xue’er, what do
                                            you think the reason Fei’er followed Zhou Weiqing?”</p>
                                        <p>Without hesitation, Shangguan Xue’er said: “Curiosity and revenge. Don’t you
                                            know Fei’er’s character? At that time in the Lustre Spatial Realm she lost
                                            out to Zhou Weiqing, how could she possibly let it go so easily?
                                            Furthermore, add to that the curiosity about him, that is probably the
                                            reason she ran off to follow him.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue gave a bitter smile and said: “That little brat Zhou
                                            Weiqing, he wouldn’t chase another one of my daughters right. Hmph, that
                                            would be too huge a loss.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er definitely knew her father much clearer than Zhan LingTian
                                            did, and she looked at him suspiciously as she said: “Father, why do I feel
                                            like you are very happy instead, not angry about Fei’er and Zhou
                                            Weiqing?”</p>
                                        <p>A faint smile crossed Shangguan Tianyue’s lips and he said: “Do I? You can
                                            even tell… Xue’er, looks like you have improved a lot. Well, Fei’er
                                            following Zhou Weiqing is actually not a bad thing in my eyes. At least,
                                            that will let us have some idea what this little brat is up to. Zhou Weiqing
                                            this little rascal is extremely different from most youths. The most
                                            outstanding and impressive thing about him is not his cultivation level or
                                            power, but his will, tenacity and sight. In that aspect, no one in your
                                            generation is able to compare to him, not even you. However, that sort of
                                            thing also poses another problem, a strong draw towards females, especially
                                            when combined with that impressive power and talent of his, that is even
                                            more so. With Fei’er by his side, at least that is far better than having
                                            those Heavenly Demon Sect or Heavenly Snow Mountain ones by his side.
                                            Furthermore, he is at least choosing to develop himself at our ZhongTian
                                            Empire, not any other place.”</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing her father’s words, Shangguan Xue’er was stunned. She had not
                                            imagined that not only did her father’s outward showing of being indisposed
                                            towards Zhou Weiqing just an act, he actually placed such importance upon
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>“Father, but… Zhou Weiqing and Third Sis is already a pair! What would happen
                                            if Fei’er mixed in between them? It was just not long before Third Sis had
                                            just returned to us, and she is still in the midst of closed door
                                            cultivation… No, no, this will not do. If anything happened between Fei’er
                                            and Zhou Weiqing, what would Bing’er do? Mother is still ignoring you, if
                                            such a thing happened on top of everything, I’m afraid.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Shangguan Xue’er mention Tang Xian, a helpless look appeared on
                                            Shangguan Tianyue’s face. Thinking for a moment, he said: “You are right,
                                            but you should know that girl Fei’er’s temper. If she decides on something,
                                            not even ten dragons can drag her from it. I will go speak to your mother
                                            about this. You head to the northern border; you are the only one who can
                                            bring her back. However, I do not want you to show yourself directly
                                            straight away. As the saying goes, The players in the chess game might be
                                            blind to the situation,while a bystander sees everything clearly’[1. This is
                                            a direct translation of an idiom, but the meaning should be pretty clear:)].
                                            You take a close look on Zhou Weiqing’s development in the north and let me
                                            know all about it. At the same time, keep a close eye on that Little Demon
                                            Girl your sister, don’t let her and Zhou Weiqing advance too far beyond,
                                            otherwise things might be troublesome. If she really has that thinking, you
                                            bring her back.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded and said: “That is the only thing we can do now. In
                                            that case, I will pack up and leave then.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er took her leave as well, and looking at his daughter’s
                                            retreating figure, Shangguan Tianyue did not know why but he suddenly had a
                                            bad feeling about things.</p>
                                        <p>If at this moment Zhan LingTian knew that by not bringing Shangguan Fei’er
                                            back, it had ended up in Shangguan Xue’er actually being sent to keep an eye
                                            on Zhou Weiqing, perhaps he would puke blood. This was truly a miraculous
                                            scheme of his to backfire, to lose one's wife as well as one's soldiers[2.
                                            Another direct translation of an idiom (赔了夫人又折兵), basically it means that a
                                            scheme has ended up with a double penalty, or losing the bait along with the
                                            fish]!</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Northern Border. Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing sat cross-legged in his large tent, fully concentrating on
                                            cultivating. A month had passed since he had returned, and ever since that
                                            time, he had spent almost all his time in his tent. As for training the
                                            Peerless Battalion, there was Shangguan Fei’er, his seven masters of the
                                            Heavenly Bow Unit, Wei Feng and the others, and that was more than
                                            sufficient.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo had returned to the TianBei City to take command there and to
                                            ensure things went well. Of course, at the same time, he brought Yun Li and
                                            Little Miss Muddle back there with him. After all, they would be much safer
                                            there than at the Peerless Battalion. Their importance to Zhou Weiqing and
                                            the entire Peerless Battalion was without question.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since his return, Zhou Weiqing had started training in theSix Ultimate
                                            Skill Manipulation Arts. Of course, he had first memorised the entirety of
                                            the little booklet and followed Long Shiya’s instructions to destroy it
                                            after.</p>
                                        <p>The training of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts was much more
                                            difficult that he had expected. It was totally a complicated type of energy
                                            manipulation, conversion and connection.</p>
                                        <p>If one had to make a metaphorical comparison, it would be tantamount to using
                                            the the Three Thousand Tempering Method, but instead of using it on an
                                            individual Skill, it was focusing on the control of Heavenly Energy, but it
                                            was tempering all six types of Attributes Heavenly Energy all at once.</p>
                                        <p>In Zhou Weiqing’s hands, he held six Heavenly King Stage Heavenly Beast’s
                                            Cores, just exactly corresponding to his own six Attributes. The six
                                            Heavenly Cores flew about in his hands, and the Heavenly Energy he was
                                            unleashing also changed at lightning speed as per the Attribute. At the same
                                            time, as he swapped them about, he also had to unleash an ordinary Heavenly
                                            Skill.</p>
                                        <p>However, that Heavenly Skill was not one that he had Stored, but an imitation
                                            with his Heavenly Energy. Of course, being a mere beginner, his imitations
                                            were far from the power that Long Shiya could bring forth. His current puny
                                            imitation couldn’t even kill a rabbit if he tried.</p>
                                        <p>A month of hard work had finally given Zhou Weiqing some understanding of the
                                            Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts. It truly had a high requirement of
                                            understanding Heavenly Energy, the various Attributes and all their aspects,
                                            as well as fine grained control over it all. At his current state, he had
                                            barely taken a first step into this world, and had a much longer road to
                                            travel down this path. The more he trained in it, the more he improved, but
                                            at the same time, the more he realised the sheer intricacies and deep
                                            profound secrets that lay within the tip of the iceberg of cultivation.
                                            Furthermore, what Long Shiya had given him was actually only the entrance
                                            level of the manipulation arts, a mere beginning. Examining his own
                                            progress, Zhou Weiqing was certain that without at least a year or two of
                                            hard work, he would not be able to fully grasp it.</p>
                                        <p>Trying to reach the maximum capabilities of the Six Ultimate Skill
                                            Manipulation Arts was definitely not something that could be accomplished
                                            easily or quickly. It could be said that by training in it, for the
                                            foreseeable future Zhou Weiqing’s actual combat prowess would not increase
                                            directly at all.</p>
