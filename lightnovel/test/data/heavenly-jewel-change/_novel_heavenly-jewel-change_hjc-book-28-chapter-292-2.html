                                            Attribute energy were dispersed in all directions. Be it Long Shiya’s
                                            enormous phantom figure or Shen Mo’s huge mouth, they had both completely
                                            vanished at this moment - none of them could be seen. </p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain shook vigorously – not just it, even the entire
                                            Ten Thousand Beast Heavens swayed violently, as though the end of the world
                                            was coming. Everything was about to be destroyed in a frenzy.</p>
                                        <p>Terrifying energy erupted in the air. As for Zhou Weiqing, he felt extremely
                                            anxious at this moment. Although he was very clear with regards to Long
                                            Shiya’s power, it was his master’s first battle after making a breakthrough
                                            to the Heavenly God Stage. Moreover, they were unaware of how long his
                                            opponent had been a Heavenly God for. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing would rather lose this fight and even the entire Grand
                                            Tournament than to see Long Shiya get injured. Earlier, when Long Shiya’s
                                            Six Ultimate Celestial Territory was being enveloped by the opponent’s
                                            Destruction Celestial Territory, he had already thought of giving up the
                                            fight. However, Long Shiya’s series of attacks after had caused Zhou Weiqing
                                            to be completely shocked, exclaiming in admiration to himself. This was the
                                            actual power of control. Even though Zhou Weiqing possessed the Saint
                                            Energy, together with the six attributes, Long Shiya was way ahead of him in
                                            terms of controlling the attributes. </p>
                                        <p>One would say that Long Shiya was extremely skillful when it came to
                                            controlling the six attributes. The sequence of the attributes, as well as
                                            the pairings and control were all perfect and cleverly executed. From the
                                            looks of it, it was not a joint attack of all six attributes. But in
                                            reality, the planned attacks in such a sequence were a lot more impactful
                                            and powerful than a combined attack. It was much more terrifying on the
                                            whole.</p>
                                        <p>This was power! However, his opponent was a Heavenly God after all. Upon
                                            executing such a precise control, it was a huge burden on Long Shiya’s will.
                                            If he could not defeat his opponent after these attacks, Long Shiya would be
                                            in grave danger. The Peerless Sect had already killed off two Heavenly
                                            Emperors of the Blood Red Hell. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing knew that if they
                                            had given Shen Mo an opportunity, he definitely would not let Long Shiya
                                            off. Be it for the Peerless Sect or Zhou Weiqing, losing a Heavenly God
                                            would be devastating.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had already done all the preparations needed, in the event he
                                            had to step in. Even if it meant going against the regulations, he would not
                                            let his master die on the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>On the other hand, Fen Tian was similarly anxious. He never expected Long
                                            Shiya to become a Heavenly God. If Shen Mo were to win this fight, it would
                                            bring about a lot of opportunities for the Blood Red Hell in this Grand
                                            Tournament, and thus allowing him to continue his plans within the Grand
                                            Tournament. The result of this fight was of great importance. Furthermore,
                                            similarly, in the eyes of the Blood Red Hell, having a Heavenly God
                                            powerhouse who possessed the Destruction Celestial Territory was extremely
                                            important. Perhaps, losing ten Heavenly Emperors would not cause much grief
                                            to Fen Tian. However, if Shen Mo were to die in the fight, then he might
                                            truly go berserk.</p>
                                        <p>Instinctively, Fen Tian lifted his head and looked towards Zhou Weiqing. Both
                                            of them exchanged glances, seemingly noticing the strong killing intent in
                                            each other’s eyes. Not only did they have the intention to save their own
                                            member, they also had to deal with each other. The atmosphere became
                                            intensified as they were on the verge of drawing their swords to fight. </p>
                                        <p>A layer of golden light appeared at this moment. A dense golden light that
                                            was filled with Divine Heavenly aura enveloped the peak of the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>It came from the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian. He swept his gaze
                                            across from Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian. Nobody knew what he was thinking.
                                            However, at the same time, an intense vibrating energy descended from the
                                            sky and a layer of light fog pounded against the golden light curtain. </p>
                                        <p>This was Xue AoTian’s territory. He did not want the Heavenly Snow Mountain
                                            to be destroyed by the fight between Long Shiya and Shen Mo. Hence, he was
                                            the first to take action. In the event that Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian were
                                            to fight each other, they had to break through the layer of obstruction
                                            first, on top of dealing with each other. </p>
                                        <p>Terrifying energy ripples erupted in the air instantly. Shock appeared on
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s face, as a result of what was happening in the sky.</p>
                                        <p>Similarly, Fen Tian was stunned as well. This was because the both of them
                                            had clearly seen the change that occured within the sky. </p>
                                        <p>The darkness that originally filled the sky had been completely obliterated.
                                            The Destruction Celestial Territory had vanished. Ultimately, as a result of
                                            Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya’s full-force attack, it had
                                            exploded. </p>
                                        <p>However, in the sky, Long Shiya’s enormous figure had also disappeared. While
                                            the explosion of the Destruction Celestial Territory had a detrimental
                                            effect on Shen Mo, it was also detrimental to Long Shiya. His will had been
                                            drained too much, to the point that it could not longer support his own Six
                                            Ultimate Celestial Territory. Moreover, it had suffered a huge impact from
                                            the final attack from the Destruction Celestial Territory in its final
                                            moments. </p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Shen Mo and Long Shiya continued to linger in mid-air, except
                                            for the fact that the distance between both parties had been widened to a
                                            thousand meters. They exchanged glances; both their faces had clearly become
                                            paler, particularly Shen Mo. His body was trembling slightly. Long Shiya had
                                            shut both his eyes, and his body swayed lightly for a moment. </p>
                                        <p>It was extremely quiet at the bottom. The collision between both Heavenly
                                            Gods had caused all the powerhouses to be stunned.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya, who paled in comparison in terms of cultivation base and
                                            celestial territory, had forcefully overcome his disadvantage solely based
                                            on his full understanding of the six attributes as well as his immaculate
                                            control over them. At this moment, it was still hard to tell who had emerged
                                            victorious, but at the very least, the Six Ultimate Heavenly God was no
                                            longer on the losing end.</p>
                                        <p>It was safe to say that this was the most spectacular fight in the history of
                                            the Grand Tournament. The fight between both Heavenly Gods had purged almost
                                            all the attribute energy elements within the radius of several hundred
                                            miles. </p>
                                        <p>Shen Mo glared at Long Shiya. Mixed feelings could be seen in his eyes. He
                                            had never expected that his Destruction Celestial Territory that he achieved
                                            after breaking through to the Heavenly God Stage still was unable to defeat
                                            Long Shiya. He was very clear with regards to his current physical condition
                                            - he was injured. As a Heavenly God, his body was terrifyingly strong - it
                                            was exceedingly difficult to injure his body. However, once he got injured,
                                            it would be hard for him to treat his injuries. </p>
                                        <p>The current situation of the two parties was simple - Shen Mo was injured and
                                            had even hurt his vitality, while Long Shiya’s will had been overly drained.
                                            On the whole, Shen Mo was at a slight disadvantage. However, if they were to
                                            fight to the death, they would have to risk perishing together.</p>
                                        <p> “I never expected that you could destroy my Destruction Celestial Territory,
                                            Brother Long. In that case, let’s make it a tie and both be disqualified,
                                            giving other people a chance, shall we? The sequence of the first round will
                                            not be changed,” said Shen Mo in a deep voice. </p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya did not open his eyes. Neither did he argue with him. “Alright.”
                                            Both of them descended at the same time and returned to their respective
                                            Saint Lands. They did the same action at almost the same time, sitting
                                            cross-legged in their respective areas, trying their best to recover their
                                            bodies.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian each went behind their backs, assisting in their
                                            treatment.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian and Shangguan Tianyang exchanged glances; they both had a strange
                                            look in their eyes. Once again, they had benefited from the outcome. They
                                            were very clear that as long as they did not step into the arena, both Long
                                            Shiya and Shen Mo were able to defeat any one of their representatives.
                                            Furthermore, their tie prevented the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace from being directly disqualified from this cycle.</p>
                                        <p>The next participant from the Peerless Sect was a woman. Upon seeing her, the
                                            two brothers, Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue, clearly looked worried. That
                                            was because the next participant from the Peerless Sect was none other than
                                            Shangguan Xue’er. </p>
                                        <p>The situation was no different from the previous cycle. As the tournament
                                            continued, the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had
                                            each sent out a Heavenly King. This time, the Heavenly Snow Mountain had the
                                            upper hand. Upon their victory, they had similarly forfeited, causing the
                                            Passion Valley to go against the Blood Red Hell next. </p>
                                        <p>This time, Huang Xingyun had seemed to learn his lesson - he had immediately
                                            sent out a Heavenly King powerhouse. After a brief consideration, Fen Tian
                                            had sent out a Heavenly Emperor once again. As expected, the Blood Red Hell
                                            emerged victorious. </p>
                                        <p>The two brothers, Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue, had become anxious almost
                                            immediately. Even though they knew that Shangguan Xue’er had become a
                                            Heavenly King, and had also consolidated a few more pieces of the Boundless
                                            Infinitum Set, the person she had to go against was the Blood Red Hell
                                            Heavenly Emperor! How would a Heavenly Emperor that possessed the
                                            Destruction Attribute be easy to deal with? If she were to slip up, she
                                            could very well end up dead. Previously, the Peerless Sect had already
                                            killed off two members of the Blood Red Hell. They would definitely not show
                                            mercy towards Shangguan Xue’er.</p>
                                        <p>The two brothers’ gazes quickly fell upon Zhou Weiqing, who was done
                                            attending to Long Shiya’s injuries. Their gazes were filled with intense
                                            resentment and puzzlement. </p>
                                        <p>The Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor was called Tian Yu. Within the Blood Red
                                            Hell, the two biggest family names were ‘Tian’ and ‘Shen’. They were the two
                                            families that controlled the Blood Red Hell. Fen Tian’s last name was also
                                            ‘Tian’ - the two characters of his name were switched around. Tian Yu was
                                            Fen Tian’s cousin.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the young Shangguan Xue’er, Tian yu could not help but furrow his
                                            brows slightly. He was somewhat disdainful and said, “From the looks of it,
                                            the Peerless Sect only has those two old fellows, Wu Yunyue and Long Shiya.
                                            Now that they are gone, they have no choice but to sent out a little girl
                                            like you to die.”</p>
                                        <p>A cold look flashed across Shangguan Xue’er’s eyes. Just as she was about to
                                            retort, Zhou Weiqing’s voice was heard, “Wait a moment.”</p>
                                        <p>As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing took a huge step forward and slowly stood next to
                                            Shangguan Xue’er. He looked over at Fen Tian and said, “If I remembered
                                            correctly, based on the rules of the Grand Tournament, the leader of any of
                                            the five Great Saint Lands can substitute their own members at any given
                                            time, right?”</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, everyone present was startled. The
                                            Peerless Sect’s power had already been proven by Wu Yunyue and Long Shiya.
                                            Nobody dared to look down on them. However, nobody could comprehend Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s current course of action.</p>
