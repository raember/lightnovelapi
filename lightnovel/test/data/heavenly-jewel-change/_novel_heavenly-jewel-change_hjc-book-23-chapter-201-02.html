                                            Ma Qun was raring to go.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “No, this time the enemy is not the
                                            same. Furthermore, you all have already revealed yourselves in the previous
                                            fight, and the enemies will definitely have prepared something against us
                                            doing something similar. If your two entire Main Companies were here, I
                                            would definitely send you to destroy their confidence. However, you
                                            currently only number two hundred in total, and if you were to be entangled
                                            with the enemy’s two Heavy Cavalry Battalions for too long, even with your
                                            combat prowess and strength, it will not be easy to get out without any
                                            losses.”</p>
                                        <p>At the other side, Lei Zi said: “Boss, then let us go instead. We’ll fly
                                            above their heads and let them know what is the meaning of heavenly soldiers
                                            descending from the skies.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “There will be many chances for all
                                            of you to take action soon. However, I do not want to reveal our Peerless
                                            Air Force quite so early. It isn’t time yet. After all, it is one of our
                                            aces. Prepare your javelins for now… those will be even more effective than
                                            arrows in a siege battle.”</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi nodded and said: “We have already prepared that long ago. Ever since
                                            we entered the Crescent City, we have ordered blacksmiths to continue
                                            crafting them. Furthermore, we have brought quite a number ourselves.” As he
                                            said that, Lei Zi even gestured towards his own Spatial Ring.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, Lin TianAo had been tasked with purchasing as many Spatial
                                            Containment objects as possible, and besides all the high ranking officers
                                            of the Peerless Regiment, the excess Spatial Rings had been issued to the
                                            elites of the First Main Company.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing only had seven hundred proper fighting forces, never
                                            forget that even amongst the Peerless Regiment, those were the cream of the
                                            crop, the elite in all aspects.</p>
                                        <p>“Alright, very good. Prepare for battle at any moment. We still have at least
                                            half a month before our reinforcements arrive. During this period, we must
                                            ensure our city walls stay secured. We must not give our enemies any
                                            opportunity.”</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Regiment officers saluted in agreement as they received the
                                            command.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, what Zhou Weiqing was most worried about was not a full on frontal
                                            attack on the main gates. With the city walls and defensive advantage, it
                                            was nearly impossible to breakthrough the walls guarded by the Peerless
                                            Regiment soldiers. However, they only numbered seven hundred, and they could
                                            not split themselves or appear in more than one places. If the enemy chose
                                            to surround and attack from all sides of the city, their true problem of
                                            having a lack of manpower would reveal itself.”</p>
                                        <p>In order to counter such a possible scenario, Zhou Weiqing had meticulously
                                            assigned his troops. For the Peerless Regiment archers, he placed two
                                            hundred men on the frontal walls, and a hundred on each of the other three
                                            walls. As for the Peerless Heavy Cavalry, in such a siege they would be
                                            Heavy Infantry instead, and with each wall assigned fifty of them. With
                                            their numbers, it was just too difficult to take everything into account,
                                            and this was a difficult but necessary choice to make. As long as the enemy
                                            commander wasn’t a fool, he would have such plans in mind.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, the Peerless Heavy Cavalry were already in position, but the five
                                            hundred Peerless archers were still on the main south wall facing their
                                            enemies. With their Consolidated Wings, they could easily rush to the other
                                            walls when necessary, so they did not need to get into position too
                                            quickly.</p>
                                        <p>On the enemy’s end, the Kalise army did not seem to be in a rush at all as
                                            well. After setting up camp, they actually did not attack for three days.
                                            However, since their camp was merely ten li away from the Crescent City, the
                                            invisible pressure they exerted upon the city was palpable. Without
                                            question, this was a form of psychological warfare, and the current
                                            commander of the Kalise forces was definitely an excellent one.</p>
                                        <p>It was the morning of the fourth day since the Kalise Empire arrived, just
                                            after breakfast, when Zhou Weiqing received an urgent summons to the city
                                            walls. As soon as he reached the walls and looked at the sight before him,
                                            even for Zhou Weiqing’s stable character, he couldn’t help but have an ugly
                                            expression on his face. He finally understood what the Kalise Empire armies
                                            had been waiting for these last three days, and it wasn’t just a
                                            psychological tactic.</p>
                                        <p>A large number of sieging weapons were arriving from the distance into the
                                            Kalise encampment. Amongst them were several siege vehicles specially for
                                            attacking city walls. These siege vehicles were not for knocking down the
                                            city gates, but for holding troops. Each siege vehicle was five metres wide,
                                            ten metres tall, with wheels below them on all four sides. On the top, there
                                            were metal plates covered with cured cowhide, while the front was extremely
                                            thick and heavy with spikes jutting out.</p>
                                        <p>Each of these siege vehicles were able to hold at least fifty soldiers, and
                                            there were push rods within the towers which enabled them to move the siege
                                            vehicles. This way, they could ignore any risks from heavy cavalry charges
                                            or arrows from the walls to move directly to the foot of the walls.</p>
                                        <p>These siege vehicles actually numbered more than fifty. Besides that, there
                                            were also ten large trebuchets, several battering ram carts and various
                                            other specialised siege weapons. Amongst them, the most eye catching were
                                            the four massive siege towers which could be slowly pushed to the front. All
                                            in all, it was clear they were fully prepared for war.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, Zhou Weiqing had not expected that even knowing that the defending
                                            force of the Crescent City was merely three thousand, especially with the
                                            majority being fresh recruits, the Kalise Empire would actually spend so
                                            many resources to launch their attack. From this alone, one could see how
                                            much importance they had placed on this attack.</p>
                                        <p>These siege weapons would definitely bring a lot of trouble to their
                                            defending side, especially those siege vehicles. With them, the advantage of
                                            the Peerless Heavy Cavalry and archers facing open plains before them would
                                            be greatly reduced. With the siege vehicles in front, besides those soldiers
                                            in the actual vehicles, they would also be able to cover another four to
                                            five thousand men to reach the city walls. Along with the siege towers,
                                            ladders, catapults and various siege weapons, it would definitely increase
                                            the pressure on their defending side.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the siege weapons bearing down upon the Crescent City slowly, the
                                            Kalise Empire armies also began their movement.</p>
                                        <p>The fifty siege vehicles were intermingling between the various other siege
                                            weapons, and they were clearly already filled with soldiers. Two Battalions
                                            of Heavy Infantry and the two Battalions of Heavy Cavalry moved forward
                                            along with them, both guarding the siege weaponry while also using them as
                                            cover. At the back, there were at least four more Battalions of infantry
                                            soldiers advancing at a slower pace behind. In just this first offensive
                                            wave, the Kalise army had already sent its main force. From the looks of
                                            things, they did not even seem to be placing much importance on attacking
                                            from the other sides, focusing most of their attention on the frontal
                                            assault.</p>
                                        <p>Tricked! Zhou Weiqing immediately realised his mistake. The enemy commander
                                            had seized upon the fact that he would prepare for the surrounding all-out
                                            assault, and instead changed tactics to focus on the full frontal assault.
                                            With the various siege weapons to assist in their assault, this was not
                                            going to be an easy fight.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, let us charge out and destroy those siege weapons!” On the city walls,
                                            the feelings of all of them were rather oppressed, and Ma Qun couldn’t help
                                            but offer to attack once more.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing waved his hands and said: “No, there are too many enemies now,
                                            especially with the siege vehicles to cover them. It is just too dangerous
                                            for you to charge out now.”</p>
                                        <p>Yan Zhexi said: “Boss, how about transferring back the rest of the Peerless
                                            Heavy Cavalry from the other walls?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “No, the other walls might not be
                                            attacked now, but they may be attacked at any time. Look far off in the
                                            distance, the Kalise Regiment behind has started sending light cavalry
                                            troops using a roundabout fashion to loop around. Although their offense and
                                            sieging capabilities aren’t that strong, just leaving the fresh recruits
                                            alone to withstand their attacks will be a definite loss. Brothers, we will
                                            have a tough fight ahead of us, let’s pluck up our spirits. Once we can
                                            achieve this first victory, we can definitely hold on until our
                                            reinforcements arrive.”</p>
                                        <p>If not for the Heavenly King assassin who might be hiding anywhere close by,
                                            even if the enemy forces were stronger, Zhou Weiqing would not be so dismal.
                                            However, with such a powerful hidden enemy who could attack at anytime, he
                                            had to spend so much focus on being alert for that, keeping his guard up.
                                            This was not a comfortable feeling at all.</p>
                                        <p>The enemy drew closer bit by bit. It was clear that the Kalise commander was
                                            extremely experienced, and his directions were very well placed. He was not
                                            rash or impetuous, not charging forward, instead moving at a slow stable
                                            pace, maintaining perfect formation to fully take advantage of the siege
                                            weapons.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a cold laugh. “Your Father, I, will give you a greeting
                                            gift first.” As he said that, he waved his hands before him, and the Six
                                            Ultimate Godly Light Formation appeared as he unleashed it. At the same
                                            time, he also entered the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state, the large wings
                                            spread out behind his back. All the Jewel Masters present could instantly
                                            sense a huge amount of Heavenly Energy gathering towards Zhou Weiqing,
                                            swarming crazily to him.</p>
                                        <p>Standing at his two flanks, Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er subconsciously drew
                                            closer to him, looking about warily at this point. Zhou Weiqing was about
                                            the launch an attack, and this was undoubtedly a good chance for the
                                            Heavenly King assassin to make his move. As the saying goes, ‘caution is the
                                            parent of safety’, and the two girls naturally raised their guard further in
                                            preparation.</p>
                                        <p>It was not just the two of them. Naturally, Lin TianAo also took up his
                                            position right behind Zhou Weiqing. He was even more direct, with his
                                            seven-Jeweled Assembly Set Shield already released and at the ready. His
                                            eyes were cold as they scanned the area, fully ready to spring into action
                                            at any time.</p>
                                        <p>The Overlord Bow gave forth a chilling aura as Zhou Weiqing drew it to a full
                                            crescent. Abruptly, he gave a loud shout, and with the Six Ultimate Godly
                                            Light Formation glowing about him, in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state,
                                            he truly looked like a demon god atop the city walls. Especially with the
                                            loud shout that was like a tiger’s roar, giving all the soldiers on the city
                                            walls a morale boost.</p>
                                        <p>Facing such a formidable looking force, along with invisible pressure of the
                                            threat from the last few days, the morale of the soldiers on the walls was
                                            slightly suppressed, especially those of the fresh recruits. Zhou Weiqing
                                            may not be an outstanding commander, especially in terms of ‘normal’
                                            military tactics, but in terms of his grasp of the big picture view, he
                                            could match any top commander. He was extremely clear on what he needed to
                                            do right now.</p>
                                        <p>A layer of black light covered the Overlord Bow, and in an instant, using the
                                            Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, Zhou Weiqing gathered a massive amount
                                            of Heavenly Energy and transformed it into the Darkness Attribute. At the
                                            same time, one of the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye on one the edges of the hexagon
                                            glowed brightly. Clearly, Zhou Weiqing was not using a mimicked skill,
                                            directly unleashing one of the Stored Skills of his Six Ultimate Godly Light
                                            Formation.</p>
                                        <p>A pitch black figure appeared silently above Zhou Weiqing’s head, hovering
                                            for a moment before spreading out and forming a humanoid figure with three
                                            sets of wings behind its back.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing gave another loud shout, his eyes actually
                                            turning a vast expanse of white. A strange aura burst forth from his body
                                            next, swarming up above his head and forming a small trail of silvery white
                                            mist, infusing into the pitch black figure of light above him.</p>
                                        <p>The silvery white mist seemed like the best fertilizer, and within an
                                            instant, the figure expanded to almost three times its original size,
                                            reaching a height of almost ten metres. The six wings behind its back spread
                                            out wide, and the figure seemed to become clearer, more focused and
                                            consolidated.</p>
                                        <p>The soldiers on the city wall found they were almost unable to breathe.
                                            Although the huge black illusory figure was not directed at them, they still
                                            felt the oppressive presence that was almost unbearable. Zhou Weiqing took a
                                            step forward, right over the city walls, actually hovering in midair. Above
                                            his head, the giant black illusory figure also did the same, and in that
                                            instant, its features were fully shown to all the soldiers on both sides,
                                            several tens of thousands of men.</p>
