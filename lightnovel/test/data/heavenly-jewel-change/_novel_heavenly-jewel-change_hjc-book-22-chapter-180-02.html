                                            together in a concentrated burst. That was exactly what Zhou Weiqing was
                                            doing now, gathering all the power into his right arm, to the ‘crying-face’
                                            Hammer in his right hand!</p>
                                        <p>Another massive explosion, and Gu Site’s entire body was savagely smashed
                                            into the ground without any suspense, with both his legs drilled right into
                                            the icy ground of the cavern. Although with his tough and powerful Heavenly
                                            Emperor Stage body, his arms and legs were not broken by Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            terrifying strength, the blood he had been forcing himself not to spit out
                                            previously finally came out. Zhou Weiqing landed right beside Gu Site, his
                                            hammers striking out at Gu Site’s head for the third time in an explosive
                                            strength. Taking on the impact of the previous hit was no issue for his
                                            powerful body in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state.</p>
                                        <p>Gu Site was extremely vexed! The reason why he was now in such a disadvantage
                                            was because he had severely misjudged Zhou Weiqing’s power, and that
                                            underestimation had led to him being surprised by him so many times.
                                            Growling angrily, he concentrated hard and the brilliant shimmer of the
                                            Divine Guardian Angel appeared around him, protecting his body.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, almost at the same time, another illusory figure appeared behind Zhou
                                            Weiqing. This time, it was the Demonic Dragon Lady.</p>
                                        <p><i>How many Skills with the Heavenly Skill Image does this brat have?! </i>The
                                            thought sprang up simultaneously in both the Lion and Tiger King.</p>
                                        <p>Still in shock, Gu Site had no time to be angry as he hurriedly circulated
                                            his Heavenly Energy to the maximum with his hands facing upwards, his entire
                                            body spinning in a whirlwind as powerful gold light sprang forth. The light
                                            soon turned into a massive gold tornado, fully enveloping his body.</p>
                                        <p>In Gu Site’s eyes, it was without question that Zhou Weiqing was once again
                                            using a Heavenly Skill Image to neutralize his Divine Guardian Angel Skill
                                            before his hammer with that terrifying strength landed once more. Having
                                            just used two powerful Skills, he was for a short time indisposed from using
                                            too much Heavenly Energy, and he had no choice but to now use his strongest
                                            Skill to defend himself.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, this time Gu Site had guessed wrongly. Zhou Weiqing had been striking
                                            down at him with such swift and fierce momentum, but the next moment he
                                            actually stopped in midair, his wings spreading apart and causing his body
                                            to hover right before he actually reached the Divine Guardian Angel barrier.
                                            In the short moment of time, the Heavenly Skill Image of the Demonic Dragon
                                            Lady had fully coalesced and his prepared Skill was ready to be used.</p>
                                        <p>As the purple red light glowed in the air, Xue AoTian couldn’t help but
                                            furrow his brow. How could the Lion King make such a ‘newbie’ mistake?</p>
                                        <p>Although Gu Site had told himself over and over that this young man in front
                                            of him was no ordinary six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, he was still a
                                            Heavenly Emperor stage powerhouse… how could he not have feelings of disdain
                                            and underestimate his opponent? Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing’s series of
                                            actions and abilities had truly gone beyond any of the present powerhouses’
                                            expectations and judgement. It had just been too shocking. Even Xue AoTian
                                            had been caught by surprise several times, let alone Gu Site. As such, the
                                            Lion King had not been able to bring his full power into play, falling into
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s rhythm and trap. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing had made use of
                                            this ‘Inertia of thinking’ that Gu Site had fallen into to spring this new
                                            trap.</p>
                                        <p>The purple red flash of light appeared within Zhou Weiqing’s formation, and
                                            his body did an about-turn in midair, as he retreated to the side to wait. A
                                            faint smile appeared on his face as he looked at the Lion King Gu Site. He
                                            was in no rush at all, and he could now afford to sit and wait for a
                                            while.</p>
                                        <p>The Divine Guardian Angel Skill had indeed come into effect, and this
                                            powerful Skill had an ‘Absolute’ effect as well. If Zhou Weiqing tried to
                                            use his Dragon Silencing Seal on Gu Site now, it would be totally wasted.
                                            However, though the Divine Guardian Angel Skill was indeed powerful, but
                                            just like the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation, it had its own set
                                            of limitations. In this case, the flaw was simple - when the user was within
                                            the Divine Guardian Angel Shield, he would not be able to move about, or
                                            unleash another Skill. This was the reason why Gu Site’s spinning body was
                                            unable to move, and could previously only circulate his Heavenly Energy into
                                            the gold whirlwind of light to protect himself.</p>
                                        <p>As a result, Zhou Weiqing could now wait calmly at the side. No matter how
                                            fast the Lion King could unleash his next Skill, it could not be faster than
                                            the Dragon Silencing Seal that Zhou Weiqing now had prepared to go at
                                            anytime. As for Clashing of Heavenly Skill Images, it had to be activated
                                            within a certain time limit of the Heavenly Skill Image being summoned; once
                                            it was fully coalesced, that was no longer possible.</p>
                                        <p>Due to that fact, normally a Clash of Heavenly Skill Images was done by a
                                            later Skill used to neutralized an earlier one. That was to say, Zhou
                                            Weiqing could have used his Heavenly Skill Image to neutralise the Divine
                                            Guardian Angel, but not the reverse.</p>
                                        <p>As such, Gu Site was now stuck using a powerful defensive Skill for nothing,
                                            as well as wasting his Heavenly Energy in the whirlwind of light, and was
                                            unable to do anything about Zhou Weiqing’s Dragon Silencing Seal.</p>
                                        <p>Calm, unhurried and confident. Those words could be used to describe Zhou
                                            Weiqing at this point. Who could have imagined that a mere Upper Level Zun
                                            Stage Heavenly Jewel Master could push a Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse
                                            to such a degree, even one so restricted like Gu Site had been!</p>
                                        <p>Abruptly, two bouts of purple-red light shot out from Zhou Weiqing’s eyes,
                                            before it flickered off once more. All of a sudden, the Divine Guardian
                                            Angel Skill around Gu Site vanished without warning.</p>
                                        <p>It was the Clash of Heavenly Skill Images! However, just as Gu Site was
                                            overjoyed, thinking that Zhou Weiqing had not been able to resist in using
                                            his Dragon Silencing Seal to neutralise his Divine Guardian Angel Skill… the
                                            next instant, a purple-red vortex appeared over his head. His Skills were
                                            suddenly all restricted!</p>
                                        <p><i>What … what the **** is going on?! </i>Once again, Zhou Weiqing’s actions
                                            were unreadable to the Lion King Gu Site. the Dragon Silencing Seal had
                                            clearly been used to Clash with his own Divine Guardian Angel Skill, yet…
                                            yet… how could it still come into effect?</p>
                                        <p>Let alone Gu Site, even the Tiger King Xue Aoying who had a bird’s eye view
                                            of everything going on was utterly confused. Of all the powerhouses present,
                                            only Long Shiya who was familiar with all of Zhou Weiqing’s Skill could
                                            fully understand what was going on. Even Xue AoTian could only vaguely guess
                                            what had happened.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian’s judgement was that Zhou Weiqing had somehow activated yet
                                            another hidden Heavenly Skill Image Skill, using that to neutralise the
                                            Divine Guardian Angel Skill before activating the Dragon Silencing Seal in
                                            the same instant.</p>
                                        <p>His judgement was indeed accurate. Zhou Weiqing had actually used the Demonic
                                            Dragon God Seal, also from the Demonic Dragon Lady, to neutralise the Divine
                                            Guardian Angel Skill. As the Heavenly Skill Image was also of the Demonic
                                            Dragon Lady, he was able to superimpose and disguise it perfectly. In truth,
                                            if he had attempted to actually use this Skill, it would be Zhou Weiqing
                                            himself asking for death. After all, not only was Gu Site far stronger than
                                            him, he also had the Spirit Attribute. The Demonic Dragon God Seal would not
                                            only have been useless, it would have probably been returned to damage
                                            himself. However, just like with the Time Reversal Skill, using it to
                                            neutralise the Divine Guardian Angel Skill was a whole different matter.
                                            Once again, another perfect timing and a worthwhile trade of a useless Skill
                                            to neutralise the Divine Guardian Angel Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing might not have much, but he definitely had tons of Skills. In
                                            fact, the powerful Heavenly Skill Image Skills he had were no lesser than
                                            most Heavenly King or Heavenly Emperor stage powerhouses. Six Attributes! He
                                            could pretty much go Skill Storing at will. In fact, even now, after
                                            reaching the fifth and sixth Jeweled stage, he still have many ‘empty slots’
                                            that he had not Stored Skills yet.</p>
                                        <p>The Absolute effect of the Dragon Silencing Seal had come into effect! That
                                            meant that within the next minute, the Lion King Gu Site was no longer able
                                            to summon his Consolidated Equipment or use his Stored Skills. Even if the
                                            former was already restricted, but the latter was a major blow indeed. So
                                            what if he was using Heavenly Energy of the eight-Jeweled stage? Facing a
                                            six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master with Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation,
                                            five God Tier Consolidated Equipment of a Legendary Set… what could he do?
                                            Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing still had the Dragon-Tiger Transformation!</p>
                                        <p>With a hearty laugh, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body pounced towards Gu Site like
                                            a bolt of lightning, the twin Hammers in his hands swirling eagerly. This
                                            time, he was not trying to last as long as he could, but was actually
                                            attempting to defeat the eight-Jeweled Lion King Gu Site!</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing leap at him, Gu Site suddenly understood. This fight,
                                            even if were his son with his full power, facing this six-Jeweled little
                                            brat, he might not even win.</p>
                                        <p><i>With no Stored Skills to use, restricted at the eight-Jeweled Heavenly
                                            Energy… am I really going to lose? </i></p>
                                        <p>Gu Site’s eyes suddenly turned calm and serene. Facing the pouncing Zhou
                                            Weiqing, his face turned expressionless, only lifting his right hand slowly
                                            towards to incoming youth.</p>
                                        <p>Ten yards. Zhou Weiqing was barely ten yards from Gu Site. With his charging
                                            speed, that was closed in barely a blink of an eye.</p>
                                        <p>Gu Site’s raised right hand had his palm outwards facing Zhou Weiqing, as if
                                            attempting to stall Zhou Weiqing’s attack. Yet, everyone around could see
                                            that he might block one attack, or even two, but without any Skills or
                                            Consolidated Equipment and with his Heavenly Energy restricted, how long
                                            could he last against that terrifying strength of Zhou Weiqing?</p>
                                        <p>A relieved and satisfied expression flickered across Long Shiya’s face, while
                                            a hidden flicker of happiness flashed in Xue AoTian’s eyes before it
                                            disappeared, hidden away. The Tiger King Xue Aoying also had a gleeful look
                                            on his face as he chuckled at the Lion King’s misfortune. However, in an
                                            instant, an abrupt change erupted.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to strike Gu Site, he suddenly saw the Lion
                                            King’s palm light up with a crimson red glow.</p>
                                        <p>In that moment, the Seal restricting Gu Site burst apart, and he resumed his
                                            Heavenly Emperor stage cultivation level.</p>
                                        <p>Smashing apart the Seal, releasing an attack. The entire process happened in
                                            a split second. Just as the expressions of the other three powerhouses
                                            froze, a resonant lion’s roar rang out as a huge gout of crimson flame
                                            swallowed Zhou Weiqing entirely.</p>
                                        <p>The flame connected right back to Gu Site’s palm, and the fire spouting out
                                            formed the image of a giant lion in midair. As the huge crimson lion formed,
                                            the temperature of the entire icy cavern rose abruptly. Besides a single leg
                                            that was outside the flames, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body was engulfed in the
                                            flames.</p>
                                        <p>“NOOOOO!!!!” Long Shiya howled in crazed rage. He no longer cared that it was
                                            a competition, and with a flicker of his arm, a terrifying Heavenly Energy
                                            smashed into Gu Yingbing, sending him flying. Another palm strike lashed out
                                            at Gu Yingbing while at the same time, his entire body pounced towards the
                                            Lion King Gu Site.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian was already by his side in a flash. Naturally, he would not allow
                                            his disciple to be killed like that, and he quickly blocked the enraged blow
                                            which would have finished Gu Yingbing off. However, he did not attempt to
                                            block Long Shiya from pouncing on Gu Site.</p>
                                        <p>A terrifying aura burst out from Long Shiya’s body, his entire ‘Hate Sky no
                                            Handle’ Legendary Set appearing all at once. The Silver octagon plum blossom
                                            Hammer still glowing with the dark gold light of being summoned, smashing
                                            down hard on Gu Site in a frenzy.</p>
                                        <p></p>
