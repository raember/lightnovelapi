                                            his own personal troop was full of killing intent, then the Peerless
                                            Battalion warriors were filled with confidence and vigor. Only a troop who
                                            had constantly won would have such a presence. Their aura was not piercing
                                            or forceful, but it was a stable confidence that spoke of absolute
                                            victory.</p>
                                        <p>“Is that troop yours… or does it belong to the ZhongTian Empire?” The smile
                                            on Ming Yu’s face disappeared, and he grew serious. Instead, as he asked
                                            that question, he actually used his Heavenly Energy to transfer his
                                            voice.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “With your Fei Li Empire’s intelligence
                                            gathering service, may I know if you have heard about the strange
                                            occurrences in this year’s ZhongTian Northwest border wars?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu nodded and said: “Although the ZhongTian Empire has tried their best
                                            to lock any news from spreading, but we have heard some bits and pieces from
                                            the captured prisoners of the WanShou Empire. Peerless Battalion right? A
                                            troop consisting of a mere few thousand, but they actually managed to assist
                                            the Northwest Armies in routing their enemies, which outnumbered them
                                            several times over. More so, they actually managed to cause severe
                                            casualties to the WanShou Empire, even alarming the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s smile widened even further, and he said one more line of words
                                            to Ming Yu using voice-transference, before turning back and heading to his
                                            own lines. This round of fighting was about to begin.</p>
                                        <p>When Ming Yu heard Zhou Weiqing’s words, he actually stood there for several
                                            more minutes, stunned into silence, before he had finally recovered himself.
                                            As he looked at the Peerless Battalion warriors opposite of him, there was
                                            something else new in his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s words to him were simple: “The Peerless Battalion was created
                                            by me, and is fully mine.”</p>
                                        <p>Just that simple line, it had already disclosed a large amount of information
                                            to Ming Yu. As for why Zhou Weiqing chose to tell him that, it was naturally
                                            not because he was the Fei Li God General, but because of his background of
                                            the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p>
                                        <p>He was about to begin the major undertaking of the revival of his Empire.
                                            Although he was confident in their success, he knew it was no easy task, and
                                            what he wanted was to gather and unite all possible powers he could. Since
                                            he had already had such relations with Little Witch, along with his Master’s
                                            promise, he was clear that there was now an undeniable link between him and
                                            the Heavenly Demon Sect. Furthermore, he did not hold any hate against the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect; in fact there was some goodwill. After all, after the
                                            past time when he had been attacked once, the Heavenly Demon Sect had never
                                            done so again, instead helping him out several times and even letting him
                                            peruse their secret Demonic Manual without any repayment.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, all Zhou Weiqing had was his Peerless Regiment. For the ZhongTian
                                            Empire not to stop him from taking the Peerless Regiment away, it was
                                            already a major support and giving him much face. He knew he could not
                                            expect any other material support besides their simple aid in contacting the
                                            Fei Li Empire. After all, that would be tantamount to declaring war on the
                                            Bai Da Empire. Although the Shangguan Brothers placed much importance on
                                            Zhou Weiqing, it was not so much that he could compare with an entire Large
                                            Empire now.</p>
                                        <p>As such, for Zhou Weiqing to revive his Empire from the yoke of the Kalise
                                            and Bai Da Empire occupation, he would have to face many trials and
                                            tribulations. As such, any bit of strength he could gather was of great
                                            importance.</p>
                                        <p>Today, all that he had done against the Fei Li Empire was not for fun, or
                                            that he was too bored and was looking for trouble. The main reason was of
                                            course to build up his Heavenly Bow Empire’s reputation and respect, but at
                                            the same time, a secondary reason was perhaps the hidden anger and need for
                                            vengeance against the Fei Li Empire who had been allies yet did not lift a
                                            hand to help them in the past. All of this was on the foundation of the
                                            support of the ZhongTian Empire.</p>
                                        <p>Towards Ming Yu, Zhou Weiqing had always had a good impression, and held some
                                            approval in his heart regarding him. It was not just because of the approval
                                            and acknowledgement that he showed previously, but because of their similar
                                            natures on the battlefield that had been displayed at that time. Since Ming
                                            Yu was from the Heavenly Demon Sect, who was to say that he could not aid
                                            the Heavenly Bow Empire in the future? As such, Zhou Weiqing did not hide
                                            anything from him, directly letting him know about his Peerless
                                            Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu drew a deep breath, looking at Zhou Weiqing who had long since
                                            returned to his lines. His mouth turned up in a faint smile, but no one
                                            could know what he was currently thinking about.</p>
                                        <p>After a moment of thought, Ming Yu shouted out. “Prepare for battle!”</p>
                                        <p>An orderly, almost synchronous, sound of armour clashing, and the seven
                                            hundred Ghost Demon Horse cavalry troops raised the spears in their hands, a
                                            soaring killing intent bursting forth as if a giant spear filled with blood
                                            was about to pierce into an enemy’s chest.</p>
                                        <p>On the VIP Stage, the watching group of Fei Li officials were secretly
                                            shocked. Most of them had only heard of the Fei Li God General by
                                            reputation, but it was their first time seeing him on a battlefield.
                                            Witnessing the terrifying presence of the Ghost Demon Horse cavalry with
                                            their own eyes, their confidence surged instantly towards this victory.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Wang stood by Cai Cai’s side, a complicated look in his eyes. All along,
                                            he had always considered his own Royal Family Cavalry to be the finest
                                            elites in the Empire. However, as he looked upon Ming Yu and his personal
                                            guard today, he finally understood that the difference between him and Ming
                                            Yu was just so huge.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of cultivation level, Ming Yu could not compare to him. However, in
                                            terms of leading troops, even a dozen of him could never compare to a single
                                            Ming Yu! No wonder Princess Cai Cai liked Ming Yu so much, not him! Who did
                                            not like a hero after all!</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Ming Yu had already drawn the long sword from the scabbard on
                                            his belt. Nudging his mount, the Ghost Demon Horse stepped forward three
                                            steps, and all seven hundred of his Ghost Demon Horse Cavalry behind him
                                            also did the same, in such an amazingly neat and orderly formation.</p>
                                        <p>*Boom**Boom**Boom* Three sounds of all the horse hooves striking the ground
                                            simultaneously, causing everyone’s heart to grip abruptly.</p>
                                        <p>These three steps were actually carefully planned. Firstly, Ming Yu was
                                            informing Zhou Weiqing that they were beginning their attack. Next, the
                                            three steps also instantaneously powered his personal guard’s aura and
                                            momentum to the max, and the killing intent grew suffocatingly.</p>
                                        <p>Facing Ming Yu, Zhou Weiqing dared not be careless. Solemnly, he shouted:
                                            “Enter formation” Behind his back, the Peerless Battalion warriors instantly
                                            entered the formation he had given the orders for previously.</p>
                                        <p>The First Main Company of the Peerless Regiment was truly their strongest
                                            elites, and every single one of them had impressive personal strength. At
                                            the same time, they had also worked the hardest in the training and
                                            cultivation. Although their formation and movements were definitely not as
                                            tidy and orderly as their opponents, their speed was no slower. In an
                                            instant, a long snakelike formation emerged on the drilling grounds, a
                                            formation that seemed like such a joke to the watching Fei Li officials.</p>
                                        <p>The snake like formation here referred to all seven hundred of them gathered
                                            in a line, just like the number ‘1’. <i>(TN: In case the description isn’t
                                                clear, it isn’t a single file towards the enemy, but a horizontal line
                                                with all of them facing the enemy)</i></p>
                                        <p>The greatest benefit of such a formation was its coverage and reach, but its
                                            flaws were just too obvious - being too thin and frail! With just a single
                                            layer of soldiers, what kind of frail formation was that? As long as anyone
                                            could charge and burst through any portion of it, the entire snake like
                                            formation would be pierced through and broken apart, unable to join up with
                                            each other. Even the newest, greenest commander on a battlefield would never
                                            use such a formation!</p>
                                        <p>As the Peerless Battalion warriors entered their formation, Ming Yu and his
                                            troop had begun their charge.</p>
                                        <p>Compared to the Peerless Battalion warriors, Ming Yu’s personal guard clearly
                                            displayed a whole different side. Their training in such matters had clearly
                                            far surpassed the Peerless Battalion soldiers, and as they charged, they
                                            maintained the same square formation neatly. However, after advancing around
                                            a hundred yards, the formation actually changed into a triangular formation;
                                            the entire process completed so smoothly without any hint of stalling or
                                            messing up.</p>
                                        <p>To change formations so easily in the midst of a charge, how much training
                                            did that require to accomplish that? More so, no matter the training given,
                                            only the finest elites would be able to do so. Ming Yu used his own actions
                                            to teach everyone present a lesson, to tell what was the meaning of ‘crack
                                            troops’.</p>
                                        <p>With Ming Yu’s experience in leading troops, the moment Zhou Weiqing used
                                            that snake-like formation, he instantly knew Zhou Weiqing’s goal. Very
                                            clearly, Zhou Weiqing had absolute confidence in the power of his own troops
                                            to be able to choose such a formation, and his goal was to counter-surround
                                            Ming Yu’s troops once both sides clashed, allowing the personal combat
                                            strength of his soldiers to come into play.</p>
                                        <p>The greatest confidence of Zhou Weiqing stemmed from the two hundred super
                                            Heavy Cavalry troops. Towards this point, Ming Yu was confident that he had
                                            read the situation clearly. Of course, with his vision, he could also tell
                                            how powerful those soldiers were. However, so what about that? This was a
                                            battlefield, a fight of seven hundred against seven hundred, not single
                                            combat. Ming Yu did not feel that just those two hundred soldiers alone
                                            could influence the result of the entire battle. He, too, had great
                                            confidence in his own personal guard.</p>
                                        <p>You want to use that snake-like formation to show off your soldier’s personal
                                            strength? Very well, I shall breakthrough by striking on a single point!</p>
                                        <p>A strange light flashed in Ming Yu’s eyes. Although he held much admiration
                                            for Zhou Weiqing, it was exactly because of that fact that he wanted to use
                                            all his power in this fight, to see how far this youth had grown.
                                            Powerhouses would always only respect other powerhouses.</p>
                                        <p>As both formations closed in on each other, the snake-like formation started
                                            to move just like Ming Yu had expected. Under Zhou Weiqing’s command, both
                                            ends of the formation doubled the speed of their charging towards both
                                            sides, while the center started to slow. Just like Ming Yu had guessed, Zhou
                                            Weiqing wanted to make use of the advantage of the snake-like formation to
                                            attempt to surround his personal guard.</p>
                                        <p>High up on the VIP Stage, Cai Cai subconsciously gripped her fists tightly.
                                            Her usual grace and poise was belied by the agitation in her eyes. Although
                                            this was not the first time she had seen Ming Yu on the battlefield, she
                                            still had that same excitement that set her heart on fire. Ming Yu’s command
                                            and direction in fighting just had such artistic appeal. She could almost
                                            envision his personal guards smashing through Zhou Weiqing’s warriors and
                                            gaining the victory, and Zhou Weiqing’s dejected look afterwards.</p>
                                        <p>Both sides were on the verge of an explosive clash.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Ming Yu’s triangle formation was less than fifty yards from the
                                            central lines of Peerless Battalion, a drastic change occurred.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu’s Ghost Demon Horse came to an abrupt halt, and his sword pointed to
                                            the right. In an instant, he had disappeared into the entire triangle
                                            formation that seemed to swallow him up. In the swift charge of the
                                            formation, they wheeled and turn to the right, arcing in a perfect small
                                            line towards the left flank of Zhou Weiqing’s formation.</p>
                                        <p></p>
