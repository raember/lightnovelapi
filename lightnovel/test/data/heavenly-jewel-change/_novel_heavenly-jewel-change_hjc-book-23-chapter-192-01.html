                                        <p>Without question, as he was facing Zhou Weiqing and his Peerless Battalion
                                            warriors, the Fei Li God General Ming Yu did not hold back at all, fully
                                            displaying the true power of his personal guard.</p>
                                        <p>Changing formations mid-charge several times, abrupt changes in directions as
                                            they neared the opponent, having their leading commander vanish into the
                                            formation. All of these control and command were already individually
                                            considered top level skills on the battlefield, let alone having them appear
                                            all at once. Although Ming Yu was only commanding seven hundred men, to be
                                            able to do so so smoothly and without any hint of messiness, he truly lived
                                            up to his name as the Fei Li God General.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Ming Yu’s strategy was also rather simple but effective. With a
                                            single look, he had determined that the backbone and core power of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s seven hundred men were the two hundred heavy cavalry soldiers in
                                            the center. However, due to their sheer weight, even if they were mounted
                                            upon Unicorn Heavenly Beasts, it was without a doubt that their speed would
                                            be somewhat restricted. Since these two hundred were the toughest to deal
                                            with, Ming Yu instantly decide to change his direction of attack.</p>
                                        <p>His goal was actually very simple, to create chaos, and this time he chose a
                                            single flank of Zhou Weiqing’s formation to cause it. As long as he could
                                            come crushing down with the irresistible might of his speedy charge onto the
                                            relatively weaker flank, then the Peerless Battalion formation would be
                                            thrown into chaos. Once that happened, with his elite troops and his own
                                            direction, he had absolute confidence of slowly finishing off Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            troops by chewing off bits and pieces</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, as Zhou Weiqing saw such movements and commands from Ming Yu, he
                                            couldn’t help but sigh in admiration. However, differing greatly from Ming
                                            Yu’s expectations, he was not panicked at all, instead giving a simple order
                                            - Charge!</p>
                                        <p>By now, the snake-like formation had already turned into somewhat of an arc,
                                            almost forming a pocket that was about to be filled up with Ming Yu’s
                                            triangle formation. However, in everyone else’s eyes, the ‘fabric’ of the
                                            pocket was just too thin, and the ‘sharp point’ of the triangle formation
                                            looked like it could easily tear a hole through this pocket at any time,
                                            with just a simple charge. Currently, the left side of the ‘pocket’ was just
                                            about to receive a massive blow from Ming Yu’s personal guards.</p>
                                        <p>Just as both sides were about to clash, all of a sudden, two figures sprang
                                            up and actually flew into the air. Instantly, two balls of different
                                            coloured light started glowing around their bodies. Without question, they
                                            were trying to unleash Skills. Generally speaking, on a battlefield,
                                            especially in a clash between large numbers, even if both sides had Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters, they would not use any high powered Skills in such a fashion.
                                            The reason for that was because, unless that particular Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master’s power had already reached a terrifying level, they would actually
                                            be in a highly disadvantageous stage. For example, any AOE Skills could
                                            accidentally harm their own side, even causing a drop in morale. After all,
                                            for a Skill to actually have use in such a large scale battlefield, it also
                                            meant that fine-grained control was most difficult. As both sides clashed,
                                            it was normally at close combat, and once that was so, any AOE Skills would
                                            definitely have a large chance of ‘friendly fire’.</p>
                                        <p>Besides that, if a Heavenly Jewel Master unleashed a large AOE Skill or any
                                            powerful Skill, it was without a doubt that he would immediately draw the
                                            attention of all enemies, becoming the main target. He would also come under
                                            fire of all the opposing side’s powerhouses. In such a large scale battle,
                                            even if the Heavenly Jewel Master was very powerful, who knew what a stray
                                            arrow or sword could do? As such, without special tactics or protection,
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters would never take the initiative to unleash such large
                                            scale powers, instead using their own Heavenly Energy to protect themselves
                                            while they fought and killed normally.</p>
                                        <p>Yet, these two who flew up into the air, they were actually attempting to
                                            unleash their Skills. Furthermore, by flying up in the air to do so, weren’t
                                            they making themselves an easy target?</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu’s personal guards were truly the finest amongst elites. Instantly,
                                            amongst the seven hundred of them, forty bouts of light shot out towards the
                                            flying duo. All of them were long ranged Skills! For a time, all the
                                            onlooking officials were totally stunned. Forty bouts of long ranged Skills…
                                            that meant in Ming Yu’s formation, there were at least forty Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters! Indeed, it was Heavenly Jewel Masters, not just Elemental Jewel
                                            Masters. The reason was because Elemental Jewel Masters would usually not
                                            become cavalry soldiers! For him to have over forty Heavenly Jewel Masters,
                                            how many Physical Jewel Masters would he have? At least a hundred estimated?
                                            For a moment, even Princess Cai Cai who perhaps knew Ming Yu the best was
                                            secretly shocked. She had not realised that the power that Ming Yu held had
                                            already grown to such heights.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, the two that had flown into the air was Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er.
                                            Currently, Zhou Weiqing was in his Dragon-Tiger Transformation State, and
                                            the large wings behind his back were unfurled and flapping gently. His right
                                            hand was wrapped gently around Tian’er’s slim waist, and looking at them, it
                                            did not seem like they were on a battlefield, looking more like a couple who
                                            were flying in the air enjoying the scenery. Towards the over forty incoming
                                            attacks, they totally ignored them, almost as if they had not seen the
                                            attacks.</p>
                                        <p>In a flash, the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation lit up below Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s feet, and in the next instant he lifted his right hand, causing a
                                            large patch of bluish purple light to cover the entire seven hundred
                                            personal guards charging at them. The most stunning thing was that the patch
                                            of bluish purple light also formed a triangle, and as it flew towards the
                                            charging personal guards, it landed perfectly on their formation, with not a
                                            single possibility of harming his own soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>This time, Zhou Weiqing was not just unleashing a Lightning Attribute Skill,
                                            but actually wielding lightning itself. His ‘Flying Lightning God Technique’
                                            was not just restricted to those lightning pearls, but even lightning in its
                                            raw form. Of course, those lightning pearls were much stronger, a more
                                            compressed version that held a stronger explosive power. Once he was able to
                                            bring them into play in massive numbers, even those with cultivation levels
                                            higher than Zhou Weiqing would not be able to take them easily. In
                                            comparison, raw lightning had the superiority in terms of pure speed.
                                            Furthermore, currently Zhou Weiqing was unleashing it in an area of effect,
                                            and there was almost no possibility of dodging it.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst Zhou Weiqing’s numerous Stored Skills, he had one called the Thousand
                                            Lightning Strikes, though it was not a very highly rated Skill. At this
                                            moment, Zhou Weiqing was actually using his Six Ultimate Godly Light
                                            Formation to mimic the Thousand Lightning Strikes at a far greater degree,
                                            and also with much finer control. In terms of control, who could compare
                                            with his teachings Long Shiya? That was the core specialty of the Six
                                            Ultimate Heavenly Emperor indeed.</p>
                                        <p>The most speechless thing about this attack was that this AOE lightning
                                            attack was not just an instantaneous one, but a continuous effect. If one
                                            looked closely, they would be able to clearly see that around the wings
                                            behind Zhou Weiqing’s back, there was a large whirlpool of faint bluish
                                            purple light, swarming into his body. As for the Six Ultimate Godly Light
                                            Formation at his feet, it was also fully glowing in that same bluish purple
                                            light. In such a state, Zhou Weiqing was almost using his own body as a
                                            conductor, drawing all the Lightning Attribute energy from the atmosphere
                                            and discharging it via his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. Such a
                                            constant and persistent AOE effect skill, it was truly terrifying
                                            indeed.</p>
                                        <p>This was only the beginning. Right beside Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er was not idle.
                                            Without knowing when, a strange looking staff had appeared in her hands,
                                            about one and a half metres long, fully white in colour, with a strange
                                            purple gemstone right on the top of the staff, almost as large as an average
                                            man’s head. However, that purple gemstone was now glowing with a brilliant
                                            gold light.</p>
                                        <p>Another AOE Skill, but the one that Tian’er was unleashing was even more
                                            brilliant and resplendent than Zhou Weiqing’s. A large area of gold light
                                            descended from the skies, landing on all the Peerless Battalion soldiers on
                                            the right flank, who were just about to clash with their opponents. In that
                                            moment, these soldiers enveloped in the gold light felt as if there was
                                            something burning in their bodies, filling them with strength and power.
                                            This included the Unicorn Heavenly Beasts below them, all of which were
                                            glowing with a layer of dim gold light. Their Heavenly Energy burst forth
                                            explosively, and in that moment, it was as if all of their strength had
                                            grown by at least twenty percent.</p>
                                        <p>On the battlefield, was was more terrifying than an AOE attack Skill? The
                                            answer was simple… an AOE support or boosting type Skill! Of course, the
                                            chances that such a Skill could appear on the battlefield was also like the
                                            hair of a phoenix and the horns of a qilin, nearly impossible! Although the
                                            Water Attribute had some healing effect Skills, they did not have any large
                                            scale boosting abilities. Only the Light Attribute and Life Attribute had
                                            some, but they were extremely rare and also very difficult to Skill Store,
                                            with only some of the rarest Heavenly Beasts having such Skills.
                                            Furthermore, most of the Light Attribute boosting Skills were in terms of
                                            defending against Darkness or increasing morale. As for the Life Attribute,
                                            it was not too bad, with large scale AOE heals. However, that was also only
                                            possible after the nine-Jeweled stage and with Heavenly Energy reaching the
                                            Heavenly Dao Energy stage.</p>
                                        <p>In Ming Yu’s long military career, he had seen a few AOE offensive Skills in
                                            his time, but this was truly the first time he had seen an AOE boost Skill!
                                            Furthermore, it was clear that this was no ordinary Light Attribute or Life
                                            Attribute Skill!</p>
                                        <p>This Skill that Tian’er had unleashed was called Angel’s Blessing, an AOE
                                            ‘Boosting’ type Skill, able to boost the stats of all living creatures by
                                            twenty percent within a certain area. The length of effect and exact
                                            strength of boost had a direct correlation with Tian’er’s personal strength.
                                            Besides healing, this was the true superiority of the Divine Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>The most frightening thing about such an AOE Boost Skill was not just that
                                            its effect was so strong, but its drain on Tian’er’s Heavenly Energy wasn’t
                                            too large. That was because Tian’er drew heavily upon the atmospheric Divine
                                            Energy, even priming some from solar energy. In such a case, she was just
                                            the inducing force, not the main source of the Divine Energy that was
                                            released, and thus it was only a minor drain on her own Heavenly Energy.
                                            However, such a Skill would also have an extremely long cooldown time before
                                            she could use it again.</p>
