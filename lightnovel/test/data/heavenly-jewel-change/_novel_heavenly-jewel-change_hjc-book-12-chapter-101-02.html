                                            deal with you myself… But what if it is the two of us against you?”</p>
                                        <p>She was not the type of person who was too stubborn and proud to accept help.
                                            If she knew she could not do it but continued to push through for nothing
                                            despite available help, then that would just be being stupid. Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            cultivation level might be still very low in comparison, but with his vast
                                            amount of high ranked skills and cunning ways of using them, with him
                                            supporting her by the side, Little Witch was confident of taking care of
                                            this opponent in front of them, who was only slightly edging her out in
                                            combat.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a whistling sound abruptly pierced the air, and almost
                                            at the same time as the sound started, an arrow arrived right in front of
                                            the young lady.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was barely thirty yards from her, and at such a close distance,
                                            the Overlord Bow’s bowstring barely sounded before the arrow had reached its
                                            target.</p>
                                        <p>When a Heavenly Jewel Master reached a certain cultivation level or power
                                            level, they had a certain sensitivity towards danger, otherwise she would
                                            not have sensed Zhou Weiqing so easily previously, before he had even pulled
                                            his bowstring.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing could clearly see that she seemed to just sway back and forth.
                                            Just a tiny motion. More accurately, that little movement was done before
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s arrow even left the bowstring.</p>
                                        <p>*Swoosh* The arrow barely missed her, almost barely grazing her skin as it
                                            shot across, but she did not even blink as it did so.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stared in shock, his mouth agape. It had to be known that he had
                                            locked on to her, perfectly confident in that arrow, and she had actually
                                            dodged it without using any Skills, unlike the BaoPo couple who had used
                                            their Time Attribute previously. If before today, anyone had told him that
                                            someone would be able to dodge his arrows at a distance of thirty yards, and
                                            just through physical means alone, Zhou Weiqing would definitely think that
                                            person was crazy. Yet, the evidence was right before his eyes, and he had no
                                            choice but to accept it.</p>
                                        <p>Dodging and blocking were two totally different things. If it was blocking,
                                            then Zhou Weiqing’s imbued Skills on the arrows would still take effect.
                                            However, if it were dodged, then those imbued skills would naturally lose
                                            their effect. In the distance beyond, a huge tree exploded as the arrow
                                            struck it.</p>
                                        <p>What sort of swift judgement, what sort of movement and speed did that
                                            require? Looking at her expression, it was clear that she had been very
                                            confident in dodging his arrow!</p>
                                        <p>Prior to this, Zhou Weiqing had always thought that among the six Physical
                                            Attributes, coordination and flexibility were the two most useless
                                            Attributes, especially in actual combat. After all, as their cultivation
                                            levels grew higher, everyone would be mostly using their powerful Heavenly
                                            Energy and Consolidated Equipment, as well as Stored Skills. Alas, now he
                                            knew that he was extremely wrong. There was no useless Attribute, only
                                            useless Heavenly Jewel Masters. Everything was all up to the user, and how
                                            he or she made use of what they had to the utmost. This female ZhongTian
                                            Battle Team member had just made use of the Coordination and Flexibility
                                            Attributes, along with her terrifying speed, to dodge the attack he had been
                                            so confident in.</p>
                                        <p>With a mocking, disdainful smirk, the young lady did not even look at Zhou
                                            Weiqing, instead looking at Little Witch as she said: “Looks like your
                                            companion isn’t too strong!”</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch giggled, glancing at Zhou Weiqing. At the same time, she thought
                                            to herself: <i>This Zhou Little Fatty will definitely be enraged to hear his
                                                power put down like that, to be looked down upon so disdainfully.</i>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>She was not wrong. Indeed, our dear Zhou Little Fatty was extremely angry,
                                            and the consequences were dire. For the archery skills that he was the most
                                            proud of to be dissed by his opponent, how could he stand there and take it
                                            so easily? [1. I translated the general meaning of it, as what he wrote was
                                            actually a ‘internet meme’ type saying. The literal meaning will not even
                                            make any sense =p Something like ‘It is something that I cannot stand, even
                                            if uncle can stand it, aunty cannot. That was a very very rough literal
                                            translation. I’m not sure how this ‘meme’ came about and did not have the
                                            time to research it sorry!]</p>
                                        <p>Wriggling the five fingers of his right hand, Zhou Weiqing suddenly took a
                                            massive breath. With a flick of his wrist, three arrows appeared from his
                                            Spatial Ring, pinned neatly between his fingers. In that moment, he seemed
                                            to enter an ethereal state of unearthly concentration. The tip of his foot
                                            struck the trunk of the tree in front of him lightly, using it as a pivot to
                                            send his entire body flying backwards. At the same time, the three arrows
                                            flew out; in the process, his five fingers danced through several
                                            complicated gestures, half twisting the bow string, plucking the bowstring,
                                            striking the arrows, etc etc and more.</p>
                                        <p>In the very instant that the three arrows flew out, another four followed
                                            suit one after the other. In total, seven arrows, each flying out in a
                                            different direction.</p>
                                        <p>This archery skill of his had a rather interesting name: Seven Stars
                                            Accompanying the Moon [2. Literal Translation, and also the reason for the
                                            title. This is actually a term that means good events will always accompany
                                            or encircle a great event.]</p>
                                        <p>This was actually an archery skill that Zhou Weiqing had created, bringing
                                            together all the styles he had learned as well as the unique powers that he
                                            had. Originally, when Mu En was teaching him everything he knew about
                                            archery, he had told him that in order to become a true Archer, he had to
                                            have something that was his own. If he only learned what his teachers
                                            offered him, his archery could be good, but would lack the last critical
                                            component, a true spirit within, and would only be a ‘dead thing’.</p>
                                        <p>Mu En was not the best teacher, nor was he the strongest, as he wasn't even a
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master. However, he was definitely a great teacher, a great
                                            guide for Zhou Weiqing. What he imparted to Zhou Weiqing was a direction, a
                                            line of thinking. This Seven Stars Accompanying the Moon Archery Skill had
                                            been slowly developed over the years, and it had only been after entering
                                            the Fei Li Military Academy that he had finally completed the Skill. Besides
                                            his own practice, he had never used it in actual combat yet. It was not that
                                            he did not want to do so in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, but it was just
                                            not too suitable for a arena style competition and the tournament format.
                                            Even now, he was still in the midst of slowly perfecting this Seven Stars
                                            Accompanying the Moon Archery Skill of his.</p>
                                        <p>As the seven arrows flew out, Zhou Weiqing sat back down onto the ground
                                            suddenly, the Overlord Bow in his hands vanishing. His face was pale and
                                            ashen, and he collapse down onto the ground, drained. Firing these seven
                                            arrows had actually depleted all of his Heavenly Energy, leaving him totally
                                            exhausted.</p>
                                        <p>The reason was simple. Among the seven arrows, each of them were imbued with
                                            his Stored Skills. Unleashing only seven Skills normally would not deplete
                                            his Heavenly Energy, but doing so at almost the same time almost caused him
                                            to lose control of the energy whirlpools of his body. If not for the fact
                                            that his physique was a lot stronger than any ordinary Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master’s, he might have inflicted self injuries just unleashing this
                                            Skill.</p>
                                        <p>*Swoosh* Zhou Weiqing did not even look at the battle field any longer,
                                            immediately releasing Da Huang and Er Huang from his Spatial Ring. Placing
                                            one hand each on their shoulders, he unleashed his Devour Skill in an
                                            attempt to quickly replenish his Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Anyway, they were not able to fight continuously by his side in this Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm, and just Devouring a bit of Heavenly Energy would not harm
                                            them, and they would quickly recover.</p>
                                        <p>Caught by Zhou Weiqing's Devour Skill, Da Huang and Er Huang revealed looks
                                            of panic and fear. However, they knew and trusted Zhou Weiqing implicitly,
                                            and did not resist his Devouring.</p>
                                        <p>Seven shrill shrieks pierced the air, almost at the same time, forming one
                                            loud long sound.</p>
                                        <p>The disdainful look of the female ZhongTian Battle Team member changed
                                            immediately, as she was astonished to find that of the seven arrows that
                                            shot out from behind the trees, none were actually headed towards her,
                                            instead shooting in various directions, causing her to be unable to make any
                                            accurate judgements.</p>
                                        <p>The unknown was usually the most scary, especially when it wasn’t in your own
                                            control. Looking at Little Witch warily, she extended her arms in
                                            preparation as she took a combat ready stance.</p>
                                        <p>Although Little Witch had not actually worked and fought with together with
                                            Zhou Weiqing before, she was extremely experienced in battle. At this point,
                                            she was not in a hurry. Smiling, she stood there on her position unmoving,
                                            instead raising her hands above her head, the blue tattoos around her body
                                            shining brightly again as the blue hibiscus behind her glowed brightly.
                                            Thick blue light seemed to gather around her short blade.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, Little Witch was biding her time, gathering power in order
                                            to unleash a powerful Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Such a Skill was undoubtedly terrifyingly powerful, but it also had a clear
                                            drawback. The charging time of it was just too long, and it would be easy to
                                            interrupt. Of course, this sort of Skill requiring a charge up time usually
                                            meant a correspondingly high strength and power.</p>
                                        <p>This was an extremely sneaky, but correct, action for Little Witch to take.
                                            If the female ZhongTian Battle Team member attacked her, she might leave
                                            herself open to Zhou Weiqing’s strange attack skill, letting it unleash its
                                            full potential. Yet, if she did not attack her, she would not be able to
                                            interrupt Little Witch’s charging, as she had to constantly be on the
                                            lookout for Zhou Weiqing’s ambush. More importantly, she did not know how or
                                            what Zhou Weiqing’s attack would do, and just standing there charging would
                                            not disrupt his. At the same time, she would be doing something useful,
                                            possibly giving her the chance to do a follow up or even finishing blow.
                                            This could be said to be an arrow killing several birds! An amazingly
                                            intelligent plan that could only force their opponent into a dilemma.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, the moment she started charging her Skill, the female ZhongTian
                                            Battle Team member’s expression changed, and she couldn’t help but hesitate
                                            a split second. At that very instance, Zhou Weiqing’s Seven Stars
                                            Accompanying the Moon arrows had almost reached her.</p>
                                        <p>The seven arrows all appeared almost at the same time in her senses.
                                            Surprisingly, all of them had a strange ‘wavering’ movement that somehow
                                            prevented her to fully lock onto them, and they each were glowing with a
                                            different colour.</p>
                                        <p>The weirdest thing was that the seven arrows were not flying fast at all.
                                            Compared to any normal shooting, they were considered slow, almost floating
                                            in the air.</p>
                                        <p>Soon, the arrows were barely ten yards from her, and in that moment, a cold
                                            light flashed in her eyes. She had already gotten a good estimation and
                                            judgement of the traveling path of all the arrows, or so she thought at
                                            least. At that point, she burst into explosive action, her body charging
                                            forward as she bobbed and weaved, her body swaying slightly in a strange
                                            rhythm as she attempted to charge through this ‘net’ of arrows.</p>
                                        <p>However… was her judgement truly accurate? Alas, this time, the answer was a
                                            big no. The seven arrows in midair actually changed directions almost
                                            simultaneously.</p>
                                        <p>The leading arrow seemed to slip to the side, just an almost imperceptible
                                            amount. As it did so, its tail feathers lightly brushed against the next
                                            arrow. This caused a chain reaction, and all seven arrows actually had their
                                            directions changed subtly!</p>
                                        <p>Such archery… Such skill… The only words that could come close to describing
                                            it would be breathtaking, almost impossible. Even Little Witch, who was in
                                            the midst of charging up her own Skill, couldn’t help but reveal a surprised
                                            look. In her heart, she knew that even if she took the place of the female
                                            ZhongTian Battle Team member, she would not fare any better.</p>
                                        <p>The Seven Stars Accompanying the Moon Archery Skill was an extremely powerful
                                            skill, actually drained all of Zhou Weiqing’s considerable Heavenly Energy
                                            in order to launch. He had slowly developed this skill over the course of
                                            the three years spent with the Heavenly Bow Unit and beyond, how could it be
                                            so easily broken like that?</p>
                                        <p>With the sudden unexpected change in speed and direction, it was almost
                                            impossible to for the female ZhongTian Battle Team member to dodge it
                                            anymore. Without a choice, she could only extend her claws, striking out
                                            swiftly to block the seven arrows.</p>
                                        <p>*Poof* The first arrow struck her God Tier Consolidated Claws, and was
                                            instantly destroyed by the powerful claws. The explosive effect of the
                                            Overlord Bow was totally useless, but surprisingly, the speedy, charging
                                            figure of the young lady was abruptly slowed, almost drastically.</p>
                                        <p>The Absolute Delay Skill had taken effect on her instantly.</p>
                                        <p>The invisible stress that this young lady had put on Zhou Weiqing was
                                            extremely huge, and he knew that if he wanted to suppress her, to allow his
                                            Seven Stars Accompanying the Moon Archery Skill and their corresponding
                                            imbued Skills to have their maximum effect, then he had to do so from the
                                            very start. As such, the first arrow to reach her would definitely have to
                                            be the Absolute Delay Skill, with its Absolute Effect.</p>
                                        <p>To any Heavenly Jewel Master powerhouse, judgement and control, of both
                                            themselves and their opponents, was equally important. The Absolute Delay
                                            not only slowed down her speed, but more importantly, it broke her rhythm
                                            and judgement.</p>
                                        <p></p>
