                                            constant. With sufficient draw, he was able to bind the Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers to him. Feelings and emotions had to be fostered, and at the same
                                            time, once these men got into a habit of listening to his orders, they would
                                            also gain feelings for this organization called the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Towards his own people, Zhou Weiqing was never a stingy person, perhaps even
                                            overly generous. With his soldiers training so hard, pushing themselves to
                                            the limit and beyond every day, he got Lin TianAo to get some doctors to
                                            prescribe some medicines to brew some nourishing and regenerative medicines,
                                            adding them to their usual food and drinks.</p>
                                        <p>In such a way, the Peerless Battalion soldiers were all nourished into tall,
                                            large, energetic fellows, and their improvement was at a tremendous pace
                                            indeed. In the end, even Shangguan Fei’er couldn’t bear to purposely
                                            withhold the pace of the medicines, and slowly from ten men, the quota was
                                            increased to twenty… thirty… and finally fifty.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, it was not just the increase in personal strength, even their
                                            equipment was improving by leaps and bounds. Yun Li and Little Miss Muddle
                                            were constantly churning out Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, and the custom
                                            made armour that Lin TianAo had ordered was also being completed and shipped
                                            in week after week. By now, the strongest of the Peerless Battalion were
                                            already all equipped with Spatial Objects. The entire Battalion grew in
                                            strength, their overall power going up through all aspects. Let alone the
                                            others, even the Heavenly Bow Unit masters were all secretly shocked by the
                                            sheer amount of improvement in the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>However, they were also clear this strength had not come without a cost, and
                                            the sheer amount of gold that had been sunk into building such an armed
                                            force was definitely an astronomical figure. Still, Zhou Weiqing had
                                            previously told them about how he had won a hundred million gold coins in
                                            the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, so they were not too surprised.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, as the time had passed, the hundred million gold coins that Zhou
                                            Weiqing had won was already pretty much spent. However, with the Spatial
                                            Sack of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, the value of the Heavenly Cores
                                            within were astronomical, and no matter how much they spent, he would not
                                            have any financial problems within the next ten years.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Time passed day after day, and before long, ,another three months had passed.
                                            The weather of the northern border also grew slightly warmer; no one would
                                            actually call it hot, but without question this was the best season of the
                                            north. Summer had come.</p>
                                        <p>With the arrival of summer, the peace of the northern border was now
                                            disrupted. The annual raids of the WanShou Empire was starting, as the
                                            weather was finally not too cold and more suitable for fighting, and their
                                            main goal was to gain enough food stores to get through the winter. As such,
                                            the start of the summer was the time for them to scout and harass the
                                            border.</p>
                                        <p>WanShou Empire. Swift Wolf Regiment Command Tent.</p>
                                        <p>A massive man about forty years of age was seated on the Commander’s seat,
                                            and there were eight others seated before him respectfully.</p>
                                        <p>*PENG* A loud clash, as the large and solid table was totally shattered by a
                                            blow from that massive commander’s palm. “Bastards! You useless bunch, what
                                            can you all do?! Do you mean to tell me that we sent out three Companies of
                                            men, and not only did we not gain anything, none of them actually
                                            returned?!”</p>
                                        <p>Butler was the Regiment Commander of the Swift Wolf Regiment, and he had ten
                                            thousand wolf cavalry soldiers under his command. To the WanShou Empire,
                                            this was already considered one of the more valuable elite units of the
                                            army.</p>
                                        <p>Ten thousand wolf cavalry troops, charging in a vast plains, that was an
                                            imposing sight that would even cloud the sky. With just his Regiment alone,
                                            he had once taken down an entire Legion of ZhongTian ordinary troops.</p>
                                        <p>In the Wolfman Tribe, Butler was the current Wolfman Tribe Leader, Bathuru’s
                                            eldest son, and was also the heir to the Tribe Leader position. Furthermore,
                                            he was a power Heavenly Jewel Master at the nine Jeweled stage. He could be
                                            considered one of the top elites amongst the younger generation in the
                                            WanShou Empire. On the left part of his chest, there was a white, triangle
                                            shaped insignia, showing that he had once ascended the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain, to undergo the baptism ceremony there as well as teachings.
                                            Towards any WanShou Empire soldier, that was an ultimate honour, and as a
                                            result, Butler was highly respected and had much status in the entire
                                            army.</p>
                                        <p>However, today Butler was extremely angry. In the last half a month, ,he had
                                            dispatched three Companies of his elite wolfman cavalry soldiers to the
                                            ZhongTian Empire border to scout and patrol. This was a customary annual
                                            tradition, yet this year, a very different result had occurred, as out of
                                            the three companies of Wolfman Cavalry soldiers, not a single one had lived
                                            to return.</p>
                                        <p>Such a situation had never happened before. After all, that was three hundred
                                            wolfman cavalry soldiers! Each and every wolfman cavalry was chosen from the
                                            elites amongst their tribesmen, rearing and teaching their war wolf mounts
                                            from a young age, before stepping onto the battlefield when they were adult.
                                            How could his heart not ache at such a huge loss? Ordinarily, just these
                                            three hundred wolfman cavalry soldiers would be enough to rout an enemy
                                            force of several Battalions of ordinary ZhongTian cavalry soldiers, let
                                            alone their infantry soldiers. As for the ZhongTian Heavy Cavalry, they
                                            would not be able to catch up to their speedy war wolf mounts to actually
                                            fight them. In terms of speed, the war wolves were afraid of no one.</p>
                                        <p>One of the Wolfmen on the left, slightly shorter but well built, spoke in a
                                            solemn tone: “Sir, how about we dispatch more troops to have a look. It
                                            looks like this year the ZhongTian Empire has prepared well for us. Our men
                                            must have met with an ambush from a large number of troops, otherwise they
                                            could not possibly have been totally wiped out, with not even a single one
                                            managing to escape to report back.”</p>
                                        <p>Butler gave a cold humph, before saying: “Send more men? How many do you plan
                                            to send?”</p>
                                        <p>The short wolfman said boldly: “Sir, I am willing to lead a Battalion of
                                            Wolfman Cavalry soldiers to slay all those ambushing enemies, to take
                                            revenge for our brothers.”</p>
                                        <p>“A Battalion? We have already lost three hundred men, are you trying to make
                                            me lose another Battalion? Since the ZhongTian Empire dared to take action
                                            against us, they naturally know how much we number. They must be seizing
                                            this opportunity that we always send a smaller number of troops at the start
                                            of the summer, and purposely set a trap to wait for us. Well, since they
                                            have set a trap for us, I’ll personally crush those traps and their
                                            ambushers. So… we will not do as they expect… sending just a mere Battalion,
                                            but our entire Legion. I do not believe that the ZhongTian Empire will
                                            actually send that huge an army to ambush us. Send out the orders, ask the
                                            Eagle Tribe brothers to help scout and see if they have constructed any
                                            fortifications on the borders or if there are any signs of overly large
                                            numbers of enemies. If not, we will set out in three days time.”</p>
                                        <p>“Sir, should we report it up the command structure first?” One of the other
                                            Wolfman Tribe commanders couldn’t help but ask.</p>
                                        <p>Butler said angrily: “Report up? Will reporting up let my three hundred
                                            brothers come back to life? As the humans say, sometimes a field commander
                                            has to decide against even the king’s orders. Let me first wipe out those
                                            humans who dare ambush us before we make our report. Alright, enough, you
                                            all go and prepare for the fight; we will wait for news from the Eagle Tribe
                                            before I make the final decision.”</p>
                                        <p>Although he was currently in a rage, he was still able to hold on to some
                                            reasoning, and would not just send troops out just like that. If an entire
                                            Legion was set as an ambushing party, he would not just strike out like
                                            that. However, if it wasn’t a large number of enemies, Butler had absolute
                                            confidence that his ten thousand strong wolf cavalry soldiers could sweep in
                                            and out of the border areas quickly, and take swift revenge upon those who
                                            had slain his three hundred tribesmen.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>At one side, Butler was in a rage, but on the other side of the border, Zhou
                                            Weiqing was extremely excited.</p>
                                        <p>By this time, it had already been a total of four months since he had
                                            separated from his teacher, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor. His training
                                            in the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts was also proceeding nicely, and
                                            he was getting much more skillful in it. It had to be said that Zhou Weiqing
                                            truly had talent in this area of controlling, and added to the fact that he
                                            had spent two years learning the fine control of archery, mastering the
                                            control of his own physical body, that had also helped in the matter. As
                                            such, though he was only starting on this Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation
                                            Arts, he already had some mastery of it. What followed next would just be
                                            continuous practice to mature in his understanding and usage of it.</p>
                                        <p>The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya had not returned to look for
                                            him, but Zhou Weiqing was not worried or urgent. After all, if Long Shiya
                                            did not know where his friend was currently at, to look for a person in the
                                            entire massive continent, that was no easy feat.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had just returned from the Seventh Legion Headquarters. He had
                                            just brought Shen Ji a large gift, three hundred wolfman tribesmen and war
                                            wolf corpses.</p>
                                        <p>After all, ever since Shen Ji had learned that Shangguan Fei’er and himself
                                            were from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and had it verified with Zhan
                                            LingTian, he treated the Peerless Battalion extremely well. As long as they
                                            had any requests, they were usually met, no matter food, equipment or other
                                            supplies necessary, even sending his own Seventh Legion men to escort the
                                            supplies to them to ensure their safety.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, the three Companies of Butler’s Swift Wolf Regiment had been taken
                                            down by the Peerless Battalion. Previously, the seven masters of the
                                            Heavenly Bow Unit had taken down an entire Company by themselves, let alone
                                            the current Peerless Battalion who had undergone almost half a year of
                                            intense training, and were all at an stimulated excitement, ready to test
                                            the fruits of their labour.</p>
                                        <p>When the three Companies of Wolf Cavalry soldiers met over a thousand archers
                                            with Consolidated Equipment Bows, their fates were already sealed. Before
                                            they had charged within a distance of three hundred yards, all of them had
                                            already died, with not a single survivor. As for the Peerless Battalion, it
                                            was without question that not a single one of them was injured, let alone
                                            dead. The true benefits of long ranged attacks was shown to their fullest
                                            potential here. Such a military achievement was of inestimable value to the
                                            confidence of the Peerless Battalion soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing had sent the combat spoils to the Seventh Legion, everyone
                                            was shocked. Those were three hundred wolf cavalry soldiers! To be able to
                                            slaw so many wolf cavalry soldiers was definitely a great merit of service,
                                            and to any Battalion Commander, it was already more than enough to grant him
                                            a rank of Vice Legion Commander.</p>
                                        <p>However, Zhou Weiqing declined any promotions that Shen Ji was offering,
                                            instead asking to change it into monetary rewards. In truth, Shen Ji was
                                            probably the only one who was not even surprised that the Peerless Battalion
                                            was able to slay so many Wolfman Cavalry soldiers. After all, in his eyes,
                                            Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er were from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.
                                            Though the Wolfman Cavalry soldiers were indeed powerful, they were no match
                                            for powerhouses from the Great Saint Lands. Furthermore, he had personally
                                            seen their power with his own eyes, and he did not have any suspicions about
                                            the truth about the killings.</p>
                                        <p>Besides the monetary reward, Zhou Weiqing also asked Shen Ji for another
                                            favour; that was that he hoped to incorporate the Ruffian Battalions from
                                            the other three Legions into his own  Ruffian Battalion. Although he already
                                            have one thousand five hundred men in his Peerless Battalion, it was still
                                            far from the number and power in his heart. He would rather not have any
                                            promotions, rank or prestige, preferring to bolster his numbers with more
                                            ruffians.</p>
                                        <p>The fact of the matter had already proven itself in his hands. The ruffian
                                            soldiers truly had a greater potential than most ordinary soldiers, just by
                                            virtue of the fact they were able to survive as ruffians. Furthermore, since
                                            they were exiled from all the various different sources in the respective
                                            Legions, it should not be a big problem taking in all those men.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji immediately agreed that he would send up the request on Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s behalf; after all he was only in charge of the Seventh Legion and
                                            did not have control of the other Ruffian Battalions, and could not
                                            guarantee success.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, to the Main Northern Army Command, those few Ruffian Battalions
                                            were nothing in their eyes, and giving those men to Zhou Weiqing was no big
                                            deal.</p>
