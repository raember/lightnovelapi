                                        <p>Those two hundred soldiers at the front, where were they from? Mounted upon
                                            the Unicorn Heavenly Beasts, their total height reached almost four metres
                                            tall? Were they actually human? Looking at those weapons… massive spiked
                                            maces, immense battle axes… were those really fully solid?! If so, how heavy
                                            were they!?</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai couldn’t help but feel a wrench in her heart, thinking to herself
                                            that the ZhongTian Empire’s support for Zhou Weiqing was beyond even her
                                            expectations! Were they even sending the most hidden treasure and finest
                                            elites along with Zhou Weiqing? Even after all these years, the Fei Li
                                            Empire had never even heard of the ZhongTian Empire having such an army
                                            unit!</p>
                                        <p>Very quickly, under the leadership of the gold clad general in front, the
                                            entire troop reached the front of the Fei Li City, stopping around thirty
                                            yards from Princess Cai Cai. The general halted his mount, and before anyone
                                            could see his actions, he had already dismounted in a flying motion. The
                                            flag in his hands actually flew back steadily, landing firmly in the hands
                                            of one of the four behind him, a large youth with a similarly massive
                                            stature. Just from that show of power alone, he had to be at least
                                            six-Jeweled or higher to be able to do so with such ease.</p>
                                        <p>The gold general took a few steps forward, removing the helmet from his head,
                                            revealing a honest and dignified, though young, face. He bowed slightly in
                                            respect towards Cai Cai before saying: “Heavenly Bow Empire, Peerless
                                            Regiment Commander Zhou Weiqing, leader of our diplomatic party here, greets
                                            Your Highness.”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, the Peerless Battalion had been officially renamed by Zhou Weiqing to
                                            a proper formation of Regiment. Since they were returning to the Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire, they did not need to restrict themselves as previously. Now that
                                            the Peerless Regiment numbered more than nine thousand men, it was no
                                            problem to call themselves a Regiment. Of course, their internal formation
                                            did not change, still using their Main Companies instead of Battalions.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing, a far-off look flashed in Cai Cai’s eyes as she
                                            almost slipped into a trance momentarily. It was only about two years since
                                            they had last met, and Zhou Weiqing had already grown and matured so much
                                            after leaving the Fei Li Empire. Without knowing why, in that instant, Cai
                                            Cai felt a strong sense of regret, regret that she had not been able to
                                            fight against all the opposition to do as she had wished in the past, to
                                            allow that youth to remain in the Fei Li Empire safely.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing, Cai Cai smiled and nodded, saying: “Regiment
                                            Commander Zhou, you’ve traveled far with your diplomatic party indeed. May I
                                            know if Princess Difuya is here as well?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Cai Cai’s question, Zhou Weiqing’s brow furrowed slightly. In truth,
                                            for Cai Cai to actually have such a grand welcoming ceremony, even involving
                                            the Royal Family Cavalry… that was something that was far beyond Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s expectations. After all, they were only a diplomatic party from a
                                            currently-dead Empire, but they were still given a welcoming of such high
                                            standards. However, as soon as Cai Cai spoke, he could instantly sense the
                                            superiority feeling of a large Empire. Both were princesses, but her tone
                                            was such that Princess Difuya was of much lower status than her.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Her Highness is currently resting in
                                            the horse carriage, Princess Cai Cai. How about we enter the City first
                                            before we chat more?”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai stared momentarily. She did not expect Zhou Weiqing to reply her like
                                            that. Today, she had personally come here to receive the Heavenly Bow Empire
                                            contingent with such high honours, and they had waited for such a long time.
                                            In her view, no matter what, Princess Difuya should personally come out to
                                            thank her. After all, even if it were the Kalise Emperor coming here
                                            personally, he would not get such a welcoming reception! Yet, looking at
                                            Zhou Weiqing, it seemed like he was not satisfied with this, even that
                                            Princess Difuya was not prepared to come out personally yet. This was
                                            tantamount to slapping her face!</p>
                                        <p>Of course, what Cai Cai did not know was that Zhou Weiqing’s thinking was
                                            just very simple. His entire purpose of having this diplomatic visit was to
                                            act ‘13’ [1. Literally 装十三, or 装13. Chinese internet slang where 13 looks
                                            like the english letter ‘B’ - equating to 装逼 (zhuang bi) which means acting
                                            cool/acting pretentious], or to show off their might.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing knew that with the support of the ZhongTian Empire, the Fei Li
                                            Empire would definitely support their Heavenly Bow Empire as well. However,
                                            the problem was that it was probably just a token support to ‘satisfy’ the
                                            ZhongTian Empire, not substantial at all. From how they had reacted after
                                            the Heavenly Bow Empire had been destroyed and the subsequent warrant issued
                                            for his own arrest after that… he could definitely tell that.</p>
                                        <p>As such, if he wanted to squeeze more benefits from the Fei Li Empire, he had
                                            to display the true strength and worth of the Heavenly Bow Empire, to let
                                            the Fei Li Empire feel that they could actually change the situation in the
                                            entire south… to be actually worth investing in and supporting. Only then
                                            would the support of the Fei Li Empire be truly sincere.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing was still very rich, he could not possibly just depend
                                            on that amount of money alone to totally fund the war in restoring his
                                            homeland. In the first place, the sheer amount required to fund such a war
                                            was astronomical; not only would he have to gather more troops, treat the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire citizens well… all of which would cost money. As such,
                                            this time not only was he here to ‘act cool’, but to do so up to a certain
                                            level, with style! With that said, this fellow was just here to show off the
                                            strength of his Peerless Battalion. No, wait, it should now be called the
                                            Peerless Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>Before Cai Cai could respond, an official beside her had already stepped
                                            forward, saying coldly: “Commander Zhou, our Princess has personally come to
                                            receive your Heavenly Bow Empire Princess Difuya, surely it doesn’t mean
                                            that Princess Difuya won’t even show her face to us? Could it be that after
                                            the Heavenly Bow Empire was destroyed, you all have even forgotten the most
                                            basic courtesy?”</p>
                                        <p>This official was a man who looked to be about forty years of age or so,
                                            dressed in a striking silver armour with some intricate gold tattoos making
                                            it seem a magnificent sight. Behind his back was an aquamarine green cape,
                                            billowing back in the wind as he spoke sharply.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s face instantly changed. “Princess Difuya might also be a
                                            Princess, but she is currently the only member of our Royal Family. She
                                            represents our Heavenly Bow Empire. Though we are working to ensure
                                            otherwise, if we are unable to rescue His Majesty in the future, Princess
                                            Difuya will become the new Queen of our Heavenly Bow Empire. The future
                                            Queen of our Empire is here, but your Empire has only sent a Princess here
                                            to receive her, so why should Her Highness come out to see you?”</p>
                                        <p>The entire contingent of Fei Li Empire  officials gathered behind Cai Cai had
                                            their jaws agape upon hearing those words. In their eyes, it was already so
                                            unbelievable that they would receive this Heavenly Bow Empire contingent
                                            with such high honours, yet this youth who didn’t even look to be twenty
                                            years old actually dared say that their welcome was not good enough. That
                                            was utterly unfathomable!</p>
                                        <p>In that instant, even Cai Cai’s expression turned ugly. Even asking herself,
                                            she felt that she treated Zhou Weiqing pretty well, but this little brat was
                                            acting up like this. If not for the fact that she was in front of so many
                                            people, she really felt like asking Zhou Weiqing: “Damn little brat, are you
                                            here just to cause trouble?”</p>
                                        <p>That officer who had walked out to scold Zhou Weiqing was totally stunned by
                                            his words. He had never expected Zhou Weiqing to reply so rudely and
                                            forcefully. His anger rose and he yelled in rage: “What is your Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire, a mere dead little Empire, let alone that Difuya isn’t Queen yet,
                                            even if she is, can she compare with our noble Princess? You still want our
                                            Emperor to receive her?” To be able to refrain from cursing, he was already
                                            showing considerable restraint.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at him coldly and said: “May I know who you are?”</p>
                                        <p>The general said proudly: “This general is the Fei Li Empire Royal Family
                                            Cavalry Troop Vice Commander, Shen Wang.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded towards him, then he lifted his hand along with the gold
                                            helmet he had taken off earlier. In a solemn tone, he said: “Vice Commander
                                            Shen, you have insulted my Empire. I challenge you to duel of mortal combat.
                                            Let us use our fresh blood to wash away that shame. Do you dare accept?”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Wang was enraged, and he was just about to speak, but was stopped by a
                                            single gesture from Cai Cai. Looking at Zhou Weiqing and his unreasonable
                                            yet unyielding look, she couldn’t control herself any longer. Lowering her
                                            voice, she said solemnly: “Zhou Weiqing, did you come here just to cause
                                            trouble?!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said coldly: “What do you mean I come here to cause trouble? If
                                            someone insults your Empire, shouldn’t you retort or fight back? There is no
                                            mediating this. If he does not accept my challenge, we will not enter the
                                            city… and you all can be responsible for your own actions. Although our
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire might currently be occupied by others, that does not
                                            mean we will allow anyone else to insult us.”</p>
                                        <p>“If you wish to fight, I am willing! Your Highness, please allow me to teach
                                            this young upstart who doesn’t know how high the sky is and how thick the
                                            earth is[2. Literal translation, basically means to not understand how the
                                            world works].” Shen Wang said angrily.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Princess Cai Cai was in a state like she didn’t know whether to
                                            laugh or cry. In the history of the entire Mainland, she was sure that there
                                            had never been any diplomatic visit that started off with a fight before
                                            they even entered the door. If they actually started fighting outside the
                                            city gates, what would the ordinary citizens think?!</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai glared at Zhou Weiqing and said angrily: “Fine, if you want to fight,
                                            so be it. We shall do so in the drilling ground, not at the front of the
                                            city gates. It will cause too much trouble and chaos here.”</p>
                                        <p>This time, Zhou Weiqing did not insist. Without hesitation, he agreed: “Very
                                            well, the drilling ground is fine. Principal Cai Cai has always treated me
                                            well in the past, such face I will definitely give.”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai glared at him again, as if saying <i>If you’re giving me face then
                                            why are you causing trouble here?!</i></p>
                                        <p>This disturbance resulted in the Heavenly Bow Empire contingent not even
                                            entering the Fei Li City, instead the whole group headed towards a drilling
                                            ground further out on the outskirts of the city.</p>
                                        <p>The Fei Li City was the capital of the entire Fei Li Empire, and its
                                            importance was without question. Not only was it the center of its political
                                            might, it was also the center of its economic might. As such, there were a
                                            large number of elite troops stationed all around the Fei Li City in
                                            encampments not far off, and there were drilling grounds beyond each of the
                                            city gates. Of them all, the one to the south was the largest, with the one
                                            at the east the just slightly behind.</p>
                                        <p>Escorted by the Royal Family Cavalry Troop, Cai Cai led the group of Fei Li
                                            officials while Zhou Weiqing led the Peerless Regiment soldiers directly
                                            towards the drilling ground. This was also because Cai Cai was at the head
                                            of this entire contingent, otherwise it would not have been possible. She
                                            had been given full power over how to treat this current diplomatic party,
                                            and in the end she could do as she pleased without anyone questioning her.
                                            The actual Commander of the Royal Family Cavalry Troop was usually stationed
                                            at the Palace to guard the Royal Family, and only the Vice Commander Shen
                                            Wang was here escorting her. In fact, he actually belonged to her faction
                                            politically.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai entered her own horse carriage, and Zhou Weiqing remounted his
                                            single-horned Ghost Demon Horse, moving alongside the carriage as they
                                            headed towards the drilling ground. All of a sudden, he heard Cai Cai’s
                                            voice in his ear.</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou Weiqing, what are you trying to do?” Cai Cai used her Heavenly Energy
                                            to do voice transference, not allowing anyone else to hear it.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s expression remained impassive, and he also said in
                                            voice-transference: “I’m not trying to do anything in particular… I am only
                                            trying to get the respect that my Empire deserves, is that wrong?”</p>
