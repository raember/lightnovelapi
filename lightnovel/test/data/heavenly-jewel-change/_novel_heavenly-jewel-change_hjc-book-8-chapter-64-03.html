                                            very clear that it was also because it was his ultimate defense just
                                            happened to be very effective against Zhou Weiqing. It could be said that
                                            they coincidentally were able to counter Zhou Weiqing’s powerful attacks and
                                            myriad of abilities. If not for that, facing Zhou Weiqing’s powerful
                                            attacks, strong control skills, and various capabilities, any normal
                                            Five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master might not be able to defeat this fellow.
                                            If Zhou Weiqing were also at the five-Jeweled cultivation level, Lin TianAo
                                            knew that he would no longer have the confidence in beating him, and even
                                            forcing a draw would be difficult. As his mind raced and he thought up to
                                            this point, he suddenly realised that perhaps Zhou Weiqing joining might not
                                            be such a bad thing after all. With his various abilities completing his
                                            own, that would be extremely great for their entire team.</p>
                                        <p>“Little brat, you’re just at the three-Jeweled cultivation level, and you
                                            even dare dream of trying to contend for a main team position? What a joke!”
                                            Before Lin TianAo could even open his mouth, Little Four had already spoken
                                            out mockingly.</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao did not try to stop Zhou Weiqing, instead looking coldly from the
                                            side. His understanding of Zhou Weiqing was also from hearsay, and he had
                                            not personally witnessed Zhou Weiqing’s power. Since he was willing to come
                                            forward, Ye Paopao was naturally happy to watch, especially since he was
                                            pretty angered by their attitudes as well.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked towards Little Four and gave him a big grin: “Does that
                                            mean, the spots are up for contention? How about you then, shall we try it?
                                            This place is large enough. If you lose, then we’ll swap our main team and
                                            substitute positions, how about that?”</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing said that, Little Four laughed, and even the large
                                            fellow whom Lin TianAo had called Drunken Bao, as well as Crow, both laughed
                                            as well. Both of them knew Little Four’s strength, furthermore it was a
                                            three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master fighting a four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master… in their eyes Zhou Weiqing was just being foolishly overconfident.
                                            However, Xiao Yan still remained impassive, while Lin TianAo furrowed his
                                            brow.</p>
                                        <p>With a quick flash, Little Four appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing, barely one
                                            chi from him as he said: “Little brat, if I lose, I will let you have my
                                            main team position. What about if you lose?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “If I lose, I will give you a set of
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls created by a Consolidating Equipment
                                            Grandmaster, how about that?” As he said that, he lifted his hand to his
                                            Spatial Necklace, and a wooden box appeared in his hands.</p>
                                        <p>Opening his box to reveal the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls within, Zhou
                                            Weiqing said: “This is a set of ninety nine Grandmaster Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls, called the Overlord Bow. It is created for Strength Type
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters, and although it is lacking one piece, the success
                                            rate is already very close to a hundred percent. Such a Consolidated
                                            Equipment which comes already with a socket is extremely rare, and I do not
                                            need to speak more about the value right.”</p>
                                        <p>Nobody had expected that Zhou Weiqing would place such a huge bet for just
                                            the place in the main team, especially since it was just a chance at it, and
                                            in their eyes, an extremely low chance. After all, such a set of Grandmaster
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls was at least five hundred thousand gold
                                            coins in the market, or perhaps even higher.</p>
                                        <p>Little Four turned to look at Lin TianAo, an inquiring look in his eyes.
                                            Although Zhou Weiqing’s Overlord Bow was no use to him personally, such a
                                            set could be very valuable, either selling for gold, or more importantly,
                                            being used to change for a set of Scrolls that he could use. As such, as
                                            soon as Zhou Weiqing took it out, his eyes glowed with joy. However, he
                                            highly respected Lin TianAo and did not directly agree.</p>
                                        <p>Although Lin TianAo did not understand why Zhou Weiqing want to do this, he
                                            could guess. Firstly, to gain status, and next was to become a main team
                                            member, and be able to actually join battles. Seeing Zhou Weiqing’s resolute
                                            gaze, as his Follower, what else could he do!</p>
                                        <p>“Since this Little Bro Zhou wants to have a fight, then you two can battle it
                                            out. Do not go all out, restrain yourselves. The bet will be as you both
                                            discussed.”</p>
                                        <p>As Lin TianAo said that, Little Four’s face brightened. In his eyes, the
                                            three-Jeweled Zhou Weiqing was just like an ant. For him to be able to
                                            represent the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy for such an important
                                            tournament, he had gone through many trials and tribulations, and fought his
                                            way through nearly all the other four-Jeweled power houses in order to get
                                            this spot. Little Four had the confidence that even if he were to face any
                                            ordinary five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, he would still be able to hold
                                            his own… let alone a three-Jeweled opponent.</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao said leisurely: “I bet… ten moves. Who’ll take it?”</p>
                                        <p>Xiao Yan glanced at him, and said passively: “Eight moves.”</p>
                                        <p>Crow pursed her lips and said: “Seniors, you have too little confidence in
                                            Little Four. I think five moves is more than enough.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing the three of them, Ye Paopao’s expression changed. These fellows
                                            truly looked down upon them… without question, they were betting on how many
                                            moves it would take for Little Four to beat Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>“I’ll bet with you all.” In that moment, a clear, enchanting voice rang out
                                            as Shangguan Bing’er stepped forth with an icy look on her face. Although
                                            she was usually gentle and kind, she could not back down when someone tried
                                            to bully her Little Fatty.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing watched on silently with his eyes narrowed, not at all worried,
                                            while Little Four gave a cold smirk.</p>
                                        <p>No matter who it was, looking at Shangguan Bing’er would definitely give a
                                            feeling of causing their eyes to brighten. Earlier, for the few of them
                                            besides Crow, most of their attention had been on Shangguan Bing’er. Perhaps
                                            there was a hint of wanting to show off to her when they had provoked Ye
                                            Paopao and Zhou Weiqing. Seeing Shangguan Bing’er step forward, the few of
                                            them couldn’t help but grin.</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao grinned and said: “Beauty, how are you going to bet with us? Why
                                            are you so protective towards this little brat, he couldn’t possibly be your
                                            boyfriend right?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s gaze did not waver as she said: “He is my fiance.”</p>
                                        <p>As soon as she said that, everyone at the other side started. From appearance
                                            alone, it was without question that Zhou Weiqing was definitely not a good
                                            match for Shangguan Bing’er, and they had never expected such an answer.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing felt a great sense of satisfaction as a smug look appeared on
                                            his face. This was the first time that Shangguan Bing’er had actually voiced
                                            such a thing out in public.</p>
                                        <p>“Ahhh, it’s really a beautiful fresh flower stuck in the you-know-what.[1.
                                            Basically, the idiom is flower stuck in shit, depicting a man together with
                                            a beauty he doesn’t deserve]” Drunken Bao said regretfully. Xiao Yan did not
                                            open his mouth, but the look in his eyes seemed rather weird. As for Crow,
                                            she looked rather puzzled, looking towards Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan
                                            Bing’er, as if examining how it could be possible between the two.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s voice was even colder, as if not having heard Drunken
                                            Bao’s words. “Three moves. I bet that in three moves, Little Fatty can beat
                                            your Little Four. However, my bet is really huge… do you all dare to accept
                                            the bet?”</p>
                                        <p>As soon as she said that, Drunken Bao and the others started. Although it
                                            seemed to them as if Shangguan Bing’er was talking nonsense, she definitely
                                            had an imposing air about her as she spoke, that confidence in her causing
                                            them to waver a little.</p>
                                        <p>Xiao Yan opened his mouth at last: “What do you want to bet?” His voice was
                                            deep and low, with a rather stunning feel.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er continued coldly: “If he does not beat Little Four in three
                                            moves, both of us will be willing to become your Lifetime Followers, with a
                                            lifetime Seal, and vice versa for the terms of the bet. Who is willing to
                                            accept the bet?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Shangguan Bing’er’s words, both Zhou Weiqing and Lin TianAo almost
                                            rolled their eyes. Zhou Weiqing had never expected that Shangguan Bing’er
                                            would actually learn from his actions just a few days ago.</p>
                                        <p>As for Lin TianAo, his thoughts were much more complicated. At first, he had
                                            felt that this beautiful girl who was always following Zhou Weiqing around
                                            was a gentle, innocent and naive girl, but now he felt that it was indeed
                                            true that ‘he that lies down with dogs must rise up with fleas’[2. The
                                            actual idiom is 近朱者赤近墨者黑, the actual translation being those who go near
                                            Vermilion/Cinnabar will become red, those who go near ink will turn black.
                                            Pretty much the same meaning.] They were using this same move again, and so
                                            righteously as well; her level was definitely higher than Zhou Weiqing’s! He
                                            did not feel like Shangguan Bing’er was taking any risk at all. After all,
                                            just a few days ago, didn’t the exact same thing happen to him when he
                                            thought he had a certain victory in his bag? Alas, the final result was
                                            clear. This husband and wife pair definitely wouldn’t do anything they
                                            didn’t have a firm grasp of. Lin TianAo was extremely clear about Little
                                            Four’s abilities, and although he was very powerful, he was still far from
                                            reaching Lin TianAo himself. If he himself could be tricked by Zhou Weiqing,
                                            how could Little Four possibly win?</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Lin TianAo did not attempt to remind his brother in arms. Not
                                            because he was an indifferent or uncaring person, but because he was already
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s Follower. No matter what, he had to put Zhou Weiqing’s gain
                                            at the forefront. To put it bluntly, he was no longer the Lin TianAo of the
                                            past, but the new him has a master now.</p>
                                        <p>“I will bet with you!” Before anyone else could open their mouths, Little
                                            Four had ran over urgently and yelled out. He had never expected that anyone
                                            would look down on him so much, let alone such a beauty. Three moves? She
                                            had actually said that little brat of only three-Jewels would take three
                                            moves to handle him? That was definitely an ultimate insult, and he could
                                            never stand for that!</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Shangguan Bing’er, Little Four said: “If I win, I don’t need that
                                            little brat, I just want you as my Follower.”</p>
                                        <p>“Hey, wait a minute! Little Four, you can’t do that. I was the one who came
                                            up with the bet first, if you get the beauty, why should I bother betting?
                                            Who wants that little brat!” Drunken Bao said with a dissatisfied look on
                                            his face. However, at that point, Ye Paopao and Zhou Weiqing who had been
                                            observing coldly at the side realised that both Crow and Xiao Yan were now
                                            keeping quiet, with nary a hint that they would join in.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er said passively: “Without considering the result of this
                                            battle, Little Fatty is a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master. Even
                                            though your cultivation levels might be higher than him, in the Jewel Master
                                            world, your status’ are far from his.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing the words Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, Drunken Bao’s
                                            eyes brightened. Everything else aside, this little brat was even younger
                                            than himself. Reaching such a Consolidating Equipment Master rank at such a
                                            young age, what would he be in the future? Perhaps even a Grandmaster
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master or better!</p>
                                        <p>If he could get such a Follower, that would be an immense gain!</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo sighed inwardly. He knew that at this moment, both Drunken Bao and
                                            Little Four had fallen into the trap. Just like he himself had been a few
                                            days ago, they were only looking at their possible gains, and not the hidden
                                            danger behind this enticing bet.</p>
