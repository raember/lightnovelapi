                                            myself.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji glared at her coldly: “Cannot restrain yourself? If you cannot
                                            restrain yourself, then you better step down from your position first. Later
                                            on, you return with me to the Legion headquarters… for now, let Shen Yi take
                                            over the Sixteenth Regiment temporarily.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu exclaimed in surprise: “Senior Brother, you… you are removing me from
                                            office?”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji continued coldly: “With your current psychological state, you are not
                                            suitable to be an officer in charge of an entire Battalion. Don’t you know
                                            that your actions could easily cost your subordinates lives… once internal
                                            conflict arises in the army, even I cannot bear such a penalty. In the
                                            entire army, this is the most dangerous thing, and the thing we fear the
                                            most. Who asked you to throw rubbish in their camp… now they have reason on
                                            their side, let alone they are from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, even if
                                            they aren’t, according to the army rules, I cannot punish them. Do you
                                            understand?”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu’s face was still filled with a wronged grievance as she said: “I do
                                            not understand, but [1. I translated this directly, but I think it makes
                                            more sense if she said ‘I do understand, but…’] his men were still drinking…
                                            are we going to ignore that?”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji said solemnly: “Looking at that Zhou Weiqing’s actions, it does not
                                            seem like he is bragging or exaggerating. Anyway, at that time, why did you
                                            tug on my sleeve?” At this point, only then did Shen Bu recall her original
                                            point and quickly described the entire scene about Green Wolf being close to
                                            death and being saved by Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Shen Bu’s description, Shen Ji sucked in a cold breath. “Are you
                                            absolutely sure? That man… when he used his Skill, there was such a
                                            light?”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu nodded and said: “I am very sure, it was just so miraculous that I
                                            could not possibly mistake it. In theory, although the Light Attribute has
                                            some healing properties, it is no match for the Life Attribute in terms of
                                            Healing Skills. However, that man just waved his hand, and that dying
                                            Company Leader of the Peerless Battalion instantly recovered, even his
                                            broken bones seemed to be fixed. It was truly a miracle. If that man is a
                                            top level powerhouse, then it is definitely possible that the Peerless
                                            Battalion could kill four thousand of the Swift Wolf Regiment… That was the
                                            reason why I tugged at your sleeve just now.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji’s expression changed several times as he thought things through for
                                            the next minute or so as Shen Bu watched him, but he did not make a
                                            sound.</p>
                                        <p>“Senior Brother, say something? Are we just going to let things go just like
                                            that?” Shen Bu asked questioningly.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji abruptly lifted up his head and said: “Let things go? Of course not.
                                            Come with me to see Master.” Shen Bu was immediately delighted. She knew
                                            that Shen Ji was their Master’s favourite, and as long as he spoke on her
                                            behalf, she would have a chance to take revenge.</p>
                                        <p>“Great! As long as Master is willing to help, so what if they come from the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace? We can still take care of them, especially that
                                            bastard Zhou Weiqing. Senior Brother, when that time comes, you must let me
                                            deal with him personally, otherwise I will not be able to vent my
                                            anger.”</p>
                                        <p>“Take care of him personally?” Shen Ji looked at her coldly. “If you really
                                            want to die, please do not implicate Master and myself, and your sister Shen
                                            Yi.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu looked at him in surprise before saying: “Senior Brother, what’s
                                            wrong?”</p>
                                        <p>“What’s wrong? Don’t you know what Skill that middle aged man used? To be
                                            able to produce that kind of result… that amount of recovery, and with the
                                            Heavenly Skill Image you described… There is only one possibility, often
                                            described as the most godlike, impossible Skill of the Light Attribute… that
                                            Skill is called the Adulation of Angels. For Zhou Weiqing to possess a Skill
                                            with the Heavenly Skill Image, I really do not know, but he is only at the
                                            Four-Jeweled cultivation stage, and I guess it should be some sort of
                                            trickery of sorts. However, that Adulation of Angels is a totally different
                                            matter. For that Skill, besides being unable to resurrect the dead, it is no
                                            weaker than any Life Attribute healing Skill, being able to cure even the
                                            most serious of injuries, as long as there is a single breath left in the
                                            person… that even includes poisoned wounds.”</p>
                                        <p>“To be able to unleash such a Skill so easily… not only does that require a
                                            cultivation level of Heavenly Dao Energy, he must be far within that stage
                                            as well, definitely a top level powerhouse. Do you know what kind of person
                                            you have provoked? That middle aged man that Zhou Weiqing calls Master is
                                            likely to be one of the Elders of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and one of
                                            high standing and importance. His cultivation level might not even be at the
                                            Heavenly King Stage… most likely at the Heavenly Emperor Stage. Even in the
                                            entire Heaven’s Expanse Palace, there aren’t that many Heavenly Emperors.
                                            How many heads do you think you have, that you dare offend a Heavenly
                                            Emperor stage powerhouse?”</p>
                                        <p>“I am bringing you back to Master to ask him to help act on your behalf, to
                                            bring you to apologize humbly and take responsibility, to ask for a lenient
                                            punishment. This time, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace has some actions they are
                                            taking.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Shen Ji’s analysis, Shen Bu felt a chill down her spine as sweat
                                            beaded around her forehead. She was totally stunned. As a Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master, she naturally knew what a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse entailed. Even
                                            if she was already at the six-Jeweled cultivation level, it could be said
                                            that a Heavenly Emperor was a legendary status to her. In the entire
                                            north-west army command, there was only a single Heavenly King Stage
                                            powerhouse, and even the entire North Armies of the ZhongTian Empire did not
                                            hold a single Heavenly Emperor! If Zhou Weiqing truly had such a Master, not
                                            only her being unable to offend them, even the entire Northern Army Command
                                            was unable to offend them! That was at the power level of the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace Palace Master!”</p>
                                        <p>“Senior Brother, I… I…” At this moment, Shen Bu was truly at a loss for
                                            words. Regret was not enough to fully describe her current feelings. Looking
                                            at her pale, ashen face, Shen Ji sighed and said: “There is no such thing as
                                            regret medicines, if you had known it would come to this, you would have
                                            acting differently… Still, you do not need to be too worried. After all, we
                                            are all allies and part of the same Empire. That Zhou Weiqing might have a
                                            strange disposition, but he has the overall big picture in mind. Otherwise,
                                            with such a powerful Master at his side, if he really wanted to slaughter
                                            all of you just now, no one could do anything about it. As long as we show
                                            sufficient sincerity in our apologies, the situation can still be redeemed.
                                            However, I’m afraid you will no longer be able to hold the position of the
                                            Sixteenth Battalion Battalion Commander, at least not for some time. Come on
                                            now, let us go see Master.”</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Back on the other side, Zhou Weiqing naturally did not know that Shen Ji and
                                            Shen Bu had been given a huge fright by the presence of Long Shiya. After a
                                            time of cheering and celebration, Zhou Weiqing gave the order for the
                                            Peerless Battalion to have three days of rest and recovery, to readjust
                                            themselves before resuming their training. At the same time, he announced
                                            that their training regiment would be increased.</p>
                                        <p>If that announcement had come before their time here, perhaps there would
                                            have been many complaints.</p>
                                        <p>However, after the previous fight and major victory against the Swift Wolf
                                            Regiment, coupled with what had happened this morning, the current Peerless
                                            Battalion was in extremely high spirits and morale, united together as one,
                                            actually proud of being part of the Peerless Battalion. Who did not wish to
                                            become stronger? Not just for themselves, but especially more so now that
                                            becoming stronger also had a clear set of further rewards in the Peerless
                                            Battalion. As a result, there was not a single voice of complaint towards
                                            the announcement, only a respectful acquiescence.</p>
                                        <p>As a Company Leader, Green Wolf was also punished by Zhou Weiqing, giving him
                                            forty lashes. The reason for the punishment was simple… who asked him to
                                            lose in a fight? Throwing the face of the Peerless Battalion!</p>
                                        <p>Green Wolf only felt lucky that he was being punished, as if it was some sort
                                            of blissful happiness. After being beaten forty times, that fellow had a
                                            smile on his face, an earnest sincere one to boot as he looked on at Zhou
                                            Weiqing, causing him to be afraid and suspicious that that fellow’s sexual
                                            orientation was extremely different.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>After everything was done, Long Shiya called Zhou Weiqing to his tent.
                                            “Little Fatty, come and tell teacher about your overall plan.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily. After all, when he first met Long Shiya and
                                            was taken under his wing as disciple, this teacher of his had said that he
                                            would have to accomplish everything himself, and he would give him any help.
                                            Yet, now he was interested in his plans?</p>
                                        <p>How could Long Shiya not be able to tell what Zhou Weiqing was thinking
                                            inside, and he said exasperatedly: “Just tell me when I ask you, as if your
                                            teacher will harm you? I was just thinking that your Peerless Battalion is
                                            really quite interesting… none of them are acting or anything, yet all of
                                            them are like ruffians. Still, that is not a bad thing, the thing I hate
                                            most are those pretentious people, like those Heaven’s Expanse Palace
                                            fellows. Of course, that old Heavenly Snow Mountain fellow is just as
                                            irritating.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily. How could he let go of such an opportunity; if
                                            he did so he wouldn’t be Zhou Weiqing! “Teacher, this is my plan ………” As
                                            such, he began to explain his plan towards Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>“...... Of course, plans are just plans, and changes will definitely occur
                                            along the way, and I will constantly adjust it according to what happens.
                                            Even so, I expect that within ten years, I will definitely have a troop of
                                            absolute elites, able to fight against any of the Bai Da Empire’s
                                            elites.”</p>
                                        <p>As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes gleamed brightly, getting more excited as he
                                            spoke about his plan.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his disciple, not even twenty years of age, speak in such detail of
                                            his plan, seeing how meticulous and deliberate it was, Long Shiya only had
                                            shock and amazement in his heart. It was clear that Zhou Weiqing’s talent
                                            was not just in his Heavenly Jewel Master talents. Perhaps, his plan was
                                            slightly optimistic and idealized, but without question his general view and
                                            big picture grasp was extremely impressive, and his creative imagination in
                                            doing things was also extremely surprising.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why Long Shiya held so much interest in the Peerless Battalion was
                                            not just because he found it so fun, but more so because he had personally
                                            witnessed how the Peerless Battalion had defeated the Swift Wolf Regiment
                                            the day before.</p>
                                        <p>When the Swift Wolf Regiment had appeared, Long Shiya had actually already
                                            reached the area, and he had been prepared to take action as soon as the
                                            Peerless Battalion was showing signs of losing. With his Heavenly Emperor
                                            stage power levels, perhaps he could not take down an army of hundred
                                            thousands or millions, but just a Regiment numbering ten thousand was not an
                                            impossible feat. Especially for Long Shiya, with his Six Attributes and the
                                            Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts allowing him to mimic and unleash so
                                            many Skills and without cooldown, it would not be too difficult to slaughter
                                            the Wolf Cavalry Soldier en masse. That was also the reason why Shen Ji and
                                            Shen Bu had placed the victory of the Peerless Battalion on the shoulders of
                                            Long Shiya, as a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse definitely had that
                                            capability.</p>
                                        <p>However, in the end, it had been Long Shiya and Duan Tianlang who had been
                                            the shocked ones as they watched the Peerless Battalion in action, not just
                                            their impressive power levels, but also their preparations, tactics and
                                            strategy.</p>
                                        <p>An entire Battalion of archers… that was definitely out of conventional
                                            logic. An entire troop without close combat capabilities and only ranged
                                            attacks, this sounded impossible. After all, what would happen if their
                                            enemies reached them, wouldn’t they be wiped out easily? Without close
                                            combat specialists to defend them, how much of their power could archers
                                            actually unleash?</p>
                                        <p></p>
