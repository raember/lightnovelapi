                                            completely different level compared to the past. As his Heavenly Energy had
                                            been transformed into Saint Energy, all of his techniques were activated via
                                            Saint Energy.</p>
                                        <p>The nucleus of every single Lightning Pearl was filled with dim,
                                            silvery-white light. When the thousands of Lightning Pearls exploded at the
                                            same time, they instantly tore the very air itself apart. Within that area
                                            of hundreds of meters, an enormous black hole appeared. Dimensional space
                                            itself had been obliterated by those thousands of exploding Lightning
                                            Pearls!</p>
                                        <p>Right! Zhou Weiqing had sensed someone following him and Bing’er early on. In
                                            fact, he had sensed this person as soon as he had left Heavenly Jewel
                                            Island. If it wasn’t for the fact that he had fused his Saint Energy and his
                                            Ice Cold Perception together, he never would’ve been able to discover those
                                            two hidden, faint auras. These two auras had followed from behind ever since
                                            he left Zhongtian City, and the faint murderous feelings emanating from them
                                            made Zhou Weiqing certain that they were not coming with good
                                            intentions. Thus, he had lured them here and then suddenly attacked.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing attacked, Shangguan Bing’er had drawn the Ghost Demon
                                            Horse into her ring. A pair of enormous wings appeared behind her back, and
                                            with a flick of her wings she instantly vanished. That way, she wouldn’t be
                                            hit by Zhou Weiqing’s terrifying Flying Lightning God technique.</p>
                                        <p>Two haggard-looking figures were blasted out of the area where the Flying
                                            Lightning God had just exploded. They immediately unleashed an awesome aura
                                            of destruction, preventing more of the terrifying explosive power from
                                            hitting them.</p>
                                        <p>Their bodies were emanating red-colored Heavenly Energy with the aura of the
                                            Destruction-attribute. Zhou Weiqing didn’t need to ask who they were; he
                                            knew they had to be powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell. He never would’ve
                                            thought that during the entire half year he had spent at Heavenly Jewel
                                            Island, the Blood Red Hell had kept people stationed at Zhongtian City the
                                            entire time. Without question, their goal was to kill him. And… Zhou Weiqing
                                            was able to sense their levels.</p>
                                        <p>Heavenly Kings! These two people secretly following him were Heavenly King
                                            powerhouses.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed. Even the powerful Dan Dun Battle Team of the Blood Red Hell with its
                                            two promising young eight-Jeweled Destruction-attribute powerhouses had been
                                            defeated by Zhou Weiqing.  If they wanted to be certain of killing him,
                                            their best chance lay in sending Heavenly King powerhouses.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, Zhou Weiqing had only sensed that the people following him from
                                            behind were not weak. He never would’ve imagined that the two were actually
                                            Heavenly Kings! Although they were only low level Heavenly Kings, they
                                            remained Heavenly King powerhouses! As he laughed bitterly to himself, he
                                            continued to press the assault.</p>
                                        <p>Heavenly Kings possessed the ability to fly. It wasn’t very realistic for him
                                            to try and escape them, as that would only result in death. Zhou Weiqing was
                                            different from the past! Although his set of Consolidated Equipment wasn’t
                                            complete, as a nine-Jeweled expert he was no longer the same Zhou Little
                                            Fatty who had been completely unable to resist Heavenly Kings at all.</p>
                                        <p>The Hate Ground No Handle equipment instantly appeared on his body. As the
                                            Flying Lightning God exploded, Zhou Weiqing didn’t pause at all in
                                            immediately charging towards one of the two Heavenly Kings of the Blood Red
                                            Hell.</p>
                                        <p>It had to be said that the two Heavenly King powerhouses looked to be in a
                                            sorry state. Holes had been blasted into their clothes by that terrifying
                                            explosion! Zhou Weiqing had simply moved too fast and had given them no
                                            warning at all, while the Flying Lightning God had been far more powerful
                                            than they had imagined. If it wasn’t for the fact that Heavenly King
                                            powerhouses were able to vaguely sense danger, causing them to immediately
                                            unleash their own Consolidated Equipment, they probably would’ve immediately
                                            suffered severe injuries.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, their situation was still grim. That explosive Lightning-attribute
                                            energy was causing wild havoc within their bodies, and the powerful numbing
                                            sensation caused their movements to be slowed. What astonished them the most
                                            was that their Destruction-attribute energy was actually unable to withstand
                                            the surging Lightning energy. How could they not be stunned by this?</p>
                                        <p>The twisting light almost instantly shone upon one of the Heavenly King
                                            powerhouses. Zhou Weiqing’s Blink skill was unleashed in a seamless, perfect
                                            fashion.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly King powerhouse felt his entire body tense up as though
                                            everything around him seemed to slow down, while Zhou Weiqing’s Dual
                                            Legendary Hammers came smashing down directly at his head.</p>
                                        <p>Absolute Delay! Now that it was being used by Saint Energy, it was even more
                                            powerful than Zhou Weiqing could imagine. Even a Heavenly King powerhouse
                                            had no immunity whatsoever against his Absolute Delay. The Heavenly King
                                            powerhouse was only able to struggle to lift up his arms, using the
                                            longsword in his hand to block against Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Hammers.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, right at this moment, he saw Zhou Weiqing’s eyes shoot out twin beams
                                            of purple-red light. The strange thing was, Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Legendary
                                            Hammers had also instantly turned purple-red in color!</p>
                                        <p>This had all happened without any warning. A beam of purple-red light
                                            suddenly shot out of the Crying-face Hammer in Zhou Weiqing’s left hand,
                                            shining down upon the Heavenly King. Under the effects of Absolute Delay,
                                            the Heavenly King had no chance to dodge at all. His Consolidated Equipment
                                            suddenly and silently vanished, and so he now had nothing he could use
                                            against Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Hammers. Faced with tremendous danger, all he
                                            could do was to cross his arms and sluggishly attempt to defend against the
                                            oncoming strike.</p>
                                        <p>BOOM! He let out a miserable scream as his arms were instantly torn apart
                                            into bloody bits of flesh by Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Hammers. He still only had
                                            five pieces of the Hate Earth No Handle, which meant that they only
                                            multiplied his power by thirty-two times, but it must be remembered that
                                            Zhou Weiqing was now at the nine-Jeweled level. In other words, it was a
                                            nine-Jeweled level of power which was multiplied. This was thirty-two times
                                            the power of a nine-Jeweled Strength-type Physical Jewel, not the original
                                            six-Jeweled level. What did this mean? It meant that even a Heavenly King
                                            powerhouse who had lost his equipment and had to face this head-on would
                                            suffer miserably!</p>
                                        <p>The Dual Hammers had destroyed his arms, then delivered a vicious blow to the
                                            Heavenly King’s chest. His body was smashed into the ground, caving in the
                                            dirt beneath him. The Heavenly King spat out a mouthful of blood. Although
                                            he was still alive for now thanks to his mighty power, Zhou Weiqing’s strike
                                            had thoroughly and heavily wounded him.</p>
                                        <p>Even Zhou Weiqing himself was stunned by this, to say nothing of this
                                            Heavenly King. He never would’ve imagined that a Heavenly King powerhouse
                                            would crumple like paper before his strikes. Even if his attack was very
                                            powerful and very sudden, his opponent was still a Heavenly King! How was it
                                            that his foe had folded so easily before his strikes?</p>
                                        <p>Right at this moment, a terrifying ripple of power coming from behind him
                                            caused him to feel a sense of shock. Not hesitating at all, Zhou Weiqing
                                            spun in midair as he spun his Dual Hammers, a dense stream of silver light
                                            that forming a ‘shield’ behind him.</p>
                                        <p>A loud explosion rang out. The sudden attack had actually been blocked by his
                                            shield of silver light! The powerful stab had sent sparks flying everywhere,
                                            but it was unable to breach the shield which Zhou Weiqing had Consolidated
                                            using Spatial Rend technique. The attacker was the second Heavenly King
                                            powerhouse!</p>
                                        <p>When the second Heavenly King had seen as his comrade was heavily injured by
                                            a single blow from Zhou Weiqing, he had immediately felt a sense of
                                            amazement. He wasn’t even able to see or understand how Zhou Weiqing had
                                            done this!</p>
                                        <p>Two streaks of azure light suddenly shot out from the skies above, sweeping
                                            downwards. It was a pair of enormous wings, and it was like an azure tornado
                                            had suddenly swept across the Heavenly King.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing lifted up his Dual Hammers, shooting out yet another streak of
                                            purple-red light. Just now, he had used the same beam of light to dispose of
                                            the first Heavenly King. He was going to use the same technique again. What
                                            was it? It was the Dragon Silencing Seal, which had been used without first
                                            accumulating power at all!</p>
                                        <p>The dazzling purple-red light flashed and then vanished almost instantly. The
                                            Heavenly King had just lifted up his longstaff to block the descending
                                            attack from Shangguan Bing’er, but all of a sudden he realized that his
                                            Consolidated Equipment had melted away.</p>
                                        <p>However, he still had a few pieces of equipment left which he had used before
                                            the purple-red light had arrived. An enormous illusion of a turtle instantly
                                            formed behind him, glowing with thick red light that was intermixed with
                                            terrifying Destruction-attribute energy which formed a barrier of light
                                            which knocked away the attack from Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>However, in the next moment his technique vanished alongside the rest of his
                                            Consolidated Equipment. Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Hammers had instantly appeared
                                            before him as well!</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly King finally understood why his comrade had been heavily wounded
                                            by Zhou Weiqing. This youth who they were targeting was able to instantly
                                            employ techniques without needing to build up power first. Worse, his
                                            techniques were vastly more powerful than they had
                                            imagined. Nine-Jeweled? How could he be nine-Jeweled?! Wasn’t this target
                                            supposed to be just six-Jeweled?</p>
                                        <p>Alas, there was no time for him to ponder these questions. In fact, he was
                                            given no chance to do anything at all. His entire body stiffened as
                                            countless streams of light simultaneously shot down upon him, and in that
                                            instant he discovered that they had transformed into a powerful binding
                                            force which immediately began to crush away at every single part of his
                                            body. He was a Heavenly King powerhouse, but he was actually unable to
                                            unleash any attacks at all!</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er was able to see everything perfectly. Zhou Weiqing’s Dual
                                            Legendary Hammers had been used in conjunction with the Fetters of Wind,
                                            Absolute Delay, and Touch of Darkness. These techniques fell upon the
                                            Heavenly King in succession, causing it so that even the arms he wanted to
                                            use to defend against Zhou Weiqing immediately froze in position.</p>
                                        <p>However, Heavenly King powerhouses were still Heavenly King powerhouses. The
                                            Heavenly King’s movements had been completely restricted and the Dual
                                            Legendary Hammers were crashing down towards his head, but Zhou Weiqing
                                            suddenly saw the man’s eyes become filled with a berserk aura of
                                            Destruction-energy.</p>
                                        <p>“Not good.” He once more used his Blink skill, no longer caring about
                                            attacking this opponent. Zhou Weiqing instantly reappeared next to Shangguan
                                            Bing’er. He pulled her into his arms, then unfurled the wings of his
                                            Dragon-Tiger Transformation behind him to completely protect Shangguan
                                            Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>Just as he finished doing this, a surge of power filled with madness and
                                            Destruction-attribute energy suddenly exploded behind him. The Heavenly King
                                            from the Blood Red Hell instantly transformed to become a terrifying blood
                                            red color, then exploded in terrifying fashion. A ball of red fire exploded
                                            forth from his Dantian, then flew straight towards Zhou Weiqing’s back.</p>
                                        <p>He had actually managed to break free from the bindings of the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal. This was because he had actually chosen to self-detonate,
                                            blowing up his Heavenly Core Nucleus! This was definitely the most powerful
                                            strike a Heavenly King powerhouse could unleash, and the aura of this strike
                                            was such that there was no way Zhou Weiqing could flee from it with
                                            Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly King of the Blood Red Hell who had chosen to self-detonate his
                                            Core Nucleus had an insane look in his eyes. He had no choice but to do
                                            this. His comrade was clearly incapable of fighting any further, while he
                                            himself was unable to block Zhou Weiqing’s bizarre attacks. Rather than let
                                            Zhou Weiqing kill him, he would rather fight to the very end. The Blood Red
                                            Hell had a secret technique that could allow someone to survive even a
                                            self-detonation of a Heavenly Core Nucleus, but it would take him ten years
                                            in order to slowly rebuild his body again. This was an agonizing price to
                                            pay, but it was much better than being killed.</p>
                                        <p>When Heavenly Jewel Masters fought, they would generally try to end the
                                            battles quickly even if they were stronger than their foes. Unless you were
                                            significantly more powerful, if your foe managed to seize the initiative
                                            with his techniques he could end up killing you in a short period of
                                            time. Thus, he chose to immediately use a suicide attack to try and kill his
                                            foe.</p>
                                        <p>His flaming red Heavenly Core Nucleus smashed directly into Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            back, causing terrifying Destruction flames to instantly erupt and cover
                                            both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er, who was protected within his twin
                                            wings.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Heavenly King of the Blood Red Hell, he collapsed to the ground,
                                            his entire body covered with countless bleeding wounds. The giant bloody
                                            hole in his Dantian was the most terrifying of all. All he was able to do
                                            was to just barely use the final scraps of his Heavenly Energy to try and
                                            seal his blood vessels.  At the Heavenly King level, if you didn’t instantly
                                            die then you could have a chance to survive even if you lost all of your
                                            blood.</p>
                                        <p>However… his movements suddenly froze as a golden light appeared before him,
                                            filled with an aura of sharpness.</p>
