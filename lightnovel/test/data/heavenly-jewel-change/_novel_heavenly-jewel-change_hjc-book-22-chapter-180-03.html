                                            cultivation level, even a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse would evaporate
                                            from such an attack, an instant death indeed. It was no easy feat to summon
                                            the Earth Spirit Heart Flame, even for Gu Site. Not only was it a massive
                                            drain, it would seriously damage his life force and vitality.</p>
                                        <p>No matter what calculations and expectations Long Shiya had, he had never
                                            imagined that Gu Site would actually break the rules of the competition just
                                            like that, resuming his Heavenly Emperor Stage cultivation level and using
                                            his Personal Core Flame to destroy Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>When Gu Site had realised he had been tricked, the fury in his heart was
                                            burning to an unbelievable point. He had always had a hot temper, and with
                                            the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion blood burning hot within him, in his
                                            sheer rage he had lost control. Who was he? He was the King of the WanShou
                                            Empire, a noble Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse! To be forced to such a
                                            stage by a mere brat of six-Jewels, to even lose to such a person, how could
                                            he stand it?!</p>
                                        <p>As the saying goes, ‘Anger rises from the heart, and evil will then rise from
                                            the gall bladder’[1. A clumsy literal translation! Basically it means that
                                            when one is enraged, he can do anything/people can do sudden rash things in
                                            a fit of anger, things they would not do otherwise with a clear mind] Gu
                                            Site instantly made the decision not to let Zhou Weiqing leave this place
                                            alive, even if he had to fall out with Long Shiya. There were three
                                            powerhouses here on the side, including himself, and if the Entropic Nether
                                            Tiger was willing to help out, they might even be able to kill Long Shiya as
                                            well. As such, he had flung caution to the wind and launched his attack. He
                                            had been confident that Xue AoTian would not sit back and watch Long Shiya
                                            kill Gu Yingbing.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion King’s estimations had all been correct, but he had missed one
                                            point. That was… he was still stuck in the Absolute effect of the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal, and he now had to withstand the crazed fury of Long Shiya in
                                            that state.</p>
                                        <p>*BOOM* A single hammer blow. The Lion King’s body was sent flying by Long
                                            Shiya like a cannonball shot from a cannon, smashing savagely into the
                                            mountain. The next moment, a bout of light followed suit into the freshly
                                            opened hole. Gu Site had actually been smashed by the hammer right through
                                            the Heavenly Snow Mountain and back outside! This time, even if he did not
                                            die, he would definitely be severely injured.</p>
                                        <p>“Show mercy!” At this point, the Tiger King Xue Aoying had no choice but to
                                            intervene. Although he did not like the Lion King, and did not get along
                                            well with him, he could not just sit back and watch the King of the WanShou
                                            Empire get slaughtered by the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor!</p>
                                        <p>“Get lost.” By now, Long Shiya did not care about anything or anyone else.
                                            The brilliance behind his back forming his own figure, almost making it seem
                                            like own body had grown huger. The light around the octagon plum blossom
                                            Hammer brightened a hundredfold as it whistled brazenly towards the Tiger
                                            King.</p>
                                        <p>Xue Aoying’s expression changed. Although he was able to use his own Skills
                                            and Consolidated Equipment, he dared not take such a furious blow from Long
                                            Shiya! Immediately, his body moved aside.</p>
                                        <p>“Bro Long, calm down. Zhou Weiqing is not dead.” At last, Xue AoTian
                                            appeared, using his own body to block the fresh new hole, a snow white long
                                            spear in his hands. Behind his own back, a similar glow of his own illusory
                                            figure flashed. With a flick of his spear, he blocked Long Shiya’s hammer,
                                            and the entire cavern seemed to groan slightly in the massive impact.
                                            Originally, the exit which housed the large number of Heavenly Beasts had
                                            constant sounds of heavy breathing, but it was instantly silenced. After
                                            these Heavenly Beasts sensed the sheer aura and power of the two powerhouses
                                            clashing, they did not even dare let any sense of their presence be
                                            felt.</p>
                                        <p>In a direct clash of physical strength, even Xue AoTian would not dare to do
                                            so against Long Shiya with his entire ‘Hate Sky no Handle’ Legendary Set. As
                                            such, he could only subtly parry the blow as best he could.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Long Shiya heard Xue AoTian’s words clearly, his anger diminished.
                                            Subconsciously, his head snapped to where his precious disciple had
                                            been.</p>
                                        <p>The next moment, Long Shiya was dumbfounded, staring dazedly as he
                                            stopped.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had not been devoured by the  Earth Spirit Heart Flame like he
                                            had thought, and he was just standing right there. His entire set of
                                            Consolidated Equipment had all disappeared, but he seemed totally unharmed.
                                            The only embarrassing thing was that he was now totally naked, standing
                                            right there in his birthday suit in a rather ridiculous sight that even Zhou
                                            Weiqing himself was stunned by. Luckily, his entire skin was still covered
                                            by the purple scales, so it still wasn’t too obvious. The certain ‘object’
                                            between his legs was swinging slightly, and if one looked closer they would
                                            be able to see it.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya almost slapped himself silly. Indeed, how could he have
                                            forgotten!</p>
                                        <p>No matter how powerful that Earth Spirit Heart Flame was, how could it be of
                                            any effect to his disciple? After absorbing the Solidified Dragon Spirit,
                                            Zhou Weiqing was pretty much immune to fire.</p>
                                        <p>The Earth Spirit Heart Flame was the Personal Core Fire of the Heavenly
                                            Divine Earth Spirit Lions, and under the restriction of not being able to
                                            use his Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills, this was the strongest
                                            attack that Gu Site could use. Alas for the poor Lion King, his attack was
                                            fully of the Fire Attribute. Although that terrifying attack has caused Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s entire Legendary Set to dissipate, his body remained unharmed.</p>
                                        <p>In a flash, Long Shiya appeared beside Zhou Weiqing, examining his precious
                                            disciple up and down, even that ‘certain object’ got a glance. Only after he
                                            was certain that Zhou Weiqing was totally alright did he heave a sigh of
                                            relief.</p>
                                        <p>However, despite the fact that Zhou Weiqing was fine, that did not mean the
                                            Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor’s rage was assuaged. He spun around abruptly,
                                            turning his gaze to Xue AoTian. His eyes were cold, but he did not say
                                            anything. Pulling Zhou Weiqing’s hands, he said solemnly: “Let’s go, Little
                                            Fatty.”</p>
                                        <p>“Bro Long, wait a minute. I will give you a reckoning on this matter.” Even
                                            for Xue AoTian, seeing Long Shiya like this caused him some anxiety. He knew
                                            that if he allowed Long Shiya to leave like this, there would be severe
                                            repercussions. In fact, let alone Long Shiya, currently Xue AoTian’s heart
                                            was filled with rage. He had never imagined that the Lion King Gu Site would
                                            actually disregard his own pride and status to do something so shameless as
                                            to attack Zhou Weiqing with full power. If Zhou Weiqing truly died, Long
                                            Shiya aside, Xue AoTian would not let Gu Site go so easily.</p>
                                        <p>“Aoying, go bring the Lion King back here.” Xue AoTian said gravely. His
                                            expression was already extremely ugly.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya took a deep breath, suppressing the rage in his heart. After all,
                                            this was still the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and they still had not achieved
                                            their original goal in coming here.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said softly: “Master, I am fine.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya glared at him and said exasperatedly: “Just because you gained a
                                            slight advantage, you thought you could press it? Did you forget who your
                                            opponent was?!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a helpless look. He had also been given a huge fright, not
                                            having expected that the Lion King would actually go all out on him. In that
                                            instant, there had been zero chance for him to dodge the blow. Although Long
                                            Shiya did not spell it out, Zhou Weiqing knew that his Master was reminding
                                            him that if Gu Site had not used a Fire Attribute attack, perhaps he would
                                            be dead now.</p>
                                        <p>However, was that really the truth of the matter? At that moment, Zhou
                                            Weiqing did not try to explain himself to Long Shiya; after all, his Master
                                            was not wrong to lecture him. In truth, when he had sensed the Lion King’s
                                            attack, in the last split second Zhou Weiqing had managed to react and
                                            release a Skill. With that unique Skill, even if the Lion King was not using
                                            a Fire Attribute attack, Zhou Weiqing still had some confidence that he
                                            could at least survive it, if barely.</p>
                                        <p>Before long, the Tiger King had brought the Lion King back.</p>
                                        <p>Gu Site’s current look was truly miserable and desolate. His right hand hung
                                            limp at his side, looking like the bones within had been totally shattered.
                                            Even if he could keep the arm, it was not going to be a simple matter to
                                            heal it.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, his chest area had clearly sunk in, and his face was ashen.
                                            Blood seeped out of all his seven orifices, and his eyes were clearly dim.
                                            From just one look, it was clear that Gu Site was severely injured.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya had previously thought that he had killed Zhou Weiqing, and in his
                                            rage, he had struck out with all his might, supported by his entire ‘Hate
                                            Sky no Handle’ LEgendary Set. The Lion King had originally been weaker than
                                            Long Shiya, let alone without any of his Consolidated Equipment. Being able
                                            to stay alive was already a testament to how powerful his body and
                                            cultivation was.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the Lion King once more, Long Shiya’s eyes were filled with a violent
                                            killing intent. Raising the hammer in his hands, he said coldly: “Gu Site,
                                            you bastard. We are now mortal enemies, I swear I will kill you. You don’t
                                            want your face anymore? You even dare bully a mere junior. Just you wait,
                                            this old man will ensure that your entire Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion
                                            Tribe is wiped out.”</p>
                                        <p>“Bro Long, please calm down. Allow me to handle this matter.” Xue AoTian’s
                                            face was stern as he spoke.</p>
                                        <p>Gu Site did not react to either of their words, instead staring dazedly at
                                            Zhou Weiqing. He could not believe that Zhou Weiqing was still alive, even
                                            unharmed, after taking a head-on blow of his  Earth Spirit Heart Flame. Yet,
                                            there he was standing there, wearing his clothes!</p>
                                        <p><i>How could this be!? Why is this happening? </i>Zhou Weiqing had given him
                                            just too many shocks today. Was that brat really six-Jewels? Gu Site’s heart
                                            was filled with questions.</p>
                                        <p>Gu Yingbing remained uninjured, as Xue AoTian had received the blow that Long
                                            Shiya had struck at him. He quickly rushed to his father’s side, and rays of
                                            healing Divine energy shone upon his father’s body. However, his head
                                            remained bowed down, and he did not dare look at Zhou Weiqing, as his face
                                            was filled with shame. He was still young, not as experienced and vicious as
                                            his father. Having such a thing happen had diminished his strong fighting
                                            spirit.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian looked at the Lion King coldly and gave a cold humph. “You have
                                            thrown away the face of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. There is no longer any
                                            need to continue with the competition. You can go now, and tell all the
                                            guests that the wedding is cancelled.”</p>
                                        <p>“Ahh?” Only then did Gu Site react, his face darkening as he said: “Mountain
                                            Lord, I admit that I have made a grave mistake. We have indeed lost this
                                            second test, but… isn’t there still a third test?”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian said coldly: “You still have the face to mention a third test?
                                            What is your status, your power? Have you gone stupid being the King of the
                                            WanShou Empire? How old is Zhou Weiqing? What did I tell you previously? I
                                            said. You can get lost now. Yingbing will no longer inherit my Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain Lord position. Yingbing, you escort your father back. In a month, I
                                            want to hear that you have assumed his position as King of the WanShou
                                            Empire. Otherwise, don’t blame me for taking care of it myself.”</p>
                                        <p>Enforcing his will strictly and swiftly. That was truly the way to describe
                                            Xue AoTian. In a matter of moments, he had already made his choice and
                                            judgement. He did not even give Gu Yingbing a third chance. Not because of
                                            Long Shiya’s threats, but because of his own face, and the honour and
                                            dignity of the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
