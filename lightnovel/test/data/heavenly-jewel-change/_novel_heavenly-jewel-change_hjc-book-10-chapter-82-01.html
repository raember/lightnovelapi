                                            Zhou Weiqing knew that his own character was rather contrasting to that,
                                            much more radical. That had its advantages, but also its disadvantages as
                                            well. Someone like him would benefit greatly from having someone stable like
                                            Lin TianAo around as his companion, with both complementing each other to
                                            amplify each other and allow them to display their talents to the
                                            maximum.</p>
                                        <p>Both Lin TianAo and Zhou Weiqing were direct speakers, and he did not try to
                                            beat around the bush.</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, is there something wrong with Lady Bing’er? Did something
                                            happen?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Lin TianAo’s question, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but be surprised:
                                            “How did you know?”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo furrowed his brow, saying: “Since we left the Fei Li City,
                                            although you have trained, you were never that diligent. Yet, these few
                                            days, you have been going through closed door training non-stop, not eating
                                            and drinking for several days. Although we might not have been together for
                                            long, I think I do understand your character pretty well. Added to the fact
                                            that Lady Bing’er has gone missing, besides the fact that something has gone
                                            wrong, I cannot think of another reason why you would suddenly become so
                                            diligent.”</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, no matter as your Follower, your leader, or your friend, since
                                            something has happened to Lady Bing’er, why did you not tell us all? The
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament might be important, but both you are Lady Bing’er
                                            are our companions. If she is in trouble, we will definitely help as best we
                                            can. In fact, if we didn’t bump into that Shangguan Xue’er who looks exactly
                                            like her, I would almost have thought you came up with that story of her
                                            being related to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile and said: “It’s not that I do not want to
                                            say, but in truth no one else can help in this matter, and I can only depend
                                            on my own strength. To be honest, up to now, I still cannot believe what
                                            happened, it feels so unreal. She really does come from the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace, and is part of the triplet sisters. The problem is, her father is
                                            called Shangguan Tianyue, and he is the Second Palace Master of the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace, at least at the Heavenly King Stage or perhaps even
                                            higher.”</p>
                                        <p>“You heard it for yourself that day when Shangguan Xue’er came looking for
                                            me, unless I can defeat her, I can never be together with Bing’er. That
                                            Shangguan Xue’er is possibly the heir to the entire Heaven’s Expanse Palace,
                                            and she already has such a powerful cultivation level at Seven Jewels,
                                            possibly also with the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye, and with God Tier Legendary
                                            Sets. To defeat her… how could it possibly be an easy task? I am only two,
                                            almost three, years younger than her… Every time I’m improving… so is she as
                                            well…”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo gave a faint smile and said: “Weiqing, you should not belittle
                                            yourself like that. In truth, I have felt that in terms of talent, you have
                                            the most potential out of anyone I have ever seen or heard of in my life.
                                            Even comparing with the five Great Saint Lands, I am certain that no one is
                                            stronger in that respect. Do not forget that we do not come from those Great
                                            Saint Lands, perhaps not even from large Heavenly Jewel Master clans. Those
                                            from direct lineage in the Great Saint Lands like Shangguan Xue’er, from a
                                            very young age, powerful Jewel Masters will help them cleanse their marrow,
                                            meridians and body, giving them a huge advantage. From the age of three,
                                            they are taught how to cultivate with the top arts, and they usually Awaken
                                            their Heavenly Jewels by the age of six to seven.”</p>
                                        <p>“With such a head start, in addition to various secret medicines, top arts,
                                            their speed of cultivation is naturally extremely fast. Furthermore, they do
                                            not have to worry about Skill Storing, Consolidated Equipment, as that will
                                            be prepared by their elders. With even their cultivation route and direction
                                            planned for them, how could they not be much faster than any ordinary
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters. That’s the reason why they are at such a high level
                                            of six, seven Jewels even below twenty years old. Both that Little Witch and
                                            Shangguan Xue’er are similar in that.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yet, for us, it is very different. We are from ordinary backgrounds, almost
                                            commoners in comparison. Our Heavenly Jewel Awakening has an element of luck
                                            within, and to be able to start cultivating at ten years old is already
                                            considered very good. While cultivating, we still have to worry about Skill
                                            Storing and Consolidating Equipment; at the same time, our training arts are
                                            likely lower level than theirs. It can be said that, for us to reach our
                                            current state, it was through much struggle, blood and sweat that we have
                                            earned on our own.”</p>
                                        <p>“You are not even seventeen years old this year, and you have already reached
                                            a three-Jeweled cultivation level. To an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master
                                            without any powerful background, that is already considered unbelievable. I
                                            definitely believe that when you reach my age, your power will definitely be
                                            far above mine.”</p>
                                        <p>“Our way of cultivation is definitely a lot slower when compared to those
                                            privileged, but it isn’t without its benefits. After all, we have gone
                                            through much suffering and toil, working hard to gain our power. Sometimes,
                                            the process is equally important as the result, and we have a stronger
                                            foundation due to that; treasuring every Skill and Consolidated Equipment we
                                            have. At the same time, our battle experience and combat skill is usually
                                            more varied and abundant.”</p>
                                        <p>“Simply put, if I met any member of a privileged Clan, as long as our
                                            cultivation level isn’t too far apart and he doesn’t have more than two
                                            Attributes, I have the confidence in beating him. Fighting spirit and
                                            willpower isn’t something so easy to foster, not even with the best training
                                            conditions.”</p>
                                        <p>“Furthermore, I have noticed that your cultivation speed is truly
                                            unbelievably quick. It has barely been long since your last level up, and
                                            yet your Heavenly Energy is close to reaching the next level again. Added to
                                            that, you have that unheard of Elemental Jewel, an Alexandrite Cat’s Eye
                                            Jewel with THAT many attributes… I truly believe that you will be able to
                                            defeat Shangguan Xue’er in the near future… perhaps even being able to
                                            defeat her with a lower cultivation level.”</p>
                                        <p>Speaking up to that point, Lin TianAo finally paused. The strong confidence
                                            in his words definitely influenced Zhou Weiqing. Although he had not shown
                                            it, he had been feeling despondent, and lacking in confidence, but Lin
                                            TianAo’s words had sparked a fire within him once more. Once again, Zhou
                                            Weiqing felt a sense of joy that he had been so lucky to have him as a
                                            Follower.</p>
                                        <p>Looking seriously at Zhou Weiqing, Lin TianAo continued: “However, Weiqing,
                                            you must remember that everything needs to be done step by step in the
                                            proper process. This is especially so for cultivation, you must not rush
                                            into things and be too hasty, or you might end up in trouble with a
                                            cultivation deviation [1. I believe I had this same problem previously, but
                                            I can’t remember what I used for this! If anyone does, please do remind me
                                            in the comments! <a
                                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zou_huo_ru_mo_%28medicine%29"
                                                    target="_blank">走火入魔</a> ]. In that case, everything you have worked
                                            so hard for will go up in smoke just like that, and you will never ever see
                                            your Bing’er again. Do you understand?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing understood clearly in his heart that Lin TianAo was telling him
                                            this because he was afraid that he would be overdoing the training and get
                                            into trouble, and wanted to remind him.</p>
                                        <p>He was an only child in his family, and in that moment, looking at Lin
                                            TianAo, Zhou Weiqing felt as though he was looking at an older brother.
                                            Nodding his head repeatedly, he agreed.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that his words had taken effect, Lin TianAo stood up, patting Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s shoulder and saying: “You are an intelligent person, and very
                                            spirited and creative. I dare say you are the most talented person. This is
                                            not some mindless praise or flattery. I know I do not need to say more, you
                                            should understand what I mean. Cultivation and training is extremely
                                            important, but the process is very important. Do not be reckless.”</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, work hard, I am rooting for you. You are born with the inner
                                            charisma of a leader, and with your strategies and charisma, you are good at
                                            influencing the people around you. Even I am no exception. If your plan for
                                            this Heavenly Jewel Tournament works out as per your expectations, and we
                                            actually succeed, then when we return, you will definitely have raised a
                                            whole new level in many different ways. In the future, when you graduate
                                            from the Fei Li Military Academy, you will definitely become a great leader
                                            and general, and yield brilliant results in the military field.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying all that, Lin TianAo patted Zhou Weiqing hard on the shoulder
                                            once more before leaving the room.</p>
                                        <p>After closing the door, Zhou Weiqing was not able to calm down for a while.
                                            Suddenly, he muttered to himself: “Tian’er, thank you. If not for your
                                            reassurance that time, I would have missed on the opportunity to gain Bro
                                            Lin as a Follower.”</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat, who was sleeping on the bed, twitched a little at that, but did not
                                            move any further.</p>
                                        <p>A dim light flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes as he returned to the bed to begin
                                            his cultivation.</p>
                                        <p>He totally understood Lin TianAo’s words. They were to not just encourage
                                            him, but also to warn him. However, Zhou Weiqing had not told Lin TianAo
                                            what he had actually been training at. After all, his method of three
                                            thousand tempering was just too astonishing in the world. The Immortal Deity
                                            Technique could be said to be one of his greatest secrets, and he would not
                                            easily speak of it even amongst those close to him.</p>
                                        <p>The Three Thousand Tempering training was just the training and tempering of
                                            the Skills, and the worst that could happen was for his physique to be
                                            overdrained, but it was not an actual cultivation of Heavenly Energy. Only
                                            when actually cultivating Heavenly Energy would there be a chance of
                                            cultivation deviation. However, his Immortal Deity Technique was really
                                            unique in that sense. It was an extremely dangerous, almost deadly
                                            technique, but its benefit was that danger was only during the breakthrough
                                            of his Death Acupuncture Points. In terms of normal cultivation, there was
                                            only benefits and was exempt from the normal dangers of cultivation.</p>
                                        <p>A black light slowly flashed out in the room. This time, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            tempering his Touch of Darkness Skill.</p>
                                        <p>After the many fights he had, the more he realised how important and useful
                                            Control Skills were in fights, not just individual but even more so in
                                            teams. It was because of his many Control Skills that he had been able to
                                            stem the tide and save the day many a time, snatching victory from the jaws
                                            of defeat even when at a disadvantage against stronger opponents.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, the Touch of Darkness was far from being the strongest of
                                            his Stored Skills, or even his Control Skills. However, it was one of the
                                            more useful ones with various uses. Most importantly, it was able to improve
                                            his senses, and also with the additional benefit of being able to affect one
                                            or multiple targets with its many tentacles. As such, its potential was
                                            extremely great, and perhaps more so than most other Control Skills. As
                                            such, Zhou Weiqing had chosen to temper it, as it would help increase his
                                            combat strength the most in the shortest time.</p>
                                        <p>With his two previous experiences under his belt, Zhou Weiqing quickly fell
                                            into a rhythm with tempering the Touch of Darkness. Furthermore, this Touch
                                            of Darkness was different from his previous two Skills, as it lasted a much
                                            longer time. This also allowed him more opportunity to feel and understand
                                            it. Of course, it also meant he would be casting less of them in succession
                                            in the same amount of time.</p>
                                        <p>Besides the state of fatigue it left him in, Zhou Weiqing was almost in love
                                            with this three thousand tempering technique. Not only did it allow him to
                                            temper and strengthen a Skill, understand and comprehend the profound
                                            mysteries of his Attributes, it also sped up his Heavenly Energy Cultivation
                                            speed! What could be more suitable for him!?</p>
                                        <p>He had only gone through the three thousand tempering technique twice in the
                                            last 6-7 days, and already Zhou Weiqing felt as if his Heavenly Energy had
                                            improved more than his previous twenty days of cultivation. Given sufficient
                                            time, he expected that he might even be able to improve a level of Heavenly
                                            Energy every month within the Heavenly Shen Energy stage. That was also one
                                            reason why he was so enamoured with cultivation currently.</p>
