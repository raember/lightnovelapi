                                            on his rapier and sword-wielding hand! If he wanted to do the same, he would
                                            no longer be the top assassin in the world. Alas, in just a few moments of
                                            his hesitation, the strange energy had already settled into his arm and
                                            reached his shoulder.</p>
                                        <p>Right at this moment, a bright, clear voice rang out, though it was currently
                                            filled with a cold anger. “Since you have come, then stay here forever.”</p>
                                        <p>A brutal and overbearing force of HEavenly Energy appeared right in front of
                                            him without warning, a massive silver hand grabbing towards the assassin’s
                                            neck.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as the person appeared, the Heavenly King assassin was shocked to
                                            judge that it was a Heavenly King stage powerhouse!</p>
                                        <p>At this point, he no longer dared hesitate or even use his most familiar
                                            weapon. He knew if he stayed any longer, it would mean death. Frantically
                                            circulating all of his Heavenly Energy, his feet tapped the ground as he
                                            launched himself backwards in full retreat.</p>
                                        <p>Despite his fear, at the same time, joy rushed in his heart. The strange
                                            energy that had reached his shoulder had finally stopped, and was showing
                                            signs of slowly vanishing. As long as he could save his arm and hand, there
                                            would always be another chance for him to try again.</p>
                                        <p>The silver white light on his rapier also vanished, and the rapier warped
                                            into eight black lights before disappearing back into the assassin.</p>
                                        <p>This new Heavenly King stage powerhouse that had abruptly appeared was
                                            naturally Duan Tianlang. Now that he was here, how could he allow this
                                            assassin to leave so easily? The large silver hand in the sky abruptly
                                            exploded, warping into countless threads of silver, forming a large silver
                                            cage, enveloping the Heavenly King assassin.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Duan Tianlang was dressed in the full ‘Hate Sky no Handle’
                                            Legendary Set. As the crafter of the set for Long Shiya, how could he not
                                            have one of his own? It could be said that God Tier Consolidating Equipment
                                            Masters were definitely some of the most powerful forces in the entire
                                            world. The reason why the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was so feared was also
                                            because of the three God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters, just that
                                            they would not usually take action.</p>
                                        <p>A layer of silver light burst forth, warping instantly into a huge shield of
                                            light, covering the Heavenly King assassin once more. It was the Spatial
                                            Shackles.</p>
                                        <p>This was a Skill that Zhou Weiqing also had. However, when compared to Duan
                                            Tianlang using it, his seemed like mere child’s play.</p>
                                        <p>The Spatial Shackles of Duan Tianlang covered more than several dozen square
                                            metres, and its strength was terrifying indeed. For the Heavenly King
                                            assassin, he could only bounce off ineffectually. Without his black rapier,
                                            he was unable to breakthrough the barrier.</p>
                                        <p>A horrifying strength exploded forth as the octagon plum blossom hammer in
                                            Duan Tianlang’s hands smashed forward. Yet, perhaps even more terrifying was
                                            the fact that the Spatial Shackles was actually rapidly shrinking in around
                                            the assassin.</p>
                                        <p>What kind of power did Duan Tianlang have? His cultivation level had reached
                                            the maximum level of the Heavenly King stage years ago, just that he was
                                            unable to breakthrough to the Heavenly Emperor state. Added to the fact that
                                            he had an entire Legendary Set, his current strength was boosted to a
                                            monstrous degree. From Zhou Weiqing and the others’ descriptions, along with
                                            his own observations earlier, he could naturally tell that this Heavenly
                                            King assassin’s greatest strength was his speed, agility and offensive
                                            powers.</p>
                                        <p>According to Zhou Weiqing’s original plan, he would purposely leave a weak
                                            point for this Heavenly King assassin to exploit and launch his attack. By
                                            drawing him out, Duan Tianlang would be able to launch his own sneak attack
                                            against the assassin since he did not know they had a Heavenly King stage
                                            powerhouse on their side.</p>
                                        <p>However, Zhou Weiqing had never dreamed that the Hell’s Angel Skill of his
                                            would end up like that, causing both him and Tian’er to lose their abilities
                                            to fight as all their energy had been depleted. Otherwise, if Zhou Weiqing,
                                            Tian’er and Shangguan Xue’er had joined forces with their Saint Energy, it
                                            wouldn’t just be a simple matter of causing the Heavenly King assassin to
                                            lose control of his rapier for a short period of time.</p>
                                        <p>However, the trio did not understand Duan Tianlang’s power clearly.
                                            Currently, the usually gentle and warm God Tier Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master truly erupted with his full power. His overall combat prowess was
                                            indeed terrifying, far beyond the unbalanced Heavenly King assassin.</p>
                                        <p>Although the black rapier had been recalled, the Heavenly King assassin was
                                            still temporarily unable to use it. The rapier along with his right hand had
                                            been Sealed with Shangguan Xue’er’s Saint Energy earlier, and although it
                                            was on the verge of vanishing, recovery would still take a little while
                                            more, and he was temporarily unable to connect to his Physical Jewels. Alas,
                                            that was the drawback of focusing one’s power to the extreme, and now that
                                            he was unable to use it, it was a loss of the majority of his power. Yet,
                                            Duan Tianlang’s attack was already reaching, and with the Spatial Shackles
                                            power affect, the assassin’s speed and agility was severely restricted. Duan
                                            Tianlang attacked, and the Heavenly King assassin dodged, and just like that
                                            the two of them exchanged blows at lightning speed in the rapidly decreasing
                                            space. In order to prevent himself from being fully trapped, the Heavenly
                                            King assassin was forced to unleash his Heavenly Energy at full force to
                                            hold back the Spatial Shackles from shrinking too rapidly.</p>
                                        <p>The assassin was groaning inwardly secretly. He dared not have allow that
                                            terrifying hammer of Duan Tianlang’s to even touch him, his senses telling
                                            him that this Heavenly King powerhouse in front of him was not someone he
                                            could handle even at his full power. No matter the ‘Hate Sky no Handle’ or
                                            ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Sets, they chose to chase physical
                                            strength to the extreme. In a certain sense of things, it was similar to the
                                            Assembly Sets in a manner, just far stronger and more well rounded. Facing
                                            the massive hammer, though both sides were at the Heavenly King stage, the
                                            assassin knew that if it even brushed against him, he would definitely be
                                            severely injured. That was the terrifying power of a full Legendary Set.
                                            Currently, he could only keep dodging, hoping to wait for the time when he
                                            could use his rapier again to break free, or the time of the Spatial
                                            Shackles to run out… only then would he have a chance to escape.</p>
                                        <p>All of this happened on the city walls in a manner of seconds, and by the
                                            time the two Heavenly King powerhouses were entangled in their fight, the
                                            several hundred air bubbles from the Hell’s Angel had also fallen to the
                                            ground.</p>
                                        <p>It was as if the purplish black air bubbles had eyes upon them, spreading out
                                            to land perfectly on important targets. One of the first to get into trouble
                                            was one of the large siege towers.</p>
                                        <p>Below these siege towers were mainly wooden wheels. All of the materials had
                                            been brought by the three Kalise Regiments, and they had spent the last
                                            three days assembling them together. The siege towers were about twenty
                                            metres tall, almost at the same height as the Crescent City walls, able to
                                            hold thirty archers at the top, allowing them to face off against the
                                            archers atop the city walls.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, for the Peerless Regiment soldiers, out of all the siege weapons,
                                            the most useless were actually these siege towers. However, due to the sheer
                                            height of the towers, they were naturally the first few to be ‘taken care’
                                            off by the giant purplish black air bubbles.</p>
                                        <p>*Swoosh* One of the air bubbles landed on the siege tower, causing a strange
                                            screeching sound. The closest one could describe it would be when cooking
                                            with a pot of hot oil, and pouring a ladle of cold water inside.</p>
                                        <p>A dreadful scene played out next. The thirty archers and the over dozen
                                            shield bearers protecting them did not even have time to scream before they
                                            vanished along with the strange sound.</p>
                                        <p>All that everyone could see was just the purplish black bubble descend from
                                            the sky, creeping over the entire siege tower and it just vanished like
                                            that. As the bubbles fell on the ground, it was like a splash of a wave
                                            smashing onto the ground, spreading at least several dozen metres before
                                            dissipating. However, in that entire large radius of the each bubble’s fall,
                                            every single living being was just like the men on the siege tower…
                                            vanishing into thin air.</p>
                                        <p>Of the three Regiments, one was from the Bai Da Empire, and naturally they
                                            had their share of Jewel Masters and archers. Almost instantly, they
                                            reacted, and along with cries of surprise and shock, a rain of arrows and
                                            light beams of Skills flew upwards.</p>
                                        <p>The arrows did not have any effect, disintegrating before they even reached
                                            the air bubbles. As for the various light bolts that the Jewel Masters
                                            released, it actually caused the situation to grow worse.</p>
                                        <p>Those purplish black air bubbles actually broke upon contact from the skills…
                                            but what then? As they broke apart, a rain of purplish black liquid fell
                                            from the skies from each broken bubble instead!</p>
                                        <p>What was a living hell on earth? For the first time, the Heavenly Bow side on
                                            the city walls witnessed it firsthand. Each of the purplish black air
                                            bubbles had a horrifying destructive power, and just looking at the scene
                                            before them made them almost stop breathing.</p>
                                        <p>No enemy, no skill, nothing could hold back or withstand the purplish black
                                            air bubbles. Each of them burst when they landed or came into contact with
                                            something, spraying the light all about. Anything that came into contact
                                            with it, be it human or weapon, they were all assimilated.</p>
                                        <p>Everywhere they struck, it wasn’t even necessary to clear up the battlefield.
                                            Even the earth… all that was left were giant holes in the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Just watching from the vantage point of the city walls, it was truly a grand
                                            sight. Whenever an air bubble landed, it was like the entire ground became
                                            molten lava. All of the gathered siege weapons did not have a chance to come
                                            into play, and they were all disintegrated, including the fifty siege
                                            vehicles… not a single one was left. All that remained were countless of
                                            deep holes in the ground.</p>
                                        <p>At the back, the Heavy Infantry and Heavy Cavalry soldiers were considered
                                            much luckier. At least, they were still quite some distance away, and the
                                            Hell’s Angel only lasted three seconds. As such, only about ten or so of the
                                            bubbles actually struck them.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, just the mere ten bubbles exploding in their midst caused the two
                                            Battalions of Heavy Cavalry and two Battalions of Heavy Infantry to lose
                                            more than a third of their numbers.</p>
                                        <p>There were no violent explosions, no special lights or effects. The entire
                                            process was just so quick and simple, like an invisible giant hand had
                                            poured a immense jug of lava over the entire area. At least three thousand
                                            Kalise soldiers and all their various siege weapons disappeared instantly,
                                            with not even a single token to show that they had once been there.</p>
                                        <p>No matter how outstanding the Kalise army commander was, meeting such an
                                            unbelievable situation, he could only be shocked to the core.</p>
                                        <p>What kind of power was this… an act of god! No one could have expected, or
                                            even imagined, that something like this would happen. This had all happened
                                            under the circumstance that the siege weapons were rather spread out, and
                                            there were not many of the attacking soldiers packed into the area. Even so,
                                            they had suffered such a major loss in seconds. If the thirty thousand
                                            troops had been charging together in the attack? Perhaps… the number dead
                                            would have doubled or more!</p>
                                        <p>In that instant, everyone could only stare in stunned shock, even the two who
                                            had caused the entire thing to happen.</p>
