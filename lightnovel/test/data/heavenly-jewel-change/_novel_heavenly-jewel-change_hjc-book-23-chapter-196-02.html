                                            instant that his enemy had struck out at him, Zhou Weiqing did not even
                                            sense his presence. One could just imagine how skillful he was at
                                            concealment. Currently, Zhou Weiqing only had one thought. To live! To
                                            survive!</p>
                                        <p>As he rolled around in midair, the Ward of the Demon God had already sprang
                                            into existence, along with the automatic Immortal Deity Shield. Added to his
                                            Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation’s lightning screen around him, as well as
                                            his body’s power physical defense in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state,
                                            Zhou Weiqing could be said to be already in his strongest possible defensive
                                            state that his body currently possessed.</p>
                                        <p>Despite all of that, the black rapier which darted about like a venomous
                                            snake had still managed to leave a deep trail of blood on Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            chest area. If not for the fact that his instinctive sense of danger had
                                            allowed him to roll away at the last second, his heart would have been
                                            pierced through in that strike.</p>
                                        <p><i>What terrifying offensive capabilities! </i>Zhou Weiqing felt that even if
                                            it were his Master, just comparing the instantaneous burst of power in a
                                            single point, this assassin might even be slightly higher!</p>
                                        <p>His Blink Skill only gave him a split second of time to catch a breath, and
                                            the rapier that was like a disease which had invaded deep into one’s bones
                                            [2. A direct translation. Basically means an enemy which is hard to deal
                                            with] had already reached his throat once more.</p>
                                        <p>In the face of such critical danger, Zhou Weiqing’s depth of potential
                                            erupted once more. Five bouts of dark-gold light instantly sprang into
                                            existence nearly simultaneously. One after the other, they exploded in a
                                            horrible scraping sound, but they had successfully blocked that terrifying
                                            black rapier for the split second that he needed.</p>
                                        <p>Only at this point did Zhou Weiqing finally see what this assassin looked
                                            like. It was an ordinary face, ordinary to the point that no one would be
                                            able to pick him out of a crowd. He looked to be around twenty years of age,
                                            fully expressionless, and it was almost clear that he was wearing a mask. He
                                            was dressed in a set of ordinary Kalise Empire Infantry Soldier’s uniform,
                                            which was covered in fresh blood. Clearly, he had been hiding within the
                                            Kalise Empire Infantry Battalion previously.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not have the time to think about where this foe had come
                                            from, and who had sent him to kill him. All he could do now was try to stay
                                            alive.</p>
                                        <p>A giant black tiger’s illusory figure formed behind Zhou Weiqing’s back.
                                            However, it was not the Dark Demon God, as it did not have the scorpion’s
                                            tail or the massive wings. Instead, it was the Entropic Nether Tiger!</p>
                                        <p>As that formed, the black rapier had finally pierced through the five
                                            Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura. Unbelievably, the five
                                            protective shields had barely lasted a split second, only managing to slow
                                            the attack slightly before it once again pierced towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>The Ward of the Demon God and the Immortal Deity Shield had turned back on,
                                            but once again they were torn aside just so easily. Like a small bolt of
                                            lightning, the black rapier pierced right through Zhou Weiqing’s throat. At
                                            this point, Zhou Weiqing’s ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set did not yet
                                            cover his head or neck, and he also did not have any chance to dodge such a
                                            swift blow.</p>
                                        <p>“NOOO!!!” In the distance, both Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er howled in
                                            sorrow. Instantly, both of them used their respective secret arts to
                                            increase their speed to the maximum. Alas, they were still not in time.</p>
                                        <p>However, the subsequent scene caused this powerful assassin to stare dazed
                                            for a moment.</p>
                                        <p>That was because, though the black rapier had pierced through Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            throat, it did not draw any blood at all. Instead, Zhou Weiqing’s Legendary
                                            Hammers smashed out savagely towards him.</p>
                                        <p>A powerful glow of lightning burst forth as the Six Ultimate Godly Light
                                            Formation circulated to its maximum. Zhou Weiqing gathered almost all his
                                            remaining Heavenly Energy onto his Hammers. The black rapier was just too
                                            quick, so much so that Zhou Weiqing did not even have the time to release
                                            any Skills. All he could chase for was for his strike to land, as he knew
                                            that this would likely be his only chance. If he missed it… perhaps the only
                                            result for him would be death.</p>
                                        <p>Facing the Legendary Hammers’ attack, the black clad assassin’s reaction was
                                            equally fast. Lifting his left hand, palm outwards, he struck out in a
                                            parrying motion to clash directly with the Dual Legendary Hammers.</p>
                                        <p>A massive explosion, as if a bolt of thunder in the skies, and Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            entire body flew back.</p>
                                        <p>The terrifying strength of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set proved
                                            its worth once more. Although the cultivation level and power of the
                                            powerhouse assassin was far higher than Zhou Weiqing, but facing the full
                                            power of the Legendary Hammers, his entire body which had been moving
                                            swiftly was actually stalled in midair, his upper body actually forced to
                                            snap back from the massive impact. Zhou Weiqing also seized the opportunity
                                            and the throwback of the impact to allow himself to be flung back,
                                            temporarily escaping the black rapier’s attack.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing’s abundant combat experienced had saved
                                            him. All his efforts had given him just enough time to release his next step
                                            at the last possible second. The Heavenly Skill Image he had summoned
                                            earlier was the secret defensive Skill of the Entropic Nether Tiger, the
                                            ‘Nether State’, granting him the temporary immunity to physical attacks
                                            which had allowed him to survive that lethal blow to the neck. At the same
                                            time, the power of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set and the blow of
                                            the Legendary Hammers was just enough to give him time to catch his
                                            breath.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Shangguan Xue’er was charging right at the front, barely
                                            three hundred yards from Zhou Weiqing. Tian’er was close behind her, but Lin
                                            TianAo had fallen behind, as his speed was not his strong point.</p>
                                        <p>His reinforcements were clearly arriving soon, but Zhou Weiqing did not dare
                                            relax at all. The moment his foe had struck out at him, he had sensed that
                                            it was a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse. However, this was no ordinary
                                            Heavenly King powerhouse, but one trained in the arts of assassination. For
                                            a Heavenly King to actually use such ambushing tactics against a mere
                                            six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master… Zhou Weiqing could count his lucky stars
                                            that he had managed to survive!</p>
                                        <p>However, this Heavenly King Stage powerhouse’s cultivation level was already
                                            at the max, and even despite Zhou Weiqing’s sheer power, his foe had been
                                            able to shunt it off in time.</p>
                                        <p>Besides the black rapier in his hands, this Heavenly King powerhouse did not
                                            seem to have any other Consolidated Equipment. As Zhou Weiqing used the time
                                            that his Legendary Hammers had earned, the wings behind his back flapped
                                            crazily, increasing the momentum he had from being thrown back as he
                                            attempted to fly away. At the same time, he used the Silver Emperor
                                            Lightning Pierce to increase his speed by three times as he flew off.</p>
                                        <p>Facing a Heavenly King stage powerhouse, especially one with such terrifying
                                            offense, with even all his powerful defenses seeming like paper in front of
                                            him… Zhou Weiqing was clear that in order to survive, he would need to join
                                            up with Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er, only then would they have a chance.
                                            Otherwise, despite his previous success, it would barely take a few more
                                            blows for his foe to take his life.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since he left the Heavenly Snow Mountain, Zhou Weiqing had been
                                            extremely confident about his own strength. After all, even the Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain’s disciple, prince of the Lion Tribe, had not been able to
                                            defeat him. As a result, his own confidence had perhaps grown too inflated.
                                            Right at this moment, he truly understood that in this world, there were
                                            just too many things unknown, too many things he had to learn. Just like how
                                            he had taken so many people by surprise, if he was too overconfident, he
                                            would pay that same price that those who had fallen to him did. This
                                            Heavenly King stage powerhouse in front of him was indeed terrifying, far
                                            beyond what he could manage on his own.</p>
                                        <p>The short pause did not cause the the Heavenly King Stage assassin to slow
                                            down much, and he certainly did not stop. Even as his left hand had been
                                            knocked away by the sheer force of the impact, another series of black
                                            lights sprang out from his body. As Zhou Weiqing unleashed his Silver
                                            Emperor Lightning Pierce, he was shocked to suddenly find himself slamming
                                            into a web of black, and in moments, the terrifying keen piercing edge
                                            seemed to approach from behind.</p>
                                        <p><i>This…? This is the Touch of Darkness?! Could the Touch of Darkness could
                                            be used in such a manner? </i>Zhou Weiqing was truly taken aback. This black
                                            web that had blocked his way, wasn’t it the Touch of Darkness that was so
                                            familiar to him? The Darkness Skill that was one of his earliest Skills and
                                            had served him so well. The twelve tentacles of the Touch of Darkness had
                                            instead formed a large web in the skies, instead of trying to grab or
                                            grapple him, it was just used to forcefully block his way and prevent him
                                            from flying with his Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce’s boosted speed. In
                                            this way, no matter all his flying speed, he was actually unable to move
                                            forward even if he had not been actually Controlled.</p>
                                        <p>The black clad assassin was just too fast. Just as Zhou Weiqing had stalled
                                            for an instant, a cold chilly sensation gushed through him as the point of
                                            the rapier pierced right through his back and out his chest.</p>
                                        <p>The black rapier had struck so craftily, piercing right through the tiny gap
                                            of Zhou Weiqing’s currently incomplete ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary
                                            Set, from his upper back neck area all the way to the front of his chest.
                                            Although it did not pierce through the Consolidated Equipment at all, the
                                            terrifying frigid cold caused Zhou Weiqing’s heart to sink to the
                                            depths.</p>
                                        <p>Luckily, the ‘Nether State’ was still in effect [3. It’s actually not clear
                                            from the phrasing whether its still in effect, or he used it again. However,
                                            since the time is so short, I believe it should be the former]. With the
                                            physical immunity, once again the black rapier did not take his life and
                                            destroy his body. However, the terrifying darkness energy within the rapier
                                            still burst forth, raging crazily within him.</p>
                                        <p>The ‘Nether State’ was truly worthy of the Heavenly God Tier Skill that it
                                            was. Even under such a supreme disadvantageous situation, it still managed
                                            to barely protect Zhou Weiqing. It brought a total physical immunity, and
                                            though energy attacks were not immune, they would still have to erode the
                                            Nether State’s energy before actually being able to harm Zhou Weiqing. As
                                            such, Zhou Weiqing could sense that the time of the ‘Nether State’ lasting
                                            was rapidly reaching its end before its normal time. From the looks of
                                            things, it would no longer be able to save him for much longer.</p>
                                        <p>The black clad assassin was currently behind Zhou Weiqing, slightly above in
                                            a vantage position. His mouth curved in a mocking smirk as he looked down on
                                            the youth. Although he had truly been impressed by Zhou Weiqing’s reactions
                                            and skills over the past few seconds in reacting to his attacks, that did
                                            not stop him from killing Zhou Weiqing. In truth, the reason why he only had
                                            a single black rapier in his hands and no other Consolidated Equipment was
                                            actually very simple. The black rapier in his hand was not a single
                                            Consolidated Equipment, but an Assembly Set Sword! Just like how Lin TianAo
                                            had created an Assembly Set Shield, this black rapier of his was actually
                                            formed out of eight Consolidated black rapiers in an Assembly Set. He was
                                            just one step away from reaching his ninth and last one, where it could be
                                            considered a Legendary Set!</p>
                                        <p>Ordinarily speaking, a set of eight could already be barely considered a
                                            Legendary Set. However, for Assembly Sets, they were an exception. That was
                                            because their earlier pieces were all lower quality and weaker, that was the
                                            only reason they could continue stacking on in an assembly. Even so, a
                                            rapier that consisted of eight Assembly pieces… one could just imagine how
                                            terrifying the offense was. In a stark contrast and reversal from Lin
                                            TianAo’s aspirations, this black clad assassin had chased after an ultimate
                                            offense.</p>
