                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion had sent out exactly five thousand warriors; of them,
                                            three thousand were dressed fully in a silver mail, while two thousand were
                                            in ordinary cloth clothing. The strangest thing was that amongst the two
                                            thousand, almost half were actually females, though their stature were
                                            extremely large and well built.</p>
                                        <p>If Zhou Weiqing was still at the Peerless Battalion and he saw Hua Feng
                                            arranging to fight like this, he would definitely say: “How could you be so
                                            shameless… oh well, it might be shameless but I love it!”</p>
                                        <p>After all, they had accepted a bet of ten million gold coins, and almost no
                                            one had bet on the Peerless Battalion. Hua Feng’s original words were as
                                            such: “Well, some of us need to fight.” As such, besides the strongest three
                                            thousand of the Peerless Battalion soldiers, the Gold Crow Tribe and the
                                            Berserker Tribe had each sent out one thousand warriors.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Ma Long and Hong Yu had wanted to take this entire fight with
                                            their own men. Looking at the mountains and mountains of gold coins, totally
                                            ten million, their eyes had gone red. Ahhh, if they could have taken this
                                            entire fight, they could at least gain the lion share of it! Although they
                                            only had around two thousand true warriors per tribe, even if they had to
                                            gather the younger ones or older folks, ordinary soldiers would not be able
                                            to compare to them, and they were confident of gathering five thousand
                                            men.</p>
                                        <p>However, in the end, their suggestion had been rejected, ending up with the
                                            scene before them right now. If they won today’s fight, the Gold Crow Tribe
                                            and the Berserker Tribe would each earn a million gold coins. After all,
                                            this bet had been arranged by Hua Feng and the Peerless Battalion. Giving
                                            them this benefit was already considered Hua Feng giving them a lot of face.
                                            The other eight million would be ‘public’ Battalion funds. The reason was
                                            simple - many of those who had taken equipment or Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls still had not even started to pay back, and owed to the Battalion.
                                            Even their various payments or awards were far from sufficient; naturally
                                            these funds were used for Battalion purposes, and the Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers had some of their ‘debt’ removed.</p>
                                        <p>Regarding all these ‘behind-the-scene’ stories, naturally outsiders would not
                                            know anything about it. Looking at these five thousand Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers walk out of the camp, although they did look good indeed, when
                                            compared to the ten thousand Heavy Infantry soldiers dressed in full plate
                                            mail, looking like mobile fortresses… the Peerless Battalion soldiers looked
                                            like they would be easily crushed.</p>
                                        <p>This was a group battle. No matter if a particular soldier was stronger, in
                                            such a scale of battle that would not play a major role… unless they were a
                                            Heavenly King Stage powerhouse or higher.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji had previously ascertained that on the Peerless Battalion’s side,
                                            both Zhou Weiqing and his powerhouse teacher had left together, and were not
                                            currently with them. As for the other powerhouses in the Peerless battalion,
                                            though he knew of them, he dismissed them. After all, of the entire Seventh
                                            Legion, he had two most elite troops. The first was half his Regiment of
                                            Heavy Cavalry Troops, the five thousand of them were his finest elite
                                            warriors, and with another five thousand ordinary Heavy Cavalry soldiers
                                            forming his entire Heavy Cavalry Regiment. The next would be this Heavy
                                            Infantry Regiment in front of his eyes. All ten thousand of them were
                                            experienced warriors on the battlefield, and their most important task was
                                            to block the charge of the enemy cavalry soldiers, to hold the lines for the
                                            entire Legion. They were the bedrock of the Legion, and with their power
                                            tower shields and sheer physical strength from tough training… just in terms
                                            of personal soldier to soldier strength, they were perhaps even above the
                                            Heavy Cavalry soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>The Regiment Commander of the Heavy Infantry Regiment, Oni, was actually also
                                            the Vice Legion Commander of the Seventh Legion, only half a rank below Shen
                                            Ji. In the Seventh Legion, he definitely had a high status as well, and was
                                            a seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er, accompanied by Ma Long, Hong Yu and Lin TianAo, stood right
                                            at the front of the Peerless Battalion troop. Sweeping a cold gaze across
                                            the Peerless Battalion soldiers, she said passively: “As for what exactly
                                            you all need to do, I’m sure I do not need to explain any further… you all
                                            should know. If we actually lose, it won’t be a matter of losing the prize,
                                            I will also give you all some special training… and you all will learn what
                                            is the true meaning of hell… Do you all understand?”</p>
                                        <p>Originally, having heard that the majority of the bet would be used to
                                            depreciate their debts and their morale wasn’t extremely high, upon hearing
                                            Shangguan Fei’er’s words, the three thousand Peerless Battalion soldiers
                                            instantly seemed to perk up and become as ready as action as could be.</p>
                                        <p>This was not the first time Shangguan Fei’er had used such a tactic, but it
                                            proved as effective as ever. After all, those were not empty threats, and
                                            she would definitely do as she promised. Those Peerless Battalion soldiers
                                            who had gone through and experienced Shangguan Fei’er’s ‘special training’
                                            had long since spread the word about the terrifying hell-like training. In
                                            the entire Peerless Battalion, the beautiful Shangguan Fei’er had the
                                            nickname of Devil Goddess. That was not a nickname given lightly indeed.</p>
                                        <p>In the distance, Shangguan Xue’er looked upon her sister from a hidden
                                            corner. Lookig at her impressive and valiant looking sister, she suddenly
                                            felt a sense of envy. Although she was the heir to the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace, she had never felt such a sense of accomplishment like Shangguan
                                            Fei’er now. At this point, she suddenly felt a strange feeling of
                                            anticipation, awaiting the time when Fei’er would return to the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace and she would take her place. Could she do better than her
                                            little sister?</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Shen Ji rode atop a tall, large warhorse right to the middle
                                            of the two army formations. Loudly, he proclaimed: “As agreed, the fight
                                            between the Peerless Battalion and the Seventh Legion Heavy Infantry
                                            Regiment shall be starting soon. First, let me announce the fighting fashion
                                            and rules. Both sides will be sparring in close combat fashion, and no
                                            weapons will be allowed. Also, aiming to critically injure or kill one’s
                                            opponent is strictly forbidden. The battle will last for two hours, and the
                                            side which has the most remaining soldiers standing will be the victor.”</p>
                                        <p>The rules were very simple and straightforward. Without question, on a
                                            surface level, the Heavy Infantry Regiment held a massive advantage. Just in
                                            terms of numbers alone, they doubled the Peerless Battalion’s five thousand.
                                            Since the victory depended on the final number of soldiers standing, they
                                            already had a simple five thousand advantage from the side. However, the
                                            terms of this battle had not been drawn out by Shen Ji, but by Hua Feng!
                                            Without doubt, he had directly placed the Peerless Battalion in a dangerous
                                            position; otherwise there would not have been so many people lured to bet
                                            against them.</p>
                                        <p>If it were just five thousand versus five thousand, with the strength of the
                                            Peerless Battalion soldiers, did they really need to get the Berserker and
                                            Gold Crow Tribes to fight as well?</p>
                                        <p>No one else would believe that the Peerless Battalion could win. The reason
                                            was simple - besides the two new Tribes who had just joined the Peerless
                                            Battalion, all of the other soldiers were originally from the Northern
                                            Armies of the ZhongTian Empire… a bunch of mere ruffian soldiers. Most, or
                                            all, of them had committed some mistake or offended some higher ups for them
                                            to be sent to the various Ruffian Battalions. Yet, this Peerless Battalion
                                            of Zhou Weiqing’s had been set up for merely a year, and it could be said
                                            that no one truly understood them at all. The only person who knew the most
                                            was Shen Ji, and all he knew was that their archery had been trained to an
                                            impressive state. However, that did not mean their close combat would be
                                            just as good. Furthermore, in terms of close combat, the Heavy Infantry
                                            Regiment was considered one of the finest in the entire Legion, even in the
                                            Northwest Armies. Now that they were even at a two versus one advantage, how
                                            could the Peerless Battalion possibly defeat them?</p>
                                        <p>Any army officer worth his salt knew how to train his troops, just that
                                            methods would differ per person. Training a troop of soldiers for less than
                                            a year… even if if were the best trainer… that should not bring such a huge
                                            jump in quality… right?</p>
                                        <p>Preconceived perceptions caused the watching Northwest Army Officers to look
                                            at the Peerless Battalion with disdain, as they waited to collect their
                                            winnings… to see how the Peerless Battalion would deal with that massive
                                            payout.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, they did not know how much gold Zhou Weiqing had poured into the
                                            Peerless Battalion. Ignoring everything else, just in terms of the
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, the resources expended amounted to several
                                            dozen million gold coins! That was not even counting all their fine
                                            equipment and more so, the precious medicines that let all the Peerless
                                            Battalion soldiers become Jewel Masters! Even the gold rewards for the
                                            various Peerless Battalion soldiers were a considerable sum already. It
                                            could be said that the Peerless Battalion was the most expensive army troop
                                            in the entire history of the Boundless Mainland. Sometimes, a vast sum of
                                            money could be the catalyst to a massive improvement in quality.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Shen Ji finished announcing the rules, both sides started moving
                                            into formation.</p>
                                        <p>Their formations were extremely simple as well. After all, it was a close
                                            combat fight, and both sides just spread out in a single line formation
                                            across the plains facing each other. The neat lines of the Heavy Infantry
                                            Regiment caused them to look like a single long metal wall of a fortress,
                                            and with their strong, palpable killing intent, they were clearly ready to
                                            go.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er stood there calmly, saying solemnly: “Leave the enemy
                                            Regiment Commander to me. Everyone else, you just choose your own targets
                                            and everyone fight your own battles, there isn’t much tactics for this
                                            fight. Break open these metal cans!”</p>
                                        <p>“Fight, begin!” Shen Ji shouted out loud in the distance, having left the
                                            center of the battlefield. With his eight-Jeweled cultivation level, his
                                            voice was able to resonate throughout the entire battlefield and beyond.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavy Infantry Regiment truly lived up to their name as top elites. As
                                            soon as Shen Ji gave the order to start, all ten thousand of them started
                                            moving in steady, neat steps, marching in unison while maintaining
                                            formation. As they moved slowly towards the Peerless Battalion, the clanging
                                            of their armour struck up a cacophony. They did not run; after all their
                                            full armour was extremely heavy, but their slow advance brought a powerful
                                            pressure that was perhaps even stronger than a simple running charge, as if
                                            a mountain was bearing down upon their opponents. Without question, their
                                            momentum, aura and fighting spirit was constantly increasing as they
                                            advanced.</p>
                                        <p>As for the side of the Peerless Battalion, with a single command from
                                            Shangguan Fei’er, the five thousand of them also started charging towards
                                            the Heavy Infantry Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>There was no formation, no order or even a style. Five thousand soldiers,
                                            five thousand individuals, running and charging ahead with all their might.
                                            In that instant, the once-neat formation was scattered.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at such a sight, the watching officers almost burst out laughing. On
                                            the battlefield, what was the most important thing? Formations, orders,
                                            discipline… only by properly executing every order without fail could one
                                            defeat their enemies with ease. Currently, the Heavy Infantry Regiment were
                                            indeed in perfect formation, gathered densely together… wouldn’t the
                                            scattered and messy Peerless Battalion just be tantamount to committing
                                            suicide?</p>
                                        <p>However, very soon, as soon as both sides clashed, the smiles and smirks of
                                            those officers froze on their faces.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er charged forward ahead of everyone else, her speed was
                                            definitely the fastest, and her target was clear - the extra huge Regiment
                                            Commander. Not long ago, Shangguan Fei’er had finally broken through to the
                                            seven-Jeweled cultivation stage, and was at the same cultivation level as
                                            her opponent. However, do not forget that she was from the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace, and had the mutated Duo Physical Jewels. Indeed, wasn’t Shangguan
                                            Fei’er’s greatest strength her close combat capabilities?</p>
                                        <p>*BANG*</p>
                                        <p>The first contact between both sides happened between Shangguan Fei’er and
                                            the Heavy Infantry Regiment Commander, Oni.</p>
                                        <p>Oni had been itching for this fight for the entire day. In his eyes, a mere
                                            Peerless Battalion had dared to provoke them, to challenge them, and that
                                            was their own foolishness in committing suicide. Seeing an opponent charging
                                            at him, he did not hesitate to take a huge step forward. This fight was
                                            after all pitting their close combat capabilities. Previously, Shen Ji had
                                            already instructed both sides that no matter Heavenly Jewel Master, Physical
                                            or Elemental Jewel Masters, no one was allowed to use any Consolidated
                                            Equipment or Stored Skills, and it would only be a pugilistic fight, to
                                            prevent any unforeseen injuries or even death. After all, in the end both
                                            sides were allies.</p>
