                                            cultivating first. Come to think of it, actually I have a good plan for you,
                                            however I do not have the ability to create that type of Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scroll yet. You might need to wait a year at least for that.
                                            However, if you can wait that long, a unique six-piece set might not be
                                            impossible… and perhaps be much better for you. If you cannot wait, I can
                                            start on something else for you.”</p>
                                        <p>Without question, when he spoke of this, Zhou Weiqing had thought of Lin
                                            TianAo. Ma Qun was of the exact same attributes as Lin TianAo, both being
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters of pure defense. If Ma Qun could follow in Lin
                                            TianAo’s route of development, this could be of great help to him.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun thought for a moment, then said: “Boss, I trust you. I will wait.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and patted him on the shoulder, saying: “Well,
                                            perhaps… Just wait for me to return from the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and
                                            I will find you a specialised teacher.” Thinking about the time, that should
                                            also be around the time Lin TianAo would return from his own business.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to head to dinner before returning to his dorm
                                            to start creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, he was suddenly blocked
                                            by the few bald seniors once again.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun and Kou Rui revealed a guarded look in their eyes, but Zhou Weiqing
                                            just smiled faintly and said: “Senior Zang Lang, I thought it was about time
                                            you would look for me. Ma Qun, Kou Rui, you both go ahead to eat first, I’ll
                                            be fine here.”</p>
                                        <p>Zang Lang said: “Zhou Weiqing, let’s speak alone.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, and led by Zang Lang, both of them walked to a corner
                                            near the stairway.</p>
                                        <p>“So, what are your decisions?” Zhou Weiqing smiled and said.</p>
                                        <p>Zang Lang took a deep breath and looked hard at Zhou Weiqing once more before
                                            asking: “Is it really impossible to be the same as your classmates?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said passively: “I am not running a charity. Furthermore, you
                                            should know, every Consolidating Equipment Master has his limits. It is
                                            because you are my schoolmates that I am giving you face and not having any
                                            extra limitations. After all, each of you have your own values to stick
                                            to.”</p>
                                        <p>Zang Lang sighed and said: “You’re right, there is no free lunch in this
                                            world. I have discussed the issue with my classmates. Amongst the forty four
                                            of us, including myself, originally only three were willing to become your
                                            Follower. However, after your class beat up that noble class, there are now
                                            sixteen of us who are willing to become your Followers.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Have you heard of the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament?”</p>
                                        <p>Zang Lang started, not expecting Zhou Weiqing to change the topic so
                                            strangely at this point in time. “Yup, of course I have heard of it.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “In two days time, I will be representing the Academy to
                                            attend the Heavenly Jewel Tournament as a substitute team member, and I will
                                            only be back in about three months time. You do not need to rush to give me
                                            an answer, you can let your classmates think about it more. When I’m back,
                                            that will be their last opportunity. At that time, you can bring all those
                                            who wish to Follow me and look for me.” He had to leave soon, and did not
                                            have the time and energy to get them all to Follow him. After all, there was
                                            no rush to complete this, and he could easily wait til he returned.</p>
                                        <p>After hearing that Zhou Weiqing would be attending the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament, Zang Lang was taken aback. Originally, he had thought of Zhou
                                            Weiqing as merely a relatively strong person, the more important thing about
                                            him being his Consolidating Equipment Master status. However, it seemed that
                                            he was more than just an ordinary Consolidating Equipment Master… at least,
                                            his relation with the Academy was not ordinary! Not only did he get off easy
                                            after beating up nobles, he was still able to represent the academy for such
                                            a tournament! This was an honour that wasn’t easily granted, and was
                                            normally only for 4th year seniors!</p>
                                        <p>“I understand. I will let everyone know about this. Have a safe and
                                            successful trip.” Zang Lang extended a hand towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his hand, and said: “Train hard. What is a substitute
                                            worth. My goal is to try to become a first line team member, and also to
                                            bring those fellows from the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy to vie for the
                                            top four positions, and enter the Heavenly Jewel Island! Hahahaha.” In the
                                            midst of laughter, Zhou Weiqing turned and walked off.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s disappearing back, Zang Lang was suddenly struck by
                                            a strange feeling… that this youth before him was not exaggerating. Zhou
                                            Weiqing had given him a few more months of time, but Zang Lang knew that if
                                            in that time he truly managed to enter the Heavenly Jewel Island, his
                                            requirements for Followers would definitely become much higher. By that
                                            time, it wasn’t a matter whether or not he and his classmates were willing
                                            to Follow him, but a matter of whether Zhou Weiqing was whether to accept
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>With a light sigh, he suddenly felt that what Zhou Weiqing said was right.
                                            Instead of thinking so much, it was better to concentrate on training and
                                            cultivating hard. Personal strength was the most important after all.</p>
                                        <p>After eating his dinner, Zhou Weiqing did not rush back to his dorm, but
                                            vaulted across the wall instead, stealthily heading back to his home. His
                                            goal was simple, to get Yun Li to head to the Academy as well.</p>
                                        <p>After hearing that it had to do with creating Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls, Yun Li naturally did not protest. Both he and Zhou Weiqing had not
                                            finished their discussion last night, and he was more than happy to follow
                                            him into the Academy. As such, they both headed to the Academy and sneaked
                                            in.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly explained the current situation to Yun Li, who couldn’t
                                            help but cry out in surprise: “Are you mad? To create so many Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls for so many people… and for free?! What are you up
                                            to?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing sighed and said: “I will not hide anything from you. Both myself
                                            and Shangguan Bing’er are from the Heavenly Bow Empire. Our empire is small
                                            and weak… and the only way to change that is to have large numbers of
                                            talents. These commoner classmates of mine can all be called talents.
                                            Outstanding talents! Not only are they all Jewel Masters, they also have an
                                            outstanding grasp on military skills and tactics. My plan is to find a way
                                            to recruit some of them back. As the saying goes, One is obliged to help in
                                            return after receiving something, as long as a third of them are willing to
                                            Follow me wholeheartedly, my investment will have paid off.”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li shrugged and said: “Well, I’m just your Follower, if you’re willing to
                                            make that kind of investment, I will do as you say. Since you asked me to
                                            stay here, I can just stay here as a teacher. However, I will not be
                                            teaching anything, and will be researching on Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls still.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “No problems, the reason I asked you to enter
                                            the school was mostly to help protect my classmates, and not let them be
                                            bullied by the noble students. Come on, let’s discuss on the best designs
                                            for their Consolidated Equipment.”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li nodded, he was naturally most interested in anything to do with
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>After much discussions, the fact was proven that indeed Yun Li’s experience
                                            was a lot greater and more varied than Zhou Weiqing’s, especially in terms
                                            of design. According to the information provided by the commoner students,
                                            analysing and trying to find a most suitable fit for them, the two of them
                                            started designing the various scrolls. Their whole night was spent
                                            discussing and designing. Zhou Weiqing learned much from Yun Li, especially
                                            the experience in using the most basics to complete designs, that was
                                            extremely valuable experience. However, at the same time, Yun Li also learnt
                                            a lot from Zhou Weiqing, with his various strange and peculiar ideas which
                                            seemed to leap around, as well as Zhou Weiqing’s sect’s unique creation
                                            methods. In short, both benefitted greatly from that night’s work.</p>
                                        <p>In the next two days, Zhou Weiqing ended up just skipping lessons using the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament as an excuse. Besides bringing Yun Li to see Cai
                                            Cai once in order to confirm his hiring as an assistant teacher, as well as
                                            going out for meals, both he and Ming Li barely rested for four hours per
                                            day, and that was usually spent in cultivation. The rest of the time, they
                                            were all spent designing and creating Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of design, Zhou Weiqing was far from Yun Li. However, when it came
                                            to actual creation, even ten of Yun Li was no match for Zhou Weiqing. In a
                                            short span of three days, Yun Li had only creating three sets of Mid Level
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, while Zhou Weiqing had already completed
                                            twenty seven sets, not only successfully meeting all the current
                                            requirements of the commoner students, but with some spare to boot!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing left these extra scrolls with Yun Li, for him to use to purchase
                                            materials while he was gone.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing entered the commoner class once more, he was almost chased
                                            out… as his appearance was almost so different that he couldn’t be
                                            recognized.</p>
                                        <p>His clothes were all dirty, with many places stained with Consolidating Ink -
                                            which was almost impossible to wash out. His hair totally messy, and even
                                            with beard and mustache growing out. Furthermore, a person who hadn’t bathed
                                            for three days, how could he smell good? Although it wasn’t at the level of
                                            having his socks stick to the walls, it was already quite a sight...</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty, are you okay?” Shangguan Bing’er ignored the filth on Zhou
                                            Weiqing, as she asked with an aching heart. The others might only notice his
                                            clothes and hair, but Shangguan Bing’er could clearly see that in these
                                            three days, Zhou Weiqing had lost weight substantially.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “No problem, no problem at all. These few
                                            days, I have indeed accomplished much. Don’t stare at me like that, isn’t it
                                            all because of you all. Come come, it’s time to give out Scrolls, everyone
                                            has their own!” These few days, he had indeed accomplished a lot, and his
                                            personal gain was also huge. After the mutual learning with Yun Li, added on
                                            to his powerful Time Attribute, Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel that he had
                                            improved drastically. His Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls were
                                            almost in some ways equal to High Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls,
                                            especially in terms of Consolidating success rate, improving from the usual
                                            3 in a thousand chance to almost 7-8 in a thousand chance. As soon as he
                                            improved a little more, he was very close to breaking through to the High
                                            Level Consolidating Equipment Master rank!</p>
                                        <p>Hearing that it was time to distribute Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, a
                                            spark grew in all the students’ eyes. This time, Zhou Weiqing gave out
                                            almost twenty sets of scrolls. Besides the few Elemental Jewel Masters, only
                                            Shangguan Bing’er, Yan Zhexi and Ma Qun, the three Heavenly Jewel Masters
                                            did not get Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>Yan Zhexi and Ma Qun did not question them. Both of them had easily guessed
                                            that Zhou Weiqing did not give them their scrolls now in order to create
                                            stronger ones for them in the future… perhaps even an entire Set!</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua had arrived midway when Zhou Weiqing was giving out the scrolls.
                                            Looking at him grinning away as he gave out the scrolls to the Physical
                                            Jewel Master students, Ming Hua suddenly felt a cold fear grip her heart.
                                            She could clearly see the fanaticism arise in the students’ eyes as they
                                            received their Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. It wasn’t a fanaticism
                                            towards the Scrolls in their hands, but towards Zhou Weiqing, their monitor!
                                            After all, they were all commoners! This was the first time that each and
                                            everyone of them had their own Consolidating Equipment Scroll. Just like how
                                            a girl’s first time was most memorable to her, without question, this class
                                            monitor Zhou Weiqing had branded a seal in each of his classmate’s hearts…
                                            an unbreakable seal!</p>
                                        <p></p>
