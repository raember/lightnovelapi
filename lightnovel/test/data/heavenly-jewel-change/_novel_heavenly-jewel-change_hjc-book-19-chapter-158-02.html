                                            training exercise, and some sacrifices had to be made. The most important
                                            thing was to protect their own lives while taking down the enemy.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that the enemy had actually dismounted to retaliate, Campora was
                                            overjoyed. The enemy only numbered around five hundred, and previously it
                                            was only the advantage of their bows and arrows that had caused such a toll
                                            on his own forces. <i>Now, let’s see where else you can run to!</i></p>
                                        <p>The Unicorn Cavalry troops were extremely battle hardened and experienced,
                                            but they had never experienced such losses like today. Before Campora even
                                            gave the order, the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment swiftly formed an encirclement
                                            around the Peerless Battalion, quickly surrounding them, while still firing
                                            back all the time. Once the Peerless Battalion had been fully surrounded,
                                            the Unicorn Regiment charged forward as one.</p>
                                        <p>The powerful charge of the Unicorns coupled with the three metre long spears
                                            in their riders’ hands… if one were really struck by it directly, even an
                                            ordinary three-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master might be hardpressed to take
                                            such a blow easily. This was also the reason why Hua Feng gave the order to
                                            dismount and use the warhorses as cover. With the horses to block the first
                                            strike, the speed of the Unicorns would be affected. More importantly, once
                                            the first strike was blocked by the horses, the Peerless Battalion soldiers
                                            would have a much easier time to turn the tide.</p>
                                        <p>“Conserve Heavenly Energy as much as possible.” Hua Feng shouted out
                                            loud.</p>
                                        <p>He did not need to explain much further, and the Peerless Battalion soldiers
                                            instantly knew the meaning behind his words. The reason why they dared to
                                            face their enemy in close combat was because they all had the capability of
                                            flying, able to break away from battle anytime they chose. However, if they
                                            expended too much Heavenly Energy in the fight, they would no longer be able
                                            to fly, and wouldn’t that be a tragedy?</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion First Main Company were all equipped with large
                                            sabres. Interestingly enough, the sabres in their hands were actually all
                                            looted from their previous battle with the Swift Wolf Regiment. Those sabres
                                            were well crafted and perfectly suited for the battlefield, almost four chi
                                            in length, with the handle taking up about one chi. It could be gripped with
                                            both hands, and the blade was wide and thick. Its edge was not particularly
                                            sharp, but due to its heaviness, striking down with it at a good position,
                                            even a horses’ head could be cut off at once. More so, these sabres were now
                                            held by a bunch of powerful Physical Jewel Masters.</p>
                                        <p>Even if some of the Physical Jewel Masters were mainly Agility, Coordination
                                            or Flexibility type Physical Jewel Masters, their body had been enhanced by
                                            Heavenly Energy, and their strength and toughness were far beyond any
                                            ordinary soldiers. With their Heavenly Energy, in terms of strength and
                                            fighting power, they would not lose to these Unicorn Cavalry soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>The five hundred Peerless Battalion soldiers stood in a circulation
                                            formation, just like a giant hedgehog, all their sabres facing outwards.
                                            They were grouped in duos, teaming up perfectly with each other with
                                            practiced ease. In an instant, both sides clashed and fighting ensued.</p>
                                        <p>This time, not only had Zhou Weiqing brought the finest elites of the
                                            Peerless Battalion First Main Company, he had also brought along most of the
                                            powerhouse officers in the entire Battalion! All the Main Company Officers,
                                            Company Officers and their Vice officers burst forth with their greatest
                                            strength. These officers were all spread out in the entire troop, forming
                                            the steadfast pillars of the entire circular formation. With their powerful
                                            Six-Jeweled cultivation levels or higher, they could still use Heavenly
                                            Energy in their fight as long as they did not overdo it, and that would not
                                            affect their ability to fly later if necessary. There were almost forty or
                                            more officers in total, fortifying the entire formation. Adding on to the
                                            fact that there were the seven God Archers of the Heavenly Bow Unit in the
                                            center shooting with all their might, even though they had been totally
                                            surrounded by the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment, they were able to hold their own
                                            with no problems, at least for now.</p>
                                        <p>After just a few moments of attacking, the entire Unicorn Cavalry Regiment
                                            flew into a rage.</p>
                                        <p><i>Shameless, just too shameless! These humans are just too shameless! </i>That
                                            was the only thought in the entire Unicorn Cavalry Regiment soldiers’ minds.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>As both sides had started close combat fighting, the Unicorn Cavalry soldiers
                                            were all extremely confident. After all, they were used to their charge,
                                            attacks having a great effect, especially with their formidable skill with
                                            the spears. In their eyes, the enemy were all ranged specialists, and now
                                            that they had caught up, it should not take them long to wipe out this five
                                            hundred men.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, when it really came to the actual fighting, only then did they realise
                                            how difficult it was to deal with these bunch. The Peerless Battalion First
                                            Main Company’s most shameless action was that they did not even bother
                                            trying to defend themselves, focusing only on offense!</p>
                                        <p>By sacrificing their own warhorses to block the charge of the Unicorn Beasts
                                            and to slow them down, even when the Unicorn Cavalry soldiers used their
                                            spears to stab at them, they did not dodge. At most, they would turn their
                                            bodies slightly to prevent being hit on critical areas.</p>
                                        <p>As the spears stabbed down on the titanium mail armour, all that happened was
                                            sparks flying out, and not any actual damage caused. In fact, those who
                                            actually left a mark would already be the stronger fighters amongst the
                                            Unicorn Cavalry soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>Since they did not need to dodge or defend themselves, they naturally could
                                            attack at will, recklessly. You’re stabbing me? Fine, I will use my sabre to
                                            cut your Unicorn’s legs! Although the Unicorn was a low level Heavenly
                                            Beast, its defense was not comparable to the Ghost Demon Horses with their
                                            scales. If their legs were cut or damaged, what would happen? As riders fell
                                            to the ground, before they could get up, their heads would be cut off by the
                                            large sabres.</p>
                                        <p>The massive sabres flew out without any care, as if they were willing to
                                            exchange life for life, without a care about defense. The thing that made
                                            the Unicorn Cavalry soldiers so angry was that the circular formation was
                                            constantly revolving like a massive meat grinder. Any time there was a
                                            tougher fight, one instant they would be facing an ordinary Peerless
                                            Battalion soldier, the next instant it would be a powerful officer level
                                            Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>Much unlike their expectations, the situation in close combat was not much
                                            better for them than when they were fighting at ranged. For the moment, the
                                            Unicorn Cavalry Regiment was being killed at will by the circular formation,
                                            blood and meat flying everywhere as the death and injury toll rose.</p>
                                        <p>It was not to say that the Peerless Battalion First Main Company were
                                            stronger in terms of combat abilities as compared to the Gold Crow and
                                            Berserk Tribes. Although they were all Physical Jewel Masters, in terms of
                                            their physique, strength, durability and even toughness, they could not
                                            compare to these two powerful tribes. However, Zhou Weiqing had after all
                                            spared no expense in gearing them up, it could be said that the entire
                                            Peerless Battalion was armed to the teeth, let alone the most elite First
                                            Main Company. They were all like walking iron fortresses which could not be
                                            easily taken down, and this sheer superiority in equipment coupled with
                                            their Physical Jewel Master advantage caused the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment to
                                            be at a large disadvantage.</p>
                                        <p>Quickly, the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment started to change tactics, backing away
                                            and using their Unicorn Beasts to glide charge from a height. This way, they
                                            could bypass the warhorses blocking in the front and make full use of their
                                            cavalry advantage.</p>
                                        <p>However, the shameless tactics of the Peerless Battalion showed themselves
                                            once more, causing the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment to fly into a rage again. As
                                            the Unicorn Beasts glided above the Peerless Battalion, the Peerless
                                            Battalion soldiers reacted swiftly, all crouching down at once and lifting
                                            their sabres point up. The defense of the Unicorn Beasts were decent, but
                                            not great, especially their underbellies which were unprotected. As a
                                            result, almost every Unicorn Beast which had glided above the circular
                                            formation had gotten their bellies sliced open.</p>
                                        <p>Luo Ke Di stood right in the center of the circular formation together with
                                            the other Heavenly Bow Unit God Archers. They had not stopped firing arrows
                                            ever since the battle had started, taking down all the riders who had just
                                            lost their mounts but had fallen into the circular formation. At the same
                                            time, he complained out loud scoldingly: “So shameless, this is just too
                                            shameless. They are actually using the tactic ‘Targeting Bottom Sabres’[1.
                                            Literal Translation - basically a play on words it could also mean ‘Grabbing
                                            Privates’]. Old Scoundrel, what do you say your mind is made out of? Such a
                                            shameless tactic, how could you even think of it?”</p>
                                        <p>Mu En glanced at him, his face beaming with a large smile. “What Targeting
                                            Bottom Sabres or Stabbing Breast Spears, who cares! As long as it works, it
                                            is a good tactic. What so shameless about that? Or is letting your opponent
                                            kill you less shameless? If you are willing to do so, go ahead and run
                                            forward and let them kill you! This big bro won’t stop you.”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, that ‘Targeting Bottom Sabre’ tactic was indeed thought of by Mu En.
                                            Of course, such a tactic was not just restricted for the circular formation,
                                            with many other practical uses. It was just that there was no other
                                            opportunity to use them yet.</p>
                                        <p>Although the Peerless Battalion overall chief instructor for melee combat was
                                            Shangguan Fei’er, in the last few months, she had been busy helping all the
                                            soldiers Awaken their Personal Power Jewels. As such, some others had to
                                            support her and take over some of her teaching duties.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of one versus one combat, Shangguan Fei’er’s techniques were
                                            definitely top notch. However, in terms of fighting on a battlefield, many
                                            useful techniques were actually the simplest ones. This ‘Targeting Bottom
                                            Sabre’ was indeed thought up by Mu En, and when he passed down this
                                            extremely simple yet effect Skill, he had told the Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers in a very serious tone: “In this world, sometimes the more wretched
                                            or shameless a technique was, the more effective it was. As long as it could
                                            work, then it would no longer be wretched, it would be called being flexible
                                            and able to adapt, or even being experienced in combat. In the end, in a
                                            war, it was either your life or the enemies’ lives.”</p>
                                        <p>What origin were these Peerless Battalion soldiers from? They were either
                                            rogues or scoundrels themselves, and this whole series of ‘Shameless
                                            Tactics’ from Mu En were extremely suited to them, and they definitely
                                            picked it up at an unparalleled speed. This current usage of the ‘Targeting
                                            Bottom Sabre’ was also born out of those teachings.</p>
                                        <p>However, using this ‘Targeting Bottom Sabre’ tactic in the circular formation
                                            was at the base foundation of having the Seven God Archers of the Heavenly
                                            Bow Unit in the center of the formation supporting them all. After all,
                                            although these Unicorn Beastmen soldiers might have lost their mounts, they
                                            were still able to fight, and if they managed to get to a certain number to
                                            pincer attack with their comrades outside the formation, it would be
                                            extremely detrimental to the Peerless Battalion side.</p>
                                        <p>At that moment, the seven God Archers of the Heavenly Bow Unit also showed
                                            their full power, showing the Peerless Battalion First Main Company soldiers
                                            their true strength for the first time.</p>
                                        <p>A single sound of the bowstring, at least five arrows would shoot out at
                                            once, each finding a different target. Each and every single one of the
                                            riders who fell from their Unicorns, before they could even stand up, their
                                            lives had already fled from their eyes.</p>
                                        <p>The Beastmen were also people, with their own feelings and emotions, and they
                                            treasured their mounts like their own lives. Even though the Unicorn Cavalry
                                            soldiers knew that if a large number of them glided into the center of the
                                            formation, even the seven powerful archers opposing them would not be able
                                            to take care of all of them. However, that meant it would be sacrificing all
                                            their beloved Unicorn Beast mounts!</p>
                                        <p>As such, they hesitated, and soon they were once more caught up in the
                                            dogfight, entangled in fierce fighting. As the fighting progressed, more
                                            marks were left on the Peerless Battalion titanium mail armours, and on the
                                            other side, their enemies paid with their lives.</p>
                                        <p>The surrounding Unicorn Cavalry soldiers numbered more than six thousand at
                                            first, but their numbers were dwindling slowly. With Campora’s orders, the
                                            Unicorn Cavalry soldiers stopped attempting to glide above to attack.
                                            Instead, they continued attacking slowly, using the length of their spears
                                            to extend their formation. Their target was to kill off all the horses
                                            blocking their path first before moving out to attack again in a constant
                                            cycle. In this way, they were finally able to hold their own with their
                                            cavalry advantage.</p>
                                        <p>As this side was tangled up in a tough fight, on the other side, Zhou Weiqing
                                            was just about to show his invincible prowess.</p>
                                        <p>The sabre formation of the Wolf Cavalry soldiers had indeed given Zhou
                                            Weiqing some problems. Wrapped around the handle of their sabres were thin
                                            long metal chains, and as soon as the thrown sabres fell to the ground, they
                                            were immediately pulled back to their owners. In this way, the sabre
                                            formation could be in an infinite loop.</p>
