                                            underestimated the Six Ultimate Heavenly God. </p>
                                        <p>Even though the Destruction Attribute was powerful, it did not represent
                                            everything. Long Shiya had made a name for himself for so many years, and he
                                            even possessed the six different attributes - he was not someone that was
                                            easy to be dealt with. </p>
                                        <p>The moment their second battle had started, Long Shiya was already on the
                                            losing end. However, this was part of his plan. Even the outcome of their
                                            first battle was set up by the Six Ultimate Heavenly God. </p>
                                        <p>There were several powerhouses present, but in terms of combat experience,
                                            nobody was able to match up to Long Shiya. The Six Ultimate Heavenly God did
                                            not originally come from a Saint Land, however, he relied on himself and
                                            hard work to get to where he was today. One could well imagine how much
                                            hardship he had been through, as well as the amount of effort he had put in.
                                            It could be said that he had experienced countless battles of life and death
                                            in order to become a Heavenly Emperor - an achievement that he obtained by
                                            crawling back from the brink of death countless times. This was also the
                                            main reason why Xue AoTian had always been full of admiration for Long
                                            Shiya. </p>
                                        <p>Perhaps, Long Shiya did not have the most powerful cultivation base. However,
                                            he would absolutely not make a single mistake on the battlefield. As for his
                                            self-mocking sinister nature, it was largely due to Zhou Weiqing. After
                                            spending a long time with his precious disciple, he had learned a couple of
                                            things from Zhou Weiqing, such as plotting traps. </p>
                                        <p>Both Long Shiya and Shen Mo were Low Level Heavenly Gods - however, compared
                                            to Long Shiya, even though Shen Mo possessed the Destruction Attribute, his
                                            foundation was a far cry from Long Shiya’s. It had been several years since
                                            Long Shiya had become a Max Level Heavenly Emperor. His personal will had
                                            already been refined to a level that was extremely pure. Furthermore, his
                                            battles required him to constantly control all his different attributes.
                                            Even though the series of attack he launched in the first attack had drained
                                            a significant amount of his will, it was not as powerful as it looked.
                                            Additionally, he had swayed his body in the air intentionally, to mislead
                                            Shen Mo into thinking that he was weak. </p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya had been well-aware for a long time; he knew that he was not the
                                            deciding factor in terms of winning the Grand Tournament. However, he had
                                            set an objective for himself - he must attain victory in his personal
                                            battle. This objective was set the moment Shen Mo stepped into the
                                            battlefield.</p>
                                        <p>After that, when they both went back to their respective Saint Lands to
                                            recuperate, putting aside Long Shiya’s recovery speed, Zhou Weiqing had
                                            stealthily channeled a bout of pure Saint Energy into his master’s body,
                                            helping Long Shiya restore his will. </p>
                                        <p>Hence, when Long Shiya rose to the sky to fight Shen Mo for the second time,
                                            his will was actually completely restored. If he were to truly go all out in
                                            the fight against Shen Mo, his chances of victory were higher. However, just
                                            like what he had mentioned earlier, if they forcefully fight each other to
                                            the end, they would both be fatally injured. Long Shiya was not afraid of
                                            that, but their battle was not the only battle of the Grand Tournament! He
                                            had to remain strong enough to help his disciple in this Grand
                                            Tournament. </p>
                                        <p>Therefore, after the start of the second battle, Long Shiya had performed
                                            entirely according to what Shen Mo had anticipated. In truth, he had been
                                            accumulating his energy, waiting for the right opportunity to come. </p>
                                        <p>When the collision between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian had ignited their
                                            battle, the first opportunity had come. However at that time, Shen Mo had
                                            not completely let down his guard. Hence, Long Shiya endured patiently and
                                            held back. Because of that, Shen Mo’s vigilance towards him had completely
                                            vanished. The moment the second opportunity arose once again, Long Shiya
                                            would launch an attack. </p>
                                        <p>The tiny six-colored halos should not be underestimated - they could be
                                            considered as the most powerful attack Long Shiya had ever launched in his
                                            entire life, in which he spared no effort at all. </p>
                                        <p>The six attributes formed two halos, according to their respective ratios.
                                            The amount of power erupted the moment they merged together had greatly
                                            surpassed that of the Low Level Heavenly God Stage. More importantly, Long
                                            Shiya had poured all of the Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing had channeled
                                            into his body earlier into this attack, in order to ensure that Shen Mo had
                                            no chance of making a comeback. </p>
                                        <p>Shen Mo’s Destruction Attribute could not withstand the Six Ultimate Heavenly
                                            God’s full-force attack that was merged with Saint Energy. The six-colored
                                            halos left a mark in the center of his chest, separating Shen Mo from his
                                            Heavenly God Level Heavenly Core Nucleus. Additionally, it destroyed
                                            everything within his body, transforming it into nothing. </p>
                                        <p>Splat——</p>
                                        <p>Shen Mo spurted out a mouthful of black blood. Immediately after, a blood red
                                            light beam shot out of his chest; the six-colored halos quickly replaced the
                                            blood red light beam and a black Heavenly Core Nucleus abruptly appeared
                                            before landing right into Long Shiya’s hand. </p>
                                        <p>Shen Mo’s pupils gradually dilated; his entire body swayed violently in the
                                            air before he fell straight to the ground. He did not even have the chance
                                            to self-detonate. Regardless of how reluctant he was to admit defeat, it was
                                            impossible for him to change reality. His corpse had transformed into ashes
                                            and disappeared before it reached the ground. Without the protection of the
                                            Destruction Heavenly Core Nucleus, his body was extremely weak in the face
                                            of the attack of the six attributes. </p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya was taking deep breaths, gasping for air in the sky. He had paid a
                                            high price for this full-force attack - he was unable to use any of his
                                            Heavenly God Level powers at least for the time being. </p>
                                        <p>He looked towards the battle between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian on the other
                                            side. At this moment, their battle was extremely heated up. </p>
                                        <p>It was entirely a close combat battle - every collision created a huge
                                            distorted light halo. The Demon God that Zhou Weiqing had metamorphosed
                                            evidently had the upper hand, especially in terms of strength. It had
                                            completely overpowered the Destruction God. However, the Destruction God
                                            that Fen Tian metamorphosed was extremely tenacious. It was standing strong
                                            in the fact of the Demon God’s overbearing attacks. Their battle had already
                                            reached its climax.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya shook his head gently and sighed. He knew he was unable to
                                            interfere in a battle at such a level. Even if he rushed over, he would only
                                            bring inconvenience to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>After adjusting his body slightly and restoring a portion of his Heavenly
                                            Energy with the help of the Nature Celestial Territory next to him, he
                                            descended in the direction of the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain before
                                            joining the main battlefield on the ground, where his abilities were the
                                            most effective. </p>
                                        <p>Following the end of Long Shiya’s battle, it seemed as though the odds of
                                            victory were in favor of the Peerless Sect, the Heavenly Snow Mountain and
                                            the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. </p>
                                        <p>Putting aside the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the battle here lasted the
                                            longest. With the addition of Long Shiya into the battle on the ground, the
                                            entire situation had changed once more. </p>
                                        <p>Even though the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley had a much higher
                                            headcount, the Peerless Sect and the Heavenly Snow Mountain had three
                                            Heavenly Gods in their midst, including Dongfang Hanyue, the killing
                                            machine. Even though her offensive attacks had slowed down, the Tenebrous
                                            Dragon Slaying Spear continued to produce results with every attack. </p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian’s strength mainly reflected in his assistance - after he had
                                            coordinated with Dongfang Hanyue, charging and fighting over a period of
                                            time, he had calmed down. This was because the rate at which the Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain and its comrades were suffering casualties was alarming. If
                                            they continued to fight in that manner, even if they were to obtain the
                                            final victory, they would be left with only a few powerhouses. </p>
                                        <p>Hence, Xue AoTian had changed his tactic from delivering offensive attacks to
                                            providing support and assistance. Relying on his powerful strength, he
                                            constantly enhanced the physical condition of all his powerhouses. Under his
                                            help, both the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect powerhouses’
                                            ability to survive had significantly increased. </p>
                                        <p>Apart from Dongfang Hanyue, the people who inflicted the most casualties were
                                            the three Shangguan sisters. The three women formed a triangle battle
                                            formation, with Shangguan Xue’er at the front, and Shangguan Fei’er and
                                            Bing’er keeping guard at the two ends. This maximized the effects of
                                            Shangguan Xue’er’s attacks. At least a few dozen enemies had died in their
                                            Saint Core Nucleus allowed them to be fearless in the face of the enemy’s
                                            Destruction Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the Heavenly Snow Mountain had lost about twenty odd
                                            powerhouses. As for the Peerless Sect, due to their low headcount, they were
                                            only left with a few people. Right now, they had lost two Heavenly Kings,
                                            with one Heavenly King injured - they were all originally from the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect. On the other hand, the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley’s
                                            headcount had been reduced to approximately 300. If this went on, it would
                                            be hard to tell which side was going to emerge victorious.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect’s casualties
                                            were kept significantly low was mainly due to the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and
                                            Dongfang Hanyue. Even though the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain was
                                            vast, however, the area of individual spaces was still limited.
                                            The Tenebrous Demon Dragon had immediately occupied a huge area just by
                                            standing there. Hence, this prevented the advantage of the Blood Red Hell
                                            and the Passion Valley powerhouses’ high headcount to be fully utilized.
                                            Additionally, they were fighting within a small area, and the offensive
                                            power of Dongfang Hanyue’s Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear was that
                                            overbearing. After a while, very few powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell and
                                            the Passion Valley dared to fight her head on.</p>
                                        <p>As they exchanged blows within a short period of time, the entire Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain had lost a third of its height. These were Heavenly Kings and
                                            Emperors! The destructive power from their collisions were way too
                                            formidable. </p>
                                        <p>Even though Xue AoTian was extremely heartbroken, it was not something he
                                            could change. </p>
                                        <p>In the sky, the battle between the Sidhe and the two enormous dragons had
                                            reached a critical point.</p>
                                        <p>Perhaps it was because they sensed danger, the enormous dragons Hui Yao and
                                            Duo Si suddenly launched a suicidal type of attack. </p>
                                        <p>Intense dark red flames had caused a third of the Nature Celestial Territory
                                            Formation to become dark red in color. The two enormous dragons roared
                                            irritably - their enormous bodies stayed close to each other, and a huge
                                            dark red ball of light started forming around them, to the extent that the
                                            Nature Celestial Territory had no choice but to expand because of their
                                            sudden outburst. </p>
                                        <p>Mother Nature, created by the Sidhe Empress, immediately had a grave
                                            expression on her face - she knew what Hui Yao and his wife were doing. She
                                            placed her hands in front of her body and circled. The Nature Celestial
                                            Territory suddenly opened up like a mouth, spitting out Hui Yao and Duo Si.
                                            Immediately after, the massive amount of energy from the Life aura that came
                                            from the Nature Celestial Territory converged together and headed towards
                                            Mother Nature, including the energy released from the twelve Sidhe
                                            elders.</p>
