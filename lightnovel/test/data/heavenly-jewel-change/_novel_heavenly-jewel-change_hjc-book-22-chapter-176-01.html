                                            him enough time to grow… that could lead to unforeseen, even disastrous
                                            circumstances…</p>
                                        <p>Only the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian remained standing there
                                            impassive, his face still expressionless as if he did not care about
                                            anything. However, if one examined him closely, they would discover his gaze
                                            was also transfixed on Zhou Weiqing</p>
                                        <p>From Xue AoTian’s perspective, he was rather curious about Zhou Weiqing. He
                                            had heard a lot of news about this youth from his daughter, and at present,
                                            what he was about to do was to create a truly fair fight, although on the
                                            surface appearance he was helping Gu Yingbing.</p>
                                        <p>Regarding this young fellow who had stolen his daughter’s heart, Xue AoTian’s
                                            feelings were rather mixed. However, it was without a doubt that he was very
                                            curious about him, especially when he learned that Zhou Weiqing had the two
                                            Saint Attributes, Demonic and Time, that had piqued his interest even
                                            more.</p>
                                        <p>Of all the people present, the one who had the strongest impression on Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s current aura and presence was naturally Xue AoTian. Just like his
                                            daughter years ago, his own Divine and Spirit Attributes, the other two
                                            Saint Attributes, could clearly sense the Demonic and Time Saint Attributes
                                            from Zhou Weiqing. Vaguely, the four Saint Attributes were resonating with
                                            each other.</p>
                                        <p>The Tiger King Xue Aoying also felt a strange connection to Zhou Weiqing as
                                            well, and that was the reason why, though he did not know it. As for the
                                            Lion King and Prince, although they both had the Divine and Spirit
                                            Attributes as well, in terms of purity and strength, it was no match for the
                                            Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodlines. In addition to the fact that they
                                            had strong feelings of enmity and hatred for Zhou Weiqing, the ‘connection’
                                            with Zhou Weiqing was much weaker, even negligible.</p>
                                        <p>Perhaps, a large portion of why Xue AoTian was willing to give Zhou Weiqing a
                                            fair chance now was because of his two Saint Attributes.</p>
                                        <p>After all, he would never allow a useless person, a person without a good
                                            future, to become his son in law.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, all of Xue AoTian’s senses were focused on Zhou Weiqing, and
                                            almost as soon as Zhou Weiqing unleashed it, he sensed something different
                                            from his Demonic Change State.</p>
                                        <p>As the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, how could Xue AoTian not have any prior
                                            contact with the Heavenly Demon Sect? He had faced many of the powerhouses
                                            from the Heavenly Demon Sect in his time, and he naturally knew how powerful
                                            the Demonic Change State was. Even for himself, he was also wary about the
                                            unique powers of the Demonic Attribute and its special changes. However,
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s current Demonic Change State was different from any that he
                                            had seen before… perhaps at a higher state than any, even the current
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect Master’s!</p>
                                        <p>Heavenly God Tier. That was a terrifying state that could fully control and
                                            dominate all energy within their sphere of control. Xue AoTian could
                                            naturally sense every minor change, detailed flux in Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            body.</p>
                                        <p>The first thing about Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic Change State that he felt was
                                            the change in his spirit. For all the previous Heavenly Demon Sect
                                            powerhouses that Xue AoTian had met, even the Sect Master, when they entered
                                            their Demonic Change State, their spirit would fluctuate and be unsettled.
                                            However, this was not present for Zhou Weiqing. Indeed, when he entered the
                                            Demonic Change State, though his aura and presence underwent an entire
                                            upheaval, his spirit was still calm and peaceful like a lake of water. What
                                            did that mean? It was no longer as simple as a controlled Demonic Change
                                            State!</p>
                                        <p>The next was the sheer power within Zhou Weiqing’s bloodline. The Demonic
                                            Change State was originally a kind of mutated power that joined bloodline
                                            power with the Demonic Attribute. Generally speaking, it was unique factors
                                            within human bloodlines mixed with the Demonic Attribute, and it was exactly
                                            because the power held within the Demonic Attribute was far greater than
                                            that of the human bloodline, thus many Demonic Jewel Masters entered a
                                            crazed state, losing control etc etc.</p>
                                        <p>However, Zhou Weiqing’s situation was clearly very different. The bloodline
                                            power that merged with his Demonic Attribute was not just his own human
                                            bloodline, but also another bloodline that was no weaker… perhaps even
                                            stronger… than his own Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline. This
                                            bloodline… even this strongest powerhouse in the world, Xue AoTian, who
                                            controlled all the strongest Heavenly Beasts in the entire Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain… he had never seen any bloodline like this before. In fact, he had
                                            not even heard anything like it before.</p>
                                        <p>When these two powers merged together, it caused Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic
                                            Change State to become far stronger than anything he had seen before. The
                                            aura emitted by Zhou Weiqing was already far beyond any ordinary Demonic
                                            Change State.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er had told Xue AoTian regarding Zhou Weiqing, and how he had an
                                            incomparable talent in overwhelming Heavenly Beasts. Previously, when he his
                                            cultivation level was still very low, he had already managed to Skill Store
                                            so many powerful Skills. This was also the reason why Xue AoTian had chosen
                                            the route of overwhelming Heavenly Beasts during this first competition.
                                            After all, just in terms of cultivation level, he was just too far from Gu
                                            Yingbing, and the age difference was not inconsiderable. To keep the
                                            competition actually fair, he did not want a direct frontal clash between
                                            the two youths.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, as he continued sensing all the changes of Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic
                                            Change State, but Xue AoTian’s face remained impassive and expressionless.
                                            Despite that, his heart was actually filled with shock. What kind of
                                            bloodline did this Zhou Weiqing have? How could it be so powerful?!</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, as time passed, the shock in Xue TianAo’s heart grew stronger
                                            and stronger, so much so that one could almost describe it as tempestuous
                                            storms brewing and raging turbulent waves rolling. That was because he
                                            discovered that Zhou Weiqing’s bloodline was also of the Tiger type. More
                                            importantly, that bloodline seemed to have a strange complementary
                                            relationship with their own Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline!</p>
                                        <p>In that instant, Xue AoTian could fully understand why his daughter had
                                            looked for Zhou Weiqing to accompany him on such an easy whim. At that time,
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation level was low, and he was not able to hide any of
                                            his presence or aura.</p>
                                        <p>At that time, Tian’er had not only sensed the draw of the Four Saint
                                            Attributes reverberating and drawing upon each other, but also that
                                            complementary aura of their bloodlines that had so strongly drawn her to
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>As he thought up to that point, Xue AoTian’s heartbeat couldn’t help but beat
                                            rapidly. Even as the top powerhouse in the world, he was somehow unable to
                                            control his own heart from racing. That was because from Zhou Weiqing, he
                                            saw a possibility. The possibility of breaching the thirteenth Jewel - the
                                            legendary Heavenly Change! In that instant, the scales in his heart were
                                            trembling.</p>
                                        <p>At last, with a plop sound, the Snow Wolf King in front of Gu Yingbing fell
                                            to the ground. Overwhelming success. Wolves and Lions were not on the same
                                            level after all, and Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion perfectly countered
                                            the Snow Wolf King, especially since Gu Yingbing was already at the
                                            nine-Jeweled stage. More so, Gu Yingbing had already used his Spirit
                                            Attribute in pressuring the Snow Wolf King. The power of a Saint Attribute
                                            along with the superior bloodline; it was not that difficult to overwhelm
                                            the Snow Wolf King. The Divine and Spirit Dual Saint Attributes was one of
                                            the important techniques of the Heavenly Snow Mountain in suppressing or
                                            controlling Heavenly Beasts, so in a way the Snow Wolf King could be said to
                                            be used to being overwhelmed like that.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Gu Yingbing succeeded, on the other side, Zhou Weiqing also succeeded
                                            at almost the exact same time.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had raised his Demonic Right Leg behind him, his palms extended
                                            out. They could clearly see that between each ‘paw’, there was a ball of
                                            grey mist swirling. As for his bloodshot eyes, they were glowing with a
                                            shocking intensity, with a thick aura of suppression that somehow succeeded
                                            in overwhelming the other Snow Wolf King at the same time.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, this Snow Wolf King was not just afraid of Zhou Weiqing’s Dark
                                            Demon God Tiger aura, but also the Devour Skill in his hands. Any Heavenly
                                            Beast below the Heavenly God Tier stage would instinctively be terrified of
                                            the Devour Skill, and this was also one of the reasons why Zhou Weiqing had
                                            been able to overwhelm those powerful Heavenly Beasts in the past when his
                                            cultivation level was much lower, allowing him to Skill Store far beyond his
                                            normal level.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why he used the simple Demonic Change State instead of his newly
                                            gained Dragon-Tiger Transformation was because he still wanted to hide his
                                            true power. After all, the Solidified Dragon Spirit was not like his Dark
                                            Demon God Tiger bloodline inheritance, affecting his entire body. As such,
                                            after melding with the Solidified Dragon Spirit, he was no longer able to
                                            enter transformation state without entering the Demonic Change State. Of
                                            course, he could still not activate the Dragon-Tiger Transformation and only
                                            use the Demonic Change State. Furthermore, even as he used his current
                                            Demonic Change State, it was mainly only focused on presence and aura, and
                                            was not a large toll on his energy. He could even hide his wings, not
                                            allowing his full transformative state to be displayed in front of all the
                                            others. Even so, he had managed to succeed in overwhelming the Snow Wolf
                                            King. After all, overwhelming Heavenly Beasts was what he excelled in even
                                            in the past, let alone now that he had reached the six-Jeweled stage.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>The next few Heavenly Beasts, the fifth sixth and seventh, were all also at
                                            the Heavenly King Stage, just at the Mid Level, High Level and Max Level
                                            respectively.</p>
                                        <p>So far, Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing had used the same method as in the
                                            fourth round, in order to complete their overwhelming. Of course, the time
                                            taken had also continued increasing, but the two still continued
                                            succeeding.</p>
                                        <p>Seven out of the ten rounds had already completed, and both were still fully
                                            equal. Originally fully confident in his victory, Gu Yingbing’s disdain and
                                            scorn had changed to seriousness. He had a strange feeling that this current
                                            Zhou Weiqing was very different from the puny fellow he had easily trashed
                                            just a few months ago. Even his Demonic Change State seemed different. It
                                            might not be that easy to defeat him in terms of overwhelming Heavenly
                                            Beasts.</p>
                                        <p>For the entire group of onlookers, perhaps the most easy going one was
                                            surprisingly the Six Ultimate Emperor Long Shiya. He knew that Zhou Weiqing
                                            had not even used the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, but had already completed
                                            seven rounds of overwhelming. Although both sides looked exhausted, he was
                                            still confident that Zhou Weiqing had this in the bag.</p>
                                        <p>“You both may rest for an hour.” Once again, Xue AoTian proclaimed a rest
                                            time. This time, Gu Yingbing did not speak out, and the two youths sat down
                                            at once, quickly trying to recover their spirit and energy. They might have
                                            completed the first seven rounds, but that did not mean that the last three
                                            would be easy for them. Without question, it would be time for them to meet
                                            Heavenly Emperor stage Heavenly Beasts!</p>
                                        <p>Just like Heavenly Jewel Masters, in terms of cultivation level for Heavenly
                                            Beasts, it was also a massive gap between the Heavenly King stage and
                                            Heavenly Emperor stage. Both Gu Yingbing and Zhou Weiqing were not confident
                                            in continuing to succeed. After all, no matter how strong a bloodline was,
                                            there was a limit to how much it could bridge the gap in cultivation level
                                            and sheer power. Even if the Heavenly Emperor Beast was restricted from
                                            attacking them, it was still a difficult task.</p>
                                        <p>The superior feeling in Gu Yingbing’s heart had long dissipated, but he still
                                            did not think he would lose. As a nine-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, he was
                                            confident that his recovery speed was far superior to Zhou Weiqing,
                                            especially since he had the Spirit Attribute, his Spiritual Energy and
                                            recovery speed was definitely astonishing.</p>
