                                            unique qualities, and this quality aura was very connected to their first
                                            commander and his character.</p>
                                        <p>Just take Zhou Weiqing’s Peerless Battalion for example, it was full of a
                                            roguish air, almost mercenary in nature. Utilizing profits and Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s instigations, no matter what enemies they faced, they would charge
                                            without fear. This was something that had developed under Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            influence. No matter that Zhou Weiqing seldom trained the soldiers
                                            personally, but as the commander of the Peerless Battalion, the one who came
                                            up with all the rules and regulations, his actions and words would greatly
                                            influence the entire troop.</p>
                                        <p>This troop that had just arrived was also the same. Although their numbers
                                            were low, only about a thousand men in total, the sheer killing intent and
                                            smell of blood around them was enough to strike fear in any ordinary
                                            soldiers’ hearts. Without question, this was an elite force that had been
                                            forged in the flames of battle, clambering up from a hill of corpses and sea
                                            of blood. Their commander was after all a daring and bloodthirsty
                                            general.</p>
                                        <p>After making such a judgement, a cold smile crossed hou Weiqing’s lips. He
                                            thought to himself: <i>This Principal Cai Cai is trying to suppress me with
                                                aura and momentum! However, can she really succeed?</i></p>
                                        <p><i>Those fellows might have the aura of blood around them, but I have the
                                            lure of money. </i>Just a while ago, Zhou Weiqing had proclaimed a good
                                            reward to all his Peerless Battalion soldiers if they achieved a victory, a
                                            gold coin each. Although it was not a large amount; after all it was just
                                            seven hundred gold coins for seven hundred men, but in the Peerless
                                            Battalion warriors’ eyes, seven hundred versus seven hundred was tantamount
                                            to giving them a free gift of a gold coin each! Zhou Weiqing’s only request
                                            to them was that they were not allowed to use their Consolidated Bow and
                                            Wings.</p>
                                        <p>As for their strategy and tactics, Zhou Weiqing had already arranged it
                                            earlier. All they had to do now was to wait for everything to be
                                            prepared.</p>
                                        <p>Very quickly, all the thick cloths had been prepared and sent over. Under
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s direction, all the Peerless Battalion soldiers began to wrap
                                            their weapons with the cloth. On the VIP Stage, another person appeared. It
                                            was Ming Yu.</p>
                                        <p>Today, Ming Yu was dressed in a dark-red scale armour, which was adorned with
                                            spikes in many areas. In the distance, he almost looked like a huge
                                            porcupine, but once anyone got close to him, the scent of blood around him
                                            was more than enough to cause anyone to quail. As he walked up the VIP
                                            stage, most of the officials started to scatter aside, distancing themselves
                                            from him.</p>
                                        <p>Besides the nickname of God General, amongst the Fei Li upper echelons, Ming
                                            Yu had another nickname: God of Slaughter!</p>
                                        <p>As Ming Yu walked up to the VIP Stage, it was clear that his brow was
                                            furrowed. When he saw Princess Cai Cai, his expression was not joyful at
                                            all. Removing his helmet, he walked up to her and bowed deeply, saying:
                                            “Ming Yu greets Your Highness.”</p>
                                        <p>“General, no need for such formalities.”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai quickly said as she supported him up. She waved her hands, ordering
                                            her attendants to clear out, leaving the two alone.</p>
                                        <p>“I remember I told you not to provoke that Zhou Weiqing, why are you all
                                            fighting now?!” Ming Yu asked questioningly as soon as they were alone.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai smiled bitterly and said: “It is not that I went to provoke him, but
                                            he was the one who started causing trouble… what other choice did I have?”
                                            As such, she explained everything that had happened since the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire diplomatic party had arrived.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Cai Cai’s words, Ming Yu’s brow furrowed even further. Cai Cai
                                            continued: “That little brat is clearly here to show off, he wants to use it
                                            as an opportunity to gain the advantage during negotiations, so that we have
                                            to give in more during the negotiations. I’m sure you can see that as well…
                                            but his requests are just too much. Although he has the support of the
                                            ZhongTian Empire, but even if the Heavenly Bow Empire were at full strength,
                                            they would never dare ask our Emperor to come receive them. I had no choice
                                            but to accept his provocation, thus resulting in this bet. Currently, both
                                            sides are now equal, but this next round is of critical importance towards
                                            who can gain the final victory, or at least have the upper hand in doing so.
                                            Ming Yu, I will have to depend on you for this.”</p>
                                        <p>A cold light flashed in Ming Yu’s eyes, but as he looked at Cai Cai’s
                                            pleading eyes, he couldn’t help but shake his head and give a bitter smile:
                                            “I can only try my best. Since you have already called me here, can I not go
                                            to battle? I’ll get my personal guards to bind their weapons with the cloth
                                            then.”</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing his words, Cai Cai was extremely surprised. “Against Zhou
                                            Weiqing, do you not have any confidence? He did not even study for long in
                                            our Fei Li Military Academy, he shouldn’t be that good in command or
                                            tactics!”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu looked at her meaningfully for a moment before saying: “Empty words
                                            are useless. I have already said everything I needed to tell you previously,
                                            but you did not listen to me. You shall see for yourself, he will prove my
                                            words to you with his own strength. Of course, you do not need to worry, I
                                            will use everything I have to try to defeat him, that is because I am also
                                            curious to see what level this little brat has actually reached, to test
                                            myself against him. One last thing I must remind you… What sort of existence
                                            is the ZhongTian Empire? The Heaven’s Expanse Palace? Just think clearly… if
                                            this Zhou Weiqing does not have something that impresses them or qualities
                                            they admire, do you think they will waste time supporting him? To actually
                                            make the effort to send word to the Fei Li Empire, to go through all the
                                            trouble just to revive that Heavenly Bow Empire? Why is that so? Although
                                            that little rascal is still young, he is far more complicated than you can
                                            ever imagine. You are truly underestimating him far too much.”</p>
                                        <p>After speaking those words, Ming Yu drew his black cape around him before
                                            turning to leave.</p>
                                        <p>Standing there, Cai Cai’s eyes were filled with shock. She was an intelligent
                                            person, and having been warned a second time by Ming Yu, she instantly
                                            thought of many things. Alas, the situation was already in motion, and they
                                            were like an arrow nocked on a bowstring, with no choice but to be shot out.
                                            She could only continue with this bet. Originally, her heart that had been
                                            filled with confidence was now truly shaken.</p>
                                        <p>The Royal Family Cavalry troop parted, and slowly a group of warriors dressed
                                            in black armour walked to the center of the drilling ground.</p>
                                        <p>The moment they entered, all the Peerless Battalion soldiers who had been
                                            lazing around on the ground suddenly perked up. These fellows from the First
                                            Main Company were all soldiers who had been surviving on countless
                                            battlefields, and as their opponent appeared, they could instantly judge how
                                            strong they were. Such a thick scent of blood and killing intent, they
                                            immediately sensed that the boring fight that they thought they would have
                                            to go through was going to be interesting indeed. Of course, it was just
                                            interesting, not even dangerous!</p>
                                        <p>Dressed in his dark red armour, Ming Yu was mounted upon his steed at the
                                            front of his troop. To Zhou Weiqing’s surprise, Ming Yu’s war steed was
                                            exactly the same as his own, a single-horned Ghost Demon Horse, and
                                            shockingly, the seven hundred cavalry soldiers behind him were all mounted
                                            on Ghost Demon Horses! This as the Cavalry troop that Zhou Weiqing had
                                            originally wanted to form! He had not imagined that Ming Yu had already
                                            beaten him to it.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu did not wear a helmet, and thus Zhou Weiqing instantly recognized
                                            this Fei Li God General. Upon seeing his appearance, Zhou Weiqing also felt
                                            his heart grip with wariness and respect. As the saying goes, a man’s
                                            reputation was like a tree’s shadow [1. Literal translation, and pretty
                                            literal meaning as well. Basically means that someone’s name and reputation
                                            is based on his deeds, just like the taller a tree, the larger its shadow;
                                            if it is a crooked tree, it will have a crooked shadow], for Ming Yu to be
                                            able to lead the Fei Li Empire armies to withstand the WanShou Empire
                                            armies, he was truly an outstanding military genius.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had personally witnessed the strength and power of the WanShou
                                            Empire forces, and he knew that it was difficult for any ordinary human army
                                            to achieve victory over such powerful forces. However, he had gotten news
                                            that in the past few years, the Fei Li Empire’s border war losses were
                                            actually even lesser than the ZhongTian Empire’s. What did that prove? It
                                            showed that the Fei Li Empire was actually more than holding its own against
                                            the WanShou Empire! Of course, there was also the factor that the WanShou
                                            Empire focused more resources on the ZhongTian side, but at the same time,
                                            how could the Fei Li armies compare with the ZhongTian Empire armies? No
                                            matter what, the facts proved that Ming Yu truly lived up to his name.</p>
                                        <p>As such, Zhou Weiqing would not underestimate Ming Yu at all, especially
                                            since he was leading such a troop of Ghost Demon Horse cavalry!</p>
                                        <p>Nudging his horse with his foot, Zhou Weiqing rode forth all the way until he
                                            was about thirty yards from Ming Yu before stopping.</p>
                                        <p>As he drew closer to Ming Yu’s troop, the more Zhou Weiqing could sense that
                                            inherent killing intent they had. It was not focused at him, but all of them
                                            had it hidden in their eyes, cold and indifferent eyes that seemed to pay no
                                            importance to life itself! Not only the lives of their enemies, but even
                                            their own! The weapons in their hands were long spears, and the black armour
                                            that they were was a strange hybrid between light armour and heavy armour.
                                            Although the spears had already been covered with the thick cloths, Zhou
                                            Weiqing could still sense their keen edge indistinctly.</p>
                                        <p>Facing such a troop, if one did not have a strong willpower, perhaps they
                                            would break down before even clashing.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, for a troop to have such a air and quality about them, how could
                                            their combat prowess be weak?</p>
                                        <p>“General Ming Yu, it has been a long time!” Zhou Weiqing smiled widely at
                                            Ming Yu, revealing a row of white teeth. However, his eyes were not that
                                            friendly, almost as if he was admiring a piece of art, wandering across Ming
                                            Yu from top to bottom.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu smiled faintly and said: “It has only been a few years indeed, but
                                            you have changed so much that I almost did not recognize you. It looks like
                                            my foresight at that time was pretty accurate after all. I am starting to
                                            regret, why I didn’t take you directly from the Fei Li Military Academy. If
                                            I had done so, perhaps you would be my right hand man now.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “That might not be so, why should I
                                            be your right hand man, you can be my right hand man instead right?
                                            Furthermore, even if you tried to take me from the Academy that time, I
                                            would never have agreed. Your troop does not have any beauties at all, why
                                            would I even bother going?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s shameless words, Ming Yu’s gaze couldn’t help but
                                            drift towards Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er in the distance, and he said in
                                            admiration: “Well, in that regard I am truly no match for you. You are a
                                            master indeed, to be able to gain the love of such top beauties. I am
                                            impressed indeed, respect, respect. If there is any chance, you must teach
                                            me a few tricks. I am already forty years old, but still do not have a
                                            wife…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “That is no problem at all. If
                                            General Ming Yu is willing to join my Heavenly Bow Empire, you can have the
                                            pick of women from the Empire!”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu did not seem to hear the hidden meaning in Zhou Weiqing’s words,
                                            still smiling as he said: “Commander Zhou, I wonder where your Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire is!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “It will be back soon, no worries, it will not
                                            be long before the Heavenly Bow Empire is revived.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
