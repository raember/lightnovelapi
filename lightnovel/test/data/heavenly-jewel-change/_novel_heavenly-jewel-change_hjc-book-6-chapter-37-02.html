                                            otherwise he would probably not have created such a Legendary Set that is
                                            just so difficult to create.”</p>
                                        <p>Huyan Aobo’s words caused Zhou Weiqing’s heart to race in excitement. Indeed,
                                            as compared to traditional Heavenly Jewel Masters who Consolidated Legendary
                                            Sets, he had a huge advantage. Whether or not he could become a god tier
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master, he would at least be able to save an immense
                                            amount of materials. After all, for him, a single scroll was sufficient to
                                            Consolidate Equipment; thus saving a large amount of Consolidating Ink.</p>
                                        <p>Just like the current single scroll they had, to others it was perhaps of not
                                            much use, but to him, it was sufficient to guarantee success.</p>
                                        <p>Huyan Aobo stood up and said with a faint smile: “Alright, you’ve gone
                                            through a lot these few months and must be exhausted. You will be leaving in
                                            a few days, so you should get a good rest as well. Completing the last few
                                            sets of basic scrolls is important, but my precious disciple’s body is just
                                            as important. You should cultivate your Heavenly Energy while resting, that
                                            will aid in your body’s recovery as well.”</p>
                                        <p>After Huyan Aobo left, Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile. Cultivate Heavenly
                                            Energy? He really didn’t dare to focus too much on his cultivation any
                                            longer. After staying the Flying Hill City for four months, although most of
                                            his time had been spent focusing on creating Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls, however, that required him to use an immense amount of Heavenly
                                            Energy, nearly draining himself, before recovering and repeating the process
                                            once again. That, in itself, was a method of cultivation. Furthermore, his
                                            Immortal Deity Technique was different from other cultivation techniques,
                                            and even if he did not focus on cultivation, it would still improve on its
                                            own. During these four months, he was unexpectedly closing in on the maximum
                                            point of his level, and he did not know when he would have to breakthrough
                                            the twelfth Death Acupuncture Point.</p>
                                        <p>However, the sheer pain from breaking through Death Acupuncture Points had
                                            left a shadow in his heart. Furthermore, with Shangguan Bing’er not by his
                                            side, he did not dare to breakthrough the Death Acupuncture Points, fearing
                                            that he would not be able to withstand the pain. Even with her by his side,
                                            the previous times he had barely been able to get through it, and his
                                            character was originally already afraid of pain and death. As such, he
                                            naturally did not want to focus on cultivating now, and he would only do so
                                            after reaching the Fei Li City and reuniting with Shangguan Bing’er. As
                                            such, he decided to complete the last 3 sets of basic Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>Over the next few days, Zhou Weiqing slowed down the speed and length of time
                                            he used to create the scrolls, ensuring he got sufficient rest. Just like
                                            that, in a blink of an eye, the three days had passed, and when night fell,
                                            he had finally completed the last sheet of Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>A dim green light surrounded his body as the brush tip flowed in a silver
                                            light. At this moment, the two Elemental Jewels at his right wrist was
                                            glowing silver and green respectively, representing the Spatial and Wind
                                            attributes he was using. Under the two attributes, his movements were like
                                            flowing water across the surface of the Consolidating Paper. He had already
                                            created nearly a thousand of this particular design, and was already very
                                            familiar with it, and as he flourished the last brushstroke, the ink and
                                            paper melded perfectly in a dazzling flash of gold light. Completion!</p>
                                        <p>“The 1000th scroll! Hahaha! I’m finally done!” Zhou Weiqing threw the brush
                                            in his hands, falling backwards, and lying down without a care about his
                                            looks. As he fell back right in the middle of the room, he greedily took in
                                            gulps of air as he finally relaxed.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, he had completed all 392 sets of basic Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls! 4 months of non stop effort and focus, he had finally succeeded. A
                                            sense of accomplishment flooded his heart, and he felt a sense of relaxation
                                            he had never felt before as his tense muscles relaxed. The events of the
                                            past four months scrolled past in his mind as he lay on his back,
                                            thinking.</p>
                                        <p>Closing his eyes, Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel the blood circulating in
                                            his body, and he felt as if he did not even want to move a finger, just
                                            lying there comfortably.</p>
                                        <p>The vision blurred before him as his whole body relaxed, as exhaustion
                                            flooded every cell of his body, his breathing steadied and he slowly fell
                                            asleep there.</p>
                                        <p>After an unknown amount of time, the cute little white tiger Fat Cat, which
                                            had been sleeping beside Zhou Weiqing snuggled up to him, suddenly stood up.
                                            Its pale purple eyes were excited, as they focused on Zhou Weiqing, as the
                                            ‘King’ tatoo on its head seeming to move a little. All of a sudden, it
                                            seemed to discover something, jumping to Zhou Weiqing’s head and placing its
                                            front paw onto Zhou Weiqing’s face and pushing at him, all the while giving
                                            out a low roar.</p>
                                        <p>“Stop it, Fat Cat.” Zhou Weiqing turned around lazily and pushed it aside,
                                            settling back to sleep. However, it insistently jumped back to the other
                                            side and continued pushing his head.</p>
                                        <p>This time, Zhou Weiqing woke up a little. “Eh? Why is it so hot.” He furrowed
                                            his brow, pulling at his shirt. However, the next instant, his eyes shot
                                            open wide in surprise.</p>
                                        <p>With a soft *poof* sound, Zhou Weiqing’s clothes almost disintegrated into
                                            dust, surprising Fat Cat which was beside him, and causing it to roll a few
                                            yards away.</p>
                                        <p>Just an instant ago, Zhou Weiqing was deep in sleep, but right at this point,
                                            his entire body was bathed in cold sweat, a sense of terror invading his
                                            heart. The black tiger tattoos sprang back onto the surface of his skin like
                                            magic, seeming to ripple like a shockwave around his body. The Heavenly
                                            Energy within his body seemed to surge forth like boiling water, raging
                                            turbulently throughout his body, heading towards the 3rd section of the
                                            spinous process of his lumbar vertebra, targeting the <a
                                                    href="http://baike.baidu.com/view/389285.htm">Qi Hai Acupuncture
                                                Point</a>, which was the 7th Death Acupuncture Point of the second
                                            portion of the Immortal Deity Technique.</p>
                                        <p>What Zhou Weiqing had feared the most had happened after all. Just half a
                                            year had passed since he had last broken through the 6th Death Acupuncture
                                            Point, and in this last four months, although he had not focused on
                                            cultivation, the incessant usage of Heavenly Energy had caused his energy
                                            whirlpools to spin at max speeds in drawing energy in replenishing his
                                            constantly drained reserves. As such, although he did not attempt breaking
                                            through his Death Acupuncture Points, his Heavenly Energy had already
                                            reached its maximum capacity. Previously, when he had completed the final
                                            scroll, his consciousness had relaxed totally and falling asleep, he had
                                            forgotten to continue controlling his Heavenly Energy. As his Heavenly
                                            Energy circulated naturally, they reached their ‘limit’ and started
                                            circulating savagely and automatically breaking through his next Death
                                            Acupuncture Point.</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat had felt something wrong with his body which was why it started
                                            trying to wake him up. Under no preparation, the surging Heavenly Energy
                                            charged forth towards his 12th Death Acupuncture Point.</p>
                                        <p>“Damn! Isn’t this forcing a young girl into prostitution[1. Direct
                                            Translation - basically meaning being forced into a corner]?” Zhou Weiqing
                                            cried in grief and indignation in his heart. At this time, he wasn’t even
                                            able to call out as the surging Heavenly Energy had torn away from his
                                            control, forcing its way towards the Qi Hai Acupuncture Point, like a slowly
                                            advancing army.</p>
                                        <p>As the second portion of the Immortal Deity Technique had the Death
                                            Acupuncture Points all situated at the back, as such, as his Heavenly Energy
                                            advanced towards the Qi Hai Acupuncture Point, it passed by the previous six
                                            Acupuncture Points on the back, and every time it passed through one, the
                                            Heavenly Energy would be boosted by the energy whirlpool and become wilder
                                            and more frenzied, and it seemed to be an unstoppable advance.</p>
                                        <p>By now, Zhou Weiqing felt as if his spine was like a red hot rod, feeling an
                                            unbelievable pain! How many nerves were there in the spinal vertebra? They
                                            were all being jarred by the terrifying surge of Heavenly Energy, and such a
                                            feeling was definitely not for humans. He was almost unable to stand the
                                            pain, his body writhing on the ground uncontrollably, each time he
                                            shuddered, the black tattoos on his body seemingly growing more obvious, and
                                            the muscles on his body seemed to grow larger, the veins under his skin
                                            bulging out obviously. As he writhed on the floor, the sheer pain caused his
                                            Demonic Change state to activate, but even under that state, he was still
                                            disabled by the agony, the only change being the increased recovery, which
                                            actually seemed to make the agony even worse.</p>
                                        <p>The Qi Hai Acupuncture Point was one of the most important Death Acupuncture
                                            Points in the entire body, the main reason was because it was where the
                                            Heavenly Energy was usually stored. [2. Qi Hai literally means Qi Ocean] The
                                            Qi Hai was at the Dantian, and that was where the Heavenly Energy coalesced!
                                            Currently, all his Heavenly Energy was rushing in front every other part of
                                            his body, charging down towards the Qi Hai Acupuncture Point. Zhou Weiqing
                                            believed that if not for the Demonic Change state regenerating his
                                            meridians; if not for the improved physique and toughness he had after
                                            swallowing the black pearl, his Qi Hai and Dantian would have already
                                            exploded by now.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was cursing the creator of this goddamn Immortal
                                            Deity Technique, insulting all his ancestors down 18 generations. Alas, he
                                            could do nothing but watch as the raging Heavenly Energy headed down slowly,
                                            reaching his Qi Hai Acupuncture Point.</p>
                                        <p>“Come then, if I had to die then so be it.” The intense agony caused him to
                                            go crazy; at this time his heart was longing for Bing’er, such a crazed
                                            longing that was unbelievably intense. <i>If only Bing’er was at my
                                                side...</i></p>
                                        <p>*BANG*! His Heavenly Energy was like the ocean with many rivers flowing into
                                            it[3. Direct translation of an idiom 海纳百川 - pretty much as translated, just
                                            that it’s rather awkward in english], and it finally reached the Qi Hai
                                            Acupuncture Point. As his Heavenly Energy was already long maxed, as soon as
                                            it entered the Qi Hai Acupuncture Point, it broke through almost
                                            instantly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing felt as if something exploded apart in his body, although his
                                            Dantian did not disintegrate directly, holes were torn into it by the
                                            explosion. The raging Heavenly Energy did not stop there, continuing on
                                            towards the rest of his body, causing his entire skin to erupt with a layer
                                            of blood.</p>
                                        <p>*Peng* The door was knocked open, and Huyan Aobo and Feng Yu rushed in.
                                            However, as soon as they entered the room, they halted in shock. Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s current situation was just too horrifying.</p>
                                        <p>His entire body was covered with a layer of blood, his muscles torn and veins
                                            rippling, while the black tiger tattoo was thick and obvious around his
                                            body, seeming to move constantly, while a thick Heavenly Energy surged
                                            uncontrollably within his body.</p>
                                        <p>In Huyan Aobo and Feng Yu’s eyes, something had clearly gone wrong with Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s cultivation. Qigong Deviation! [4. 走火入魔 (Zuo Huo Ru Mo) which is a
                                            very common term in wuxia/xianxia, meaning something terrible going wrong
                                            during cultivation, causing problems with consciousness or even the mind.
                                            Alas, there is no direct english translation as the normal/original meaning
                                            could actually just be being obsessed with something, or even being
                                            possessed. Edit - using this term now, see next page for reasons.], Both of
                                            them stared in shock at Zhou Weiqing. With their own cultivation level, they
                                            could clearly feel that his Heavenly Energy was raging through his body
                                            wildly. “What… what’s going on?” Huyan Aobo’s face was red with urgent
                                            worry, almost charging forward to help. However, he was quickly held back by
                                            Feng Yu.</p>
