                                        <p>Originally, when they completed research and development on these throwing
                                            javelins, the goal was to reduce the Heavenly Energy expenditure of the
                                            Peerless Air Force. After all, though they were all Jewel Masters, their
                                            cultivation level was still not considered very high yet. Just maintaining
                                            flight with their Consolidated Wings alone was no small consumption. With
                                            these javelins, they could still ensure their killing power even while
                                            saving as much Heavenly Energy as possible.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, the large patch of black dots descending down upon the Kalise
                                            soldiers were naturally the javelins that had been thrown down. Their
                                            targets were simple - the Kalise Heavy Infantry and Heavy Cavalry in the
                                            front.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavy Infantry subconsciously reacted swiftly, raising the tower shields
                                            in their hands. As for the Heavy Cavalry, though their reactions were just
                                            as quick, they could only use the small round shields bound to their left
                                            hands.</p>
                                        <p>Throwing javelins down from a height of five hundred yards was definitely not
                                            the same as shooting arrows, and naturally accuracy suffered. However, one
                                            could not dismiss the fact of their sheer numbers! Two hundred javelins
                                            raining down, and the enemy formation was so tightly packed. Even if they
                                            wanted to miss, it would be extremely difficult.</p>
                                        <p>*Puu**Puu**Puu**Puu* A series of grating, harsh and horrific sounds rang out,
                                            along with screams of agony that were often cut off abruptly.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavy Infantry soldiers were relatively okay. Even facing such powerful
                                            javelins, their tower shields were barely able to hold on. Although the
                                            javelins were able to pierce through the shields, by the time they did so
                                            the remaining force was much smaller, with only the front titanium tip able
                                            to pierce through. Besides a few that were unlucky enough to have it land
                                            directly at their head and killing them, most of them only received minor
                                            injuries.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, for the Heavy Cavalry soldiers, misery befell them. The small round
                                            shields in their hands, how could they possibly withstand the javelins
                                            thrown from a height of five hundred yards! Clouds of bloody mist rose from
                                            the backs of the horses as the soldiers were lanced right through, some even
                                            piercing right through the human and deep into their warhorses.</p>
                                        <p>Although their heavy armour weighed at least twenty jin, with those
                                            terrifying javelins that were thrown from such a height, the armour was torn
                                            through like paper, not having any use at all.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, each of the Peerless Regiment Air Force soldiers were equipped
                                            with six throwing javelins, and after several volleys of such javelin rain,
                                            several dozens of Heavy Infantry soldiers had fallen, while the Heavy
                                            Cavalry was nearly wiped out.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, having prepared for this battle for so long, how could Zhou
                                            Weiqing still leave his men with only six throwing javelins? Out of the two
                                            hundred Peerless Air Force soldiers, there were at least ten Spatial Rings,
                                            filled with large numbers of javelins. From just a rough estimate, they had
                                            at least two thousand more.</p>
                                        <p>The owners of the rings did not even need to pass them to the other warriors,
                                            only needing to toss the javelins down as soon as they took them out of the
                                            Spatial Rings. The javelins would automatically fall down tip first, still
                                            resulting in the terrifying piercing effect.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing remained floating in midair. He was actually the busiest one of
                                            all. Right by his side, there was a member of the Peerless Air Force with
                                            one of the Spatial Rings, specially passing him javelins one after the
                                            other. In fact, the several dozen Heavy Infantry soldiers that had been
                                            killed were mostly all slain by him. He did not even need to use Heavenly
                                            Energy, just using his powerful natural strength and accuracy of throwing…
                                            how could their tower shields hold out against him?</p>
                                        <p>By the time the Kalise Empire soldiers advanced another two hundred yards,
                                            the two Battalions of Heavy Cavalry had been wiped out. More than a hundred
                                            Heavy Infantry soldiers had also lost their lives.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Zhou Weiqing stopped the others from wasting their javelins,
                                            ordering them to ‘gift’ their final throws to the mass of infantry behind.
                                            As for himself, after taking a few more lives of the Heavy Infantry
                                            soldiers, he gathered his Air Force to return to the city walls.</p>
                                        <p>Cheers erupted like a volcano’s explosion, all around the Crescent City
                                            walls. In just this burst of attacks, more than two thousand Kalise Empire
                                            soldiers had died. More importantly, most of those were the most elite and
                                            ‘expensive’ Heavy Cavalry soldiers! One could imagine the current expression
                                            on the Kalise Empire Army Commander.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, let us go again. Even if we just bring some rocks, we can smash those
                                            fellows to bits.” One of the Peerless Regiment soldiers said excitedly.</p>
                                        <p>A notion rose its head in Zhou Weiqing’s heart, but he shook his head and
                                            said: “No, all your Heavenly Energy is not sufficient. Especially when the
                                            load is too heavy, the expenditure of Heavenly Energy is just too huge for
                                            you. Hurry up and recover your Heavenly Energy. Prepare to start shooting. I
                                            want all of you to focus on the soldiers who are manning the siege weapons.
                                            Your goal is to stop them all before they reach five hundred yards from the
                                            city walls.”</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Regiment First Main Company was the strongest elites of the
                                            entire Regiment, and their members all had ranges absolutely accurate up to
                                            eight hundred yards. After Zhou Weiqing gave his orders and arranged
                                            everything, he immediately went to look for two massive rocks, grabbing them
                                            as he flew up into the skies once more.</p>
                                        <p>These rocks were part of a collection of fallen logs and rocks that were
                                            prepared for use in dealing with enemies who came closer. With that reminder
                                            from the Peerless Regiment soldier earlier, Zhou Weiqing flew up with the
                                            two giant rocks. Naturally, his targets now were the trebuchets.</p>
                                        <p>Soon, the Kalise soldiers below could only stare in shock as two trebuchets
                                            were just smashed into smithereens by the two giant rocks. It had to be
                                            known that they only had a total of eight trebuchets for this entire
                                            battle!</p>
                                        <p>However, when Zhou Weiqing returned to the city walls and rose again with
                                            another batch of rocks, he no longer had the opportunity to repeat his feat
                                            once again. The Kalise Empire powerhouses were not there just too look
                                            pretty, especially since most of them were not even from the Kalise Empire,
                                            but from the Bai Da Empire. This time, they worked together to block the
                                            falling rocks, protecting the trebuchets.</p>
                                        <p>Foiled once more, Zhou Weiqing could only return to the city walls. He was
                                            not at all excited by their achievements thus far, as he knew that this was
                                            only the beginning. The hidden aces that he had were slowly being flipped
                                            open, but the attack of the enemy was only just beginning.</p>
                                        <p>Just on this frontal assault on the south wall, the Kalise Empire still had
                                            at least twenty thousand soldiers. For just a small city, once their attack
                                            actually started, it would be wave after wave crashing against them.
                                            Furthermore, if the giant battering ram cart actually reached the gates, how
                                            long could the weak gates of the Crescent City hold out?</p>
                                        <p><i>Come then! </i>Zhou Weiqing yelled in his heart. At this moment, he
                                            suddenly thought about how the Kalise Empire had invaded his homeland, and
                                            how his father had fought to the end, almost sacrificing his life to Seal
                                            the Royal Palace. His eyes turned red slowly. The true battle was about to
                                            begin.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Regiment archers began to display their true strength. They
                                            began to focus on firing at those soldiers that were pushing the various
                                            siege weapons. At this point, they did not even need to use their
                                            Consolidated Bows, each using their personal longbows, causing the movement
                                            of the siege weapons to drop dramatically.</p>
                                        <p>However, the Kalise Empire commander also reacted quickly. They still had
                                            more than a thousand Heavy Infantry soldiers remaining, and they quickly
                                            stepped forward with their tower shields to protect the soldiers pushing the
                                            siege weapons. Once again, the siege weapons resumed their slow march
                                            towards the city walls.</p>
                                        <p>From the vision up on the city walls, at least fifty sets of sieging ladders
                                            were prepared right behind the rest of the siege weapons. Once they all
                                            reached the two hundred yard range, the true offense would begin.</p>
                                        <p>“Summon your Consolidated Bows. Fire!” Zhou Weiqing shouted angrily. The
                                            enemies had finally reached the five hundred yard range. At this moment, it
                                            was time to show another ace. It was imperative that these siege weapons
                                            were stopped!</p>
                                        <p>Once again, the Peerless Regiment soldiers showed their power. The
                                            Consolidated Bows sprang into existence one after the other in bright light.
                                            Soon, the earsplitting sounds rang out explosively as they fired as one.</p>
                                        <p>The tower shields of the Heavy Infantry truly had an amazing defense. Even
                                            with the explosive effect of the Consolidated Bows, they still weren’t able
                                            to destroy them with a single shot. However, the explosive effect was still
                                            stunning, able to knock them back or even send them flying.</p>
                                        <p>For a time, the Heavy Infantry soldiers at the front were under great
                                            pressure. The explosive power of the arrows caused their neat formation to
                                            stumble and be thrown into disarray. Furthermore, for some of the skilled
                                            Peerless Regiment archers, their Consolidated Bows did not have the
                                            explosive effect, instead with a powerful piercing effect. The arrows that
                                            these fired out were not stopped by the tower shields, each claiming a life
                                            upon hitting.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the defensive line that had been the sturdy bedrock of the
                                            Kalise soldiers finally suffered a catastrophic loss. With the Peerless
                                            Regiment soldiers no longer sparing their Heavenly Energy, the remaining
                                            thousand Heavy Infantry soldiers all perished by the time the formation
                                            reached the three hundred yard mark.</p>
                                        <p>Three hundred yards. At last, the Kalise Empire soldiers began to come into
                                            range to return fire as well, and a large number of arrows began flying up
                                            in an arc towards the city. In such a large scale battle, there weren’t many
                                            soldiers who could be as accurate in their archery as the Peerless Regiment
                                            soldiers. However, they just had too great of numbers, and they just needed
                                            to shoot upwards in an arc towards the Crescent City walls.</p>
                                        <p>A large patch of arrows fell upon them. The Peerless Regiment archers and
                                            Heavy Cavalry were naturally not afraid due to their armour, but for the
                                            ordinary soldiers, the injuries and death were starting to add up. Although
                                            they were all equipped with shields, they were after all still fresh
                                            recruits with minimal training! Facing such a battle, how could panic not
                                            ensue?</p>
                                        <p>*Bang**Boom**Bang**Boom* The ballista turrets on the walls also began their
                                            fire. One by one, the siege vehicles were smashed apart by the heavy bolts
                                            of the ballista. Although they weren’t as effective as Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            previous arrows, even down to killing the soldiers within, but at least the
                                            main goal of taking down the siege vehicles had been met. For a time, the
                                            death toll on the Kalise side continued rising higher.</p>
                                        <p>Out of the fifty siege vehicles at the start, the number which had actually
                                            reached the three hundred yard range now was only about twenty or so. Just
                                            from that alone, one could imagine how crazy the fight for the Crescent City
                                            had been thus far.</p>
                                        <p>However, by this point, a large majority of Zhou Weiqing’s hidden aces had
                                            already been revealed. Yet, there were still six more trebuchets, and they
                                            were closing in soon. The remaining siege weaponry were also reaching
                                            soon.</p>
                                        <p>This was especially so for the giant battering ram cart, the lumbering giant
                                            which seemed to be the next greatest threat soon. Those things were just too
                                            huge, and Zhou Weiqing had tried using a massive rock to smash one earlier,
                                            but it did not have a big effect. It seemed to difficult to destroy them
                                            outright. At this point, Zhou Weiqing did not dare to spend too much
                                            Heavenly Energy. After all, those Kalise Empire powerhouses were not to be
                                            trifled with, and when the actual onslaught began, they would charge forth
                                            as well. On his own side, there was only Lin TianAo and Xiao Yan who could
                                            help him deal with those powerhouses, so it could be said that the majority
                                            of enemies had to be dealt by Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>As such, standing on the city walls, Zhou Weiqing could only continuously
                                            fire arrows with his Overlord Bow at the Heavy Infantry soldiers, not even
                                            using much Heavenly Energy. At such a range, even his ordinary arrows were
                                            not so easily blocked.</p>
                                        <p>It wasn’t just the Heavy Infantry soldiers who suffered. Even some of the
                                            Kalise powerhouses who tried to charge forward were sent on a retreat by
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s Overlord Bow.</p>
                                        <p>Since the fight had already reached such a point, it was already infinitely
                                            close to the most savage and ruthless point, hand to hand combat. It wasn’t
                                            just the frontal south wall though, all the other three walls of the
                                            Crescent city were also facing the frenzied attacks of their respective
                                            enemies.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, this Crescent City was just the first stop in Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            revival of his Empire, and just like a boat in the torrential winds of the
                                            fifty thousand Kalise Empire armies, on the verge of capsizing at
                                            anytime.</p>
