                                        <p>Lin TianAo thought for a moment, then said: “If I do not have to fight again
                                            today, five days of rest should be sufficient. I was fully prepared for the
                                            blow, and his sword was weakened by my Illusory Shield and Stoneskin Armor,
                                            and I positioned it so there isn’t any serious injuries. However, if this
                                            was not a tournament and a real fight in the open, it would be extremely
                                            difficult for me to take him. In such a scenario, even if I beat him, I
                                            would have to pay a heavy price. Weiqing, what do you think?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing understood what he was asking about, and said with a bitter
                                            smile: “I’m really unable to tell at this point. As per my plan, the real
                                            test for us will be whether or not we can take the third victory.”</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the judge called out: “Both sides, please send your second
                                            member onto the stage now.”</p>
                                        <p>The members of the Fei Li Battle Team all turned to Little Four, while he in
                                            turn looked towards Zhou Weiqing. Without question, Zhou Weiqing’s plan was
                                            still in motion; despite the difficulty he faced, Lin TianAo had managed to
                                            pull of the win. This was definitely a great boost in morale to the entire
                                            team, and gave them more confidence in Zhou Weiqing’s entire strategy.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked towards Little Four with a serious expression, saying:
                                            “Bro Four, as I mentioned, you might be meeting their second strongest
                                            member in their team, and it will be an extremely tough fight. However,
                                            despite that, it is still a very important fight for us. Your task will be
                                            to make use of guerilla tactics, to make full use of your speed to stall the
                                            opponent. Your main task here is to ensure that your opponent uses up as
                                            much Heavenly Energy as possible, to ensure that he is unable to join the
                                            2v2 match. If possible, try not to clash directly with him or her.”</p>
                                        <p>To be able to represent the Fei Li Battle Team in the Heavenly Jewel Master,
                                            each of them were outstanding in their own right, perhaps even geniuses.
                                            Even though Zhou Weiqing did not elaborate further, Little Four quickly
                                            understood the gravity of his task. “Understood. I will do my best.”</p>
                                        <p>Turning around, Little Four walked out of the Rest House towards the stage.
                                            As he did so, he saw his opponent walk out from the nearby Dan Dun Battle
                                            Team Rest House as well.</p>
                                        <p>His opponent was a youth of about 26 or 27 years of age, standing tall and
                                            straight. His height was almost equal to Zhou Weiqing, but not as well
                                            built. His features were average, but had an air about him that made him
                                            seem approachable. However, if one looked closely, they might see a hint of
                                            a darkness hidden deep in his eyes, and could possibly give one an
                                            uncomfortable feeling.</p>
                                        <p>The youth did not even look at Little Four, instead stepping into the air as
                                            if just strolling casually onto the stage.</p>
                                        <p>Little Four’s heart gripped slightly, and he couldn’t help but feel impressed
                                            by Zhou Weiqing’s estimations. Evidently, this youth was much more powerful
                                            than Lan Feng previously.</p>
                                        <p>Little Four also strode up the stage slowly, and under the judge’s
                                            instructions, both sides introduced themselves.</p>
                                        <p>“Fei Li Battle Team, Xiao Si.” Little Four’s original name was indeed Xiao
                                            Si[1. Different Xiao (肖四）instead of 小四, which means little four], but his
                                            close friends all called him Little Four instead.</p>
                                        <p>“Dan Dun Battle Team, Han Bing.” The youth spoke crisply and simply. At this
                                            time, the two were looking at each other, and Little Four did not see any
                                            emotions in Han Bing’s eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Below the stage, in the Dan Dun Resting House, Lan Feng returned with a vexed
                                            look on his face, saying to the young lady: “Leader, I am truly not
                                            satisfied, I cannot accept that loss.”</p>
                                        <p>The young lady looked at him coldly. “What do you have to be dissatisfied
                                            about? Do you know why you lost?”</p>
                                        <p>Without hesitation, Lan Feng said: “I was too careless, and fell into his
                                            trap.”</p>
                                        <p>The young lady shook her head, saying: “No, you’re wrong. You lost because of
                                            the difference in power. In terms of absolute strength, he is definitely
                                            much more powerful than you… Even if Han Bing were to fight him, it would be
                                            very close, and even a victory would take a heavy toll. That man’s defense
                                            is much higher than you think. If not for the fact that your speed counters
                                            his type, you would have lost in a much worse fashion.”</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the look of disbelief on Lan Feng’s face, she continued. “Battle
                                            experience and strategy is also part of one’s power. Even if there wasn’t
                                            the restrictions of the tournament rules, you would still lose in the end,
                                            though perhaps you might give him some more problems. That man’s character…
                                            His tenacity… And his power… It is a perfect match, and he is definitely an
                                            outstanding talent. For a person with no Great Saint Lands background, to be
                                            able to reach such a level before the age of thirty, that is already an
                                            unbelievable feat.”</p>
                                        <p>As she spoke up to this point, she paused, then said in a gentler tone. “Lan
                                            Feng, you do not need to feel so vexed. After all, you are a lot younger
                                            than he is. Furthermore, if I am not wrong, he is the Leader of the Fei Li
                                            Battle Team, and most likely their strongest member as well. Losing that
                                            fight… Will not affect the final result for us.”</p>
                                        <p>Lan Feng nodded, his expression finally clearing up, and he said: “Priest
                                            will take revenge for me.” Han Bing’s nickname in the Dan Dun Battle Team
                                            was Priest, and they often called him that instead, sometimes even calling
                                            him Frost Priest. [2. His name Han Bing 寒冰 literally means cold ice. His
                                            nickname (祭祀) was a little harder, literally meaning Sacrifice to the Gods.
                                            I translated the entire nickname / title as Frost Priest]</p>
                                        <p>The Blood Red Hell was one of the weaker of the Great Saint Lands, and in
                                            terms of overall strength they were only slightly stronger than the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect. In fact, in terms of comparing their highest level of
                                            powerhouses, the top echelons of the Heavenly Demon Sect were even stronger
                                            than them! As such, in order to achieve a good result in the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament and ensure they could enter the highly important Heavenly Jewel
                                            Island, they had sent some of their top talents in the younger generation;
                                            amongst them, both Han Bing and the young lady leader were considered the
                                            cream of the crop.</p>
                                        <p>The Five Great Saint Lands could not directly enter the Tournament, but in
                                            truth it was just a matter of naming. When representing the Empires they
                                            did, as long as they didn’t use the top power of their Great Saint Lands, it
                                            was still not easy to tell. After all, it was easy for a powerful Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master to hide their true strength should they chose to do so.</p>
                                        <p>As such, the entire Dan Dun Battle Team team had absolute confidence in Frost
                                            Priest taking this fight. Even if Lin TianAo were to face him, they was
                                            barely a thirty percent chance of victory, perhaps even only a ten percent
                                            chance, let alone the other members of the Fei Li Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>As the judge proclaimed the start of the fight, Little Four instantly felt a
                                            huge pressure upon him. He could clearly see that with a wave of his hands,
                                            Han Bing’s Heavenly Jewels appeared, and six red Physical Jewel appeared
                                            around his wrist.</p>
                                        <p>The Red Jade Physical Jewel represented the Coordination Attribute, but that
                                            was not the focus of Little Four’s attention; naturally, it was the number
                                            of Jewels that worried him.</p>
                                        <p>In all the twenty four Battle Teams that had fought so far, the highest
                                            cultivation level was Five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters. Any team who had
                                            one was already considered above average, and those with two or more was
                                            already considered extremely powerful. The Bai Da Battle Team had been such
                                            a case. In fact, about half the teams did not have a single Five-Jeweled
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master!</p>
                                        <p>Yet, the four Great Saint Lands showed their true power, not just in terms of
                                            their combat experience and fighting abilities, but even the superiority of
                                            their cultivation level. Han Bing was one such example indeed. He was an
                                            Upper Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master with six sets of Heavenly
                                            Jewels!</p>
                                        <p>For Heavenly Jewel Masters, each set of Jewels was a massive difference in
                                            power levels. It wasn’t just the difference in Heavenly Energy, quality of
                                            it, as well as the number of skills and even the strength of the skills!</p>
                                        <p>Of course, those monsters like Zhou Weiqing who ‘broke’ such ‘rules’ existed,
                                            but were extremely rare. After all, the majority of Heavenly Jewel Masters
                                            only had a single Elemental attribute, and their Skills were thus extremely
                                            limited.</p>
                                        <p>Six Jewels versus Five Jewels, under any ordinary circumstances, the
                                            Six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master would have more than a seventy percent
                                            chance of winning. That was even so under the assumption that both had equal
                                            experience and normal combat skills. As for Six Jewels versus Four Jewels,
                                            ordinarily the Four Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master would have no chance at
                                            all.</p>
                                        <p>Han Bing looked coldly at Little Four, and as soon as the fight started, he
                                            lifted his right hand, and a red staff appeared in his hands.</p>
                                        <p>The staff looked as if it was crafted from red coral, glimmering with a
                                            brilliant crystalline light. What was shocking to Little Four was that on
                                            the tip of the staff, there were three sockets!</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, there was no mistake. Three sockets.</p>
                                        <p>For a Consolidated Equipment to have three sockets, its scroll had to be
                                            created by a Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Master or higher. This youth
                                            was truly worthy of being one of the top talents of a Great Saint Lands, and
                                            as soon as the fight started, he showed off some of his terrifying
                                            power.</p>
                                        <p>Three resplendent Elemental Jewels immediately filled the sockets. Han Bing
                                            did not even bother to use any other Consolidated Equipment or skills, and
                                            the three Star Sapphire Elemental Jewels of his shone from the staff, adding
                                            to its brilliance. An icy blue colour formed a shield of light, enveloping
                                            his entire body.</p>
                                        <p>Little Four’s combat experience was not to be underestimated, and he could
                                            instantly tell that the powerful shield of light was not one of the Skills
                                            from the Socketed Elemental Jewels, but rather one of the automatic
                                            abilities of the staff when the three sockets were filled with Elemental
                                            Jewels.</p>
                                        <p>Han Bing’s nickname was Priest, and his expertise was mid-long ranged combat.
                                            Lifting his staff, thirty six blue spots of light appeared outside his blue
                                            shield of light. In the next instant, they all sped towards Little Four from
                                            all directions, as if blotting out the very atmosphere.</p>
                                        <p>It was thirty six ice cones. Silent, deadly, bringing with it a swift cold
                                            wind.</p>
                                        <p>Cone of Cold, or ice cones, was not a particularly powerful Skill amongst the
                                            Water Attribute Skills, with only a four star rating. Yet, it had one
                                            benefit, the number of ice cones created. Even a one-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master was able to release six ice cones when using the Skill.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of explosive power, the ice cones were definitely unable to compare
                                            to fireballs. However, their strength was in their piercing power. More
                                            importantly, with a nickname like Frost Priest, the ice cones that Han Bing
                                            released were no ordinary ones!</p>
                                        <p>As the thirty six ice cones appeared, Little Four felt as if his breathing
                                            was being smothered, almost suffocating, as the temperature in the air
                                            dropped dramatically. Although Han Bing did not release any other supporting
                                            Skills, just the presence of the ice cones alone actually caused the
                                            temperature of the entire surrounding air to drop, almost like Ye Paopao’s
                                            Freezing Field skill! This would also reduce his opponent’s speed and
                                            reaction.</p>
                                        <p>The thirty six ice cones were not white, but blue, as if they were blue
                                            crystals. At this point, the very skies seemed to turn overcast as the ice
                                            cones hovered in the air, causing a brilliant contrast as compared to the
                                            gloomy skies.</p>
                                        <p>Little Four could sense that those ice cones were definitely powerful, almost
                                            deadly, and he could not judge them like any ordinary Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master’s Cone of Cold. Not only were they cast by someone like Han Bing,
                                            Six-Jeweled, and with his own understanding, control and compressed
                                            improvement of the skill, it was also highly boosted by the staff in Han
                                            Bing’s hands. The ice cones were clearly much smaller than the ordinary ice
                                            cones produced by the usual Cone of Cold.</p>
                                        <p>Remembering Zhou Weiqing’s instructions, Little Four did not attempt to take
                                            the attacks head on. As soon as Han Bing released the staff and the shield
                                            of light, Little Four’s body was already speeding backwards in a hasty
                                            retreat. At the same time as he did so, he released his Consolidated
                                            Equipment Wings, though he did not release any of his offensive Consolidated
                                            Equipment.</p>
