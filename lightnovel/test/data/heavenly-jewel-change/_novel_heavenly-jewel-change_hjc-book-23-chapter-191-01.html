                                            victory in hand, they could not possibly lose. Furthermore, so what if they
                                            really lost? Would they really be that disadvantaged in the negotiations?
                                            That would also have to see who was on the other end. After all, do not
                                            forget what our dear Zhou Little Fatty was best at? Would he really care too
                                            much about the winning or losing of this current bet?</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai was also looking at Zhou Weiqing. Just like how Zhou Weiqing felt a
                                            sense of high respect and esteem for her, she had also a fresh new appraisal
                                            of the youth in front of her. From the start of Cai Cai’s performance in
                                            turning the tide, Zhou Weiqing had stood there without any movement, just
                                            silently watching her as if he were just a bystander, as if he did not care
                                            about any of this.</p>
                                        <p>As she spoke, Cai Cai had kept her focus on Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, but she was
                                            quickly disappointed. She was totally unable to read anything within them.
                                            Indeed, nothing at all. There was only a gentle smiling intent in there, as
                                            if he was reuniting with an old friend. Towards that previous victory, there
                                            was no pride or arrogance, as if it was just an ordinary thing for a
                                            six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master like himself to defeat a nine-Jeweled
                                            powerhouse.</p>
                                        <p>More and more, Cai Cai was starting to ratify Ming Yu’s judgement. This Zhou
                                            Weiqing was truly not any ordinary person. Was he really less than twenty
                                            years of age?!</p>
                                        <p>However, this was clearly not the time to think too deeply into things. After
                                            a short time pondering, Cai Cai showed an apologetic look, saying: “For the
                                            sake of the Empire’s honour, I might have to let Commander Zhou suffer some
                                            slight trouble. Principal Huo Feng, would you please?” As she spoke, she
                                            inclined her body slightly, making an inviting gesture to her back.</p>
                                        <p>A tall and thin old man walked out slowly towards Cai Cai’s side, bowing
                                            slightly. He smiled faintly as he said: “I’m happy to be of service, Your
                                            Highness.”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai laughed heartily and said: “You flatter me, we are all working for
                                            the glory of the Empire. I had no choice but to invite Principal to
                                            intervene, please forgive me.”</p>
                                        <p>Seeing this person, Zhou Weiqing was startled in his heart. He knew that Cai
                                            Cai was going all out now. This old man in front of him did not seem to have
                                            much Heavenly Energy reverberations around him, but the instant that he had
                                            appeared, Zhou Weiqing had sensed a powerful threat. This was not a person
                                            he could handle alone… which could only mean one thing… this old man called
                                            Huo Feng was a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had not imagined that in the welcoming party of Princess Cai
                                            Cai, there would be someone like this here. In an instant, a wary look
                                            entered his eyes, but he did not have any notion of backing down.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai nodded apologetically to Zhou Weiqing and said: “Commander Zhou, in
                                            this second round, we will be sending Principal Huo Feng to act on our
                                            behalf. You should have heard of Principal Huo Feng right, he is in charge
                                            of the Fei Li Heavenly Jewel Academy.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing the introduction, only then did Zhou Weiqing understand. So this old
                                            man was actually the Principal of the Heavenly Jewel Academy… that was to
                                            say, he was Xiao Yan and Lin TianAo’s teacher! No wonder his presence was so
                                            strong. In that moment, Zhou Weiqing’s brow furrowed, and he turned to look
                                            at Lin TianAo.</p>
                                        <p>Both Lin TianAo and Xiao Yan’s face were strange, and they exchanged looks
                                            momentarily before stepping forward. Stopping behind Zhou Weiqing, they
                                            bowed towards Huo Feng.</p>
                                        <p>Xiao Yan said respectfully: “Teacher.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo also greeted him with Principal. As the two of them bowed,
                                            naturally the aura and momentum of Zhou Weiqing’s side dropped, while for
                                            the Fei Li Empire’s side, though they had dropped previously from Shen
                                            Wang’s loss, a large amount was regained.</p>
                                        <p>This Cai Cai must have done this on purpose! That was Zhou Weiqing’s first
                                            thought. His thoughts were indeed true; after all, how could Cai Cai not
                                            know Lin TianAo and Xiao Yan’s origin? Furthermore, ever since Zhou Weiqing
                                            and the Fei Li Battle Team had achieved victory in the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament, Cai Cai had researched them all closely. Currently, sending out
                                            Huo Feng was a way of savagely beating down on the Heavenly Bow Empire’s
                                            morale.</p>
                                        <p>Huo Feng swept his gaze past the two of them before saying passively: “I am
                                            not worthy of such greetings. Since you both have already chosen to join the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire, you are no longer part of the Fei Li Empire. The title
                                            of teacher, I am no longer worthy of it.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo was still fine; after all he had not been personally taught by Huo
                                            Feng. However, for Xiao Yan, upon hearing such words, he instantly knelt
                                            down on the ground, his head down as he was unable to say anything.</p>
                                        <p>A cold light flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, but he did not blame Lin TianAo
                                            or Xiao Yan. As the saying goes, one day as a Master, forever like a Father.
                                            If he were in their shoes, he would react the same way.</p>
                                        <p>After a pause, Zhou Weiqing sighed and said: “For this round, we admit
                                            defeat.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Cai Cai smiled faintly, an expression of ‘as
                                            should be the case’ flashing across her face. Nodding to Zhou Weiqing, she
                                            said: “Very well, then for the third round, Commander Zhou please direct
                                            us.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at Cai Cai coldly. Although he wanted to call her
                                            despicable, but in the end he did not say anything. This was after all a
                                            tactic, and if they could win, then it was a good tactic. In a clash between
                                            Empires, there was nothing more important than winning, and he knew that
                                            very well.</p>
                                        <p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Very well, for this
                                            third round, I would like to learn from your Empire regarding a clash
                                            between armies. As Your Highness has seen, we have seven hundred soldiers
                                            here with us in our party. How about you all send out seven hundred troops
                                            and we can have a good group fight? Of course, it will just be a duel, and
                                            we can cover all our weapons with thick cloth to ensure no serious injuries.
                                            We’ll see who can knock out more opponents to decide the victor. What do you
                                            think?”</p>
                                        <p>Similarly, Cai Cai did not hesitate to agree, instantly nodding as she said:
                                            “Very well, then we shall meet again on the drilling ground. However, it
                                            will take some time for us to prepare that many thick cotton cloths.
                                            Commander Zhou, you and your soldiers can have a rest first. Once we prepare
                                            everything, we can begin the third round.”</p>
                                        <p>As both sides separated for the time being, Cai Cai returned to the VIP
                                            Stage. Once she was seated again, she immediately turned to one of her
                                            personal guards and said solemnly: “Quick, go invite General Ming Yu here,
                                            ask him to bring his personal guard.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes Ma’am!”</p>
                                        <p>As for Zhou Weiqing, he returned to the Peerless Battalion side. Lin TianAo
                                            and Xiao Yan had their heads down, a shamed look on their faces. They knew
                                            that it was for their sakes that Zhou Weiqing had admitted defeat.</p>
                                        <p>It was still relatively okay for Xiao Yan; after all, in his eyes, although
                                            Zhou Weiqing was strong, but a Heavenly King Stage was a huge difference
                                            from a Upper Level Zong Stage. He did not think that Zhou Weiqing could
                                            defeat a Heavenly King stage powerhouse right?</p>
                                        <p>However, Lin TianAo knew that for the second round, they definitely had a
                                            chance to win. For the Fei Li Empire to send out a Heavenly King Stage
                                            powerhouse, they could definitely respond with not just a single person, to
                                            make it a fair fight. If Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er and Shangguan Xue’er joined
                                            forces against Principal Huo Feng, or even just two of them, it would not be
                                            easy to tell who would end up the final victor.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gathered his officers to him, saying solemnly: “In this next
                                            round, we can only win. Try not to kill anyone, as long as we win it is
                                            fine. This time, I will personally command the soldiers.”</p>
                                        <p>Everyone quickly agreed, especially Lin TianAo and Xiao Yan. Their eyes were
                                            filled with resolution. They had been the cause of the previous loss, and
                                            this time, they would want to make up for that loss.</p>
                                        <p>After speaking to his soldiers for a while and encouraging them simply for
                                            morale, Zhou Weiqing sat to the side, lapsing deep into thought. Towards
                                            this third round, he was absolutely confident in victory. Let alone the Fei
                                            Li Empire, even if the ZhongTian Empire wanted to find a group of seven
                                            hundred who could defeat the seven hundred elite soldiers he had with him,
                                            it would be extremely difficult. Towards this second victory, he was
                                            determined to get it.</p>
                                        <p>However, the key was the final two rounds, and that was what he was pondering
                                            about. If they won this third round, then the fourth round would be
                                            determined by their opponent. If they lost that round, then the fifth round
                                            would once again fall to his choice. In that case, what could he use that
                                            would be a guaranteed victory?</p>
                                        <p>As he thought up to that point, Zhou Weiqing subconsciously looked back at
                                            his own camp. All of a sudden, a strange smile appeared on his lips.</p>
                                        <p>After Cai Cai returned to the VIP stage, she had also ordered her men to
                                            start preparing a large number of thick cloths. At the same time, she also
                                            lapsed into thought. Without question, it was regarding this current ‘three
                                            out of five’ competition. This third round could be said to be the most
                                            important round. After all, since Zhou Weiqing had won the first round, he
                                            had a competitive advantage. However, if they could actually seize the third
                                            round instead, the advantage would be theirs.</p>
                                        <p>He has chosen a group fight… clearly he has much confidence in his seven
                                            hundred soldiers. However, even if they are from the ZhongTian Empire, so
                                            what? Ming Yu’s personal guards have gone through hell and back, climbing
                                            out from piles of dead bodies. Added on to the fact that it was the Fei Li
                                            God General personally commanding them, she could not believe a youth like
                                            Zhou Weiqing without much battlefield experience could possibly win.</p>
                                        <p>After all, Zhou Weiqing had never been known for his strategy and tactics…
                                            even when he was studying in the Fei Li Military Academy, he had not
                                            participated much in classes…</p>
                                        <p>However, just like how Ming Yu had appraised Zhou Weiqing when he first met
                                            him, although in terms of specific tactics or strategy Zhou Weiqing was not
                                            outstanding, but he had a quality no one else could match. An unbelievably
                                            acute senses, judgement and a soaring imagination that was wild and
                                            unmatched.</p>
                                        <p>It was exactly because of this unique quality that had allowed him to build
                                            such a force like the Peerless Battalion in less than two years!</p>
                                        <p>As orders were given out, Zhou Weiqing’s expression was relaxed and easy
                                            going. If the Peerless Battalion could lose to a mere fight against equal
                                            odds, then he could just give up on trying to revive his Empire now.
                                            Furthermore, no matter what tactics or strategy, facing absolute strength,
                                            what use was it? So what if he was not well versed in those traditional
                                            strategies and tactics? As long as he knew how to flourish their own
                                            strength, that was more than sufficient.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Almost an hour passed before the large number of cloths had been gathered and
                                            sent to the drilling ground. At the same time, a large troop of soldiers had
                                            also silently entered the zone, arraying into formation under the cover of
                                            the Royal Family Cavalry.</p>
