                                            away. The sword pierced the chest of the Demonic Emperor in almost an
                                            instant. </p>
                                        <p>The Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor did not try to hide the ferocious look in
                                            his eyes. The tyrannical Destruction aura accumulated within his sword. He
                                            had absolute confidence that there was absolutely no way that Wu Yunyue
                                            could block his attack. In reality, he had been pretending to be weaker than
                                            he actually was within the battle earlier. If Wu Yunyue had launched a
                                            simple attack, perhaps he would have drained Wu Yunyue to a certain point
                                            before admitting defeat. However, Wu Yunyue’s attack was filled with killing
                                            intent and thoroughly angered him. Hence, he had completely disregarded
                                            Huang Xingyun’s orders and took the opportunity to defeat the Demonic God
                                            before his eyes with one blow. Based on his Heavenly Emperor Stage
                                            cultivation base, as long as the sword, that was filled with highly
                                            concentrated Destruction Energy, pierced Wu Yunyue’s body, the Destruction
                                            Energy would explode within his body. It would not only cause Wu Yunyue’s
                                            body to be instantly destroyed, under the protection of the Time Attribute,
                                            it would not even leave a single trace.</p>
                                        <p>A loud exploding sound was heard and resonated through the entire area, to
                                            the extent that the entire Heavenly Snow Mountain could hear it clearly.
                                            Immediately after, blood red light appeared in the sky and two black figures
                                            descended to the ground. The initial distorted light had also scattered in
                                            an instant.</p>
                                        <p>Two thuds were heard - two parts of a body were thrown to the ground of the
                                            mountain peak, following the rain of blood.</p>
                                        <p>Everyone was dumbstruck. Immediately after, they could recognize that the
                                            corpse that fell onto the ground was that of the Passion Valley Heavenly
                                            Emperor.</p>
                                        <p>His body had been severed from his left hip all the way to his right
                                            shoulder. It was a clean and magnificent cut - the dense Heavenly Energy of
                                            the Evil Attribute could be seen wreaking havoc on the inside of the two
                                            halves of the body, further destroying the Heavenly Emperor’s tough body.
                                            Within the time frame of several blinks of an eye, they were completely
                                            destroyed beyond recognition.</p>
                                        <p><em>What happened?</em> Everyone asked themselves that question. Even though
                                            Wu Yunyue had the upper hand earlier, when the Passion Valley Heavenly
                                            Emperor used the Time Mirror Image to evade his fatal attack, he had already
                                            managed to turn things around and got the upper hand! Even if he could not
                                            win against Wu Yunyue, it was not possible for victory and defeat to be
                                            determined in such a short period of time. </p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Wu Yunyue had already descended to the ground. On the
                                            surface, he looked completely unharmed. However, the middle finger of his
                                            left hand, that was hiding in his sleeve, was completely swollen. At least
                                            within a short period of time, he was unable to use it during a battle. </p>
                                        <p>Even though the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor was dead, his eyes were still
                                            wide open, with a look of disbelief in them. Wu Yunyue looked coldly at him
                                            - his powerful aura had become even denser.</p>
                                        <p>Only Wu Yunyue himself knew what exactly happened. The loud sound that
                                            resounded the air earlier was the sound of Wu Yunyue’s middle finger
                                            flicking the sharp end of the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor’s sword that
                                            was filled with Destruction Energy. </p>
                                        <p>Just like that, the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor’s full-force attack got
                                            flicked away by Wu Yunyue. He had already fully focused his entire attention
                                            on that attack, channeling all his Heavenly Energy into that sword - how
                                            could he have expected his attack to fail that easily? Naturally, he was
                                            unable to dodge Wu Yunyue’s sword, and ended up getting his body severed
                                            into two. </p>
                                        <p>Wu Yunyue looked at Zhou Weiqing. Both of them momentarily exchanged glances
                                            and Zhou Weiqing could roughly guess what had happened. On the other hand,
                                            Huang Xingyun stared gloomily at Wu Yunyue, as though he was going to attack
                                            him at any moment.</p>
                                        <p>The Demonic Emperor shot him a disdainful look. Just as he was about to say
                                            something, Zhou Weiqing was already standing next to him with an apologetic
                                            look on his face and said, “Valley Master Huang, I am deeply sorry. Our
                                            Deputy Sect Leader had slipped up and was unable to show mercy. Alas,
                                            battles between Heavenly Emperors are indeed tragic and violent! Valley
                                            Master Huang, please do not take this personally. It is the Grand Tournament
                                            after all, injury and death cannot be avoided.”</p>
                                        <p>Huang Xingyun looked at Zhou Weiqing’s apologetic face and clenched his teeth
                                            in anger so hard that it almost crushed them to pieces. He replied, “Fine.
                                            Good on you, Peerless Sect. Wu Yunyue, I hope you can keep going like
                                            this.”</p>
                                        <p>Because of Zhou Weiqing’s arrival, Wu Yunyue appeared to be a lot more calm.
                                            He said indifferently, “If you are not convinced, you should step into the
                                            arena yourself. However, if you want to go against me, you still have to
                                            wait. Next.” </p>
                                        <p> “After you, Demonic Emperor.” After the Passion Valley was naturally the
                                            powerhouse from the Blood Red Hell. The next participant sent by Fen Tian
                                            was still a Heavenly Emperor. However, at this moment, Fen Tian was
                                            furrowing his brows. He looked pensively at the Demonic Emperor Wu
                                            Yunyue.</p>
                                        <p>Without a doubt, from the start of the Grand Tournament till now, the
                                            individual with the most eye-catching performance was the Demonic Emperor Wu
                                            Yunyue, the represent of the Peerless Sect. He was the only person who
                                            survived the first cycle of the first round. Even though this was directly
                                            related to Zhou Weiqing’s success in the earlier drawing of lots, Wu Yunyue
                                            had defeated two opponents in succession, and he was the only person who had
                                            won two battles. Particularly the last battle - he managed to emerge
                                            victorious against the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor within a very short
                                            period of time and even ruthlessly killed him off, causing the atmosphere of
                                            the Grand Tournament to become very tense.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, even though Wu Yunyue’s performance was powerful, at least for
                                            now, everything was deemed acceptable in the eyes of the other four Saint
                                            Lands. After all, Wu Yunyue was the leader of one of the five Great Saint
                                            Lands. In the previous Grand Tournaments, he was the last to step into the
                                            arena. It was entirely normal for him to be more powerful than ordinary
                                            participants. Conversely, it was unexpected that Yun Ruoyu of the Passion
                                            Valley was easily defeated in the first round. </p>
                                        <p>Two figures soared up into the sky once again. The powerhouses of all five
                                            Great Saint Lands were watching from below with a different attitude. The
                                            people who were paying the most attention were naturally Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Fen Tian. Looking at the two powerhouses soaring up into the sky, Zhou
                                            Weiqing looked smilingly at Fen Tian and said, “I wonder when you will be
                                            stepping into the arena, Hell Lord! If you keep sending your subordinates
                                            out, I’m afraid the Blood Red Hell might not be able to stay in the Grand
                                            Tournament for long.”</p>
                                        <p>Fen Tian looked indifferently at Zhou Weiqing and replied, “The Grand
                                            Tournament has just begun, isn’t it too early for you to be making such
                                            statements, Sect Leader Zhou? Even though Wu Yunyue may be powerful, it is
                                            impossible him to stay in there for too long. Don’t tell me that you think
                                            he still stand a chance to win against me?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, “Of course not. It’s just that I have heard of your
                                            great name for a long time, Lord Fen Tian. I was only wondering if I will
                                            get the chance to fight against you in this Grand Tournament, and wanted to
                                            get some advice from you. How unfortunate.”</p>
                                        <p> “What is unfortunate?” Fen Tian looked at the regretful-looking Zhou Weiqing
                                            with curiosity. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled once again, “I am only saying that it is unfortunate
                                            that there are so many powerhouses in the Blood Red Hell. I wonder how many
                                            of them are able to leave this place alive!”</p>
                                        <p> “You are courting death.” Immediately, the powerhouses standing behind Fen
                                            Tian were furious, and were about to charge out. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked frightened, “Eek, don’t tell me that because you can’t
                                            win us in Grand Tournament, you are going to go against the rules and attack
                                            us? I am terrified! Bring it on!”</p>
                                        <p>Even though Zhou Weiqing’s voice was not loud, but every single person on the
                                            peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain was a powerhouse. Naturally, they could
                                            hear what he said clearly. A majority of them stiffened up their faces. The
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian and Shangguan Tianyue turned their
                                            heads, pretending they did not know who this jackass was.</p>
                                        <p>The battle in the sky had already begun. Compared to the last two battles, it
                                            was as though Wu Yunyue had gone wild from taking some medication. He kept
                                            the Demonic Transformation and the Demonic Emperor Set on. He had harbored
                                            strong hatred towards the Blood Red Hell for the longest time. The moment
                                            when both of them soared into the air, he had launched an attack that was
                                            equivalent to a raging storm on him. </p>
                                        <p>In mid-air, the shade of gray that was filled with the aura of the Evil
                                            Attribute covered the entire sky. The tyrannical Evil Attribute was
                                            suppressing his opponent, akin to Mountain Tai. It seemed as though Wu
                                            Yunyue had completely disregarded the consumption of his energy. The crazy
                                            attack rendered the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor powerless and unable to
                                            retaliate. The Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis and the Sword of the Demonic
                                            Emperor caused the heaven and earth to change in color every time he
                                            attacked. </p>
                                        <p>Even though the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor was not weak, and the moment
                                            he soared into the sky he had already unleashed the Destruction Attribute,
                                            he was still of a lower cultivation base compared to Wu Yunyue. Most
                                            importantly, the Destruction Attribute that he released had absolutely no
                                            effect on Wu Yunyue’s Evil and Life Attributes. It was as though he was only
                                            relying on the Fire Attribute to fight against Wu Yunyue.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the situation in the sky, Fen Tian furrowed his brows. However,
                                            from his eyes, it seemed as though he had a sudden realization and he
                                            casually glanced over at the Passion Valley. He happened to see the Valley
                                            Master Huang Xingyun looking over at him and the both of them felt the
                                            chills within each other’s eyes as they exchanged glances.</p>
                                        <p>It was momentary and only a few people managed to notice the changes in the
                                            eyes of the Saint Land leaders.</p>
                                        <p>Wu Yunyue’s attacks were absolutely too powerful. Under the Demonic
                                            Transformation, as a Max Level Heavenly Emperor, he had total control. Every
                                            attack of the Sword of the Demonic Emperor was at full power, showing
                                            absolutely no mercy at all. Furthermore, his Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis
                                            continuously launched attacks at his opponent in all directions. Under such
                                            circumstances, the thought of using the Heavenly Skill Image was nothing but
                                            a dream. </p>
                                        <p>The main reason why Wu Yunyue could kill off the Passion Valley Heavenly
                                            Emperor at the very last moment was because of the Saint Energy channeled
                                            into his body by Zhou Weiqing. Relying on the Saint Energy, he no longer had
                                            a restraining fear towards the Destruction Attribute. Otherwise, at the last
                                            moment, he could’ve only chosen to dodge the attack and would not have been
                                            able to successfully kill off his opponent. </p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Fen Tian had clearly realized this. However, what could he
                                            possibly do with that information? It was not a secret that Zhou Weiqing
                                            possessed the Saint Energy. Right now, all he found out was that Zhou
                                            Weiqing could channel the Saint Energy to another person.</p>
                                        <p> “Go to hell.” The Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor was continuously being
                                            suppressed, and his eyes were already red with killing intent. Suddenly, his
                                            entire body became a shade of dense black and his weapon was a long saber.
                                            In that instant, the overbearing Destruction Attribute had completely
                                            vanished. His long saber swung, as though it was splitting heaven and earth
                                            apart, and a black crescent-shaped light passed through the saber, charging
                                            towards Wu Yunyue. </p>
