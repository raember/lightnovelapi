                                            up his sleeve that he had not used. If this was not the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain and he could unleash his full power, he still thought he had some
                                            chance of fighting against Long Shiya. He did have the Divine Attribute
                                            after all.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, on the top of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, there was now four
                                            of the strongest powerhouses in the entire Boundless Mainland. One Heavenly
                                            God and three Heavenly Emperors! These four were not only terrifying
                                            presences who could awe the lands, they were also some of the strongest in
                                            the entire land.</p>
                                        <p>No one dared approach to be an onlooker, no matter how tempting that might
                                            be. This was the Heavenly Snow Mountain… the Heavenly Snow Castle! Even the
                                            various tribe leaders that had come to celebrate the wedding dared not move
                                            out, fearing that they might annoy or anger the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord,
                                            and cause trouble for their entire tribe.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian smiled faintly at Long Shiya and said: “Bro Long, let us move
                                            inside to speak in private? Standing here for everyone to see isn’t the best
                                            way to solve any issues, and it is not how I greet my guests.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya nodded and said: “Very well, Old Monster Xue, I will give you that
                                            face.”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian waved his hand and said: “Come then.” As he said that, he headed
                                            for the castle entrance.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya’s gaze swept across to land upon the Lion King Gu Site and the
                                            Lion Prince Gu Yingbing. “You two come as well. The matter I have come to
                                            speak off concerns you both as well.” After saying that, he beckoned to Zhou
                                            Weiqing who was still behind him, still covered with the cowl of his cloak,
                                            but his hidden face was filled with shock and awe. He then followed behind
                                            Xue AoTian as he entered the castle, easily taking the second position.</p>
                                        <p>All that had just happened was just so quick, and naturally Zhou Weiqing had
                                            witnessed everything. With his intelligence, he could easily guess who all
                                            these people were as well.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since he had formally acknowledged Long Shiya as his Master, this was
                                            the first time that Zhou Weiqing had actually seen him take action.
                                            Previously, when Long Shiya had fought, Zhou Weiqing had clearly sensed that
                                            around his own body, there was an invisible shield protecting him, so that
                                            he would not be affected by any of the energy reverberations from the clash
                                            of the two powerhouses.</p>
                                        <p>This was also the first time he had witnessed the true terrifying power of
                                            the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation. As the only disciple and heir
                                            of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, Zhou Weiqing was naturally much
                                            clearer about the uses of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation and
                                            the intricacies of what Long Shiya had done, even compared to the Lion King
                                            Gu Site who had experienced it for himself. Indeed, what Gu Site had guessed
                                            was true… Long Shiya did not use his full strength at all, and his control
                                            was so impressive and fine to such an unbelievable degree. If Long Shiya had
                                            wanted, he could have totally destroyed the Lion King in a flow of
                                            continuous attacks.</p>
                                        <p>Invincible amongst the same stage. This was what Long Shiya rated his own Six
                                            Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation. This was not hubris at all; and
                                            regarding such a rating, even the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord had never
                                            refuted it; otherwise he would have never said that this formation was the
                                            greatest formation in the entire Boundless Mainland.</p>
                                        <p>Even though the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation had its own
                                            drawbacks and disadvantages, the sheer amount of advantages and superiority
                                            it had far surpassed those drawbacks. If one were to pick at it stringently,
                                            its worst flaw would be the unbelievable demanding amount of innate talent a
                                            user would need to have in order to even start learning it. After all, in
                                            the entire world, the number of people who could possibly have six
                                            Attributes was just too few… too few.</p>
                                        <p>That was the true power of THE Heavenly Emperor! Look at his Master! Just a
                                            single person alone, and he had actually intimated all the powerhouses from
                                            the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Even the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, while not
                                            intimated, treated him with much respect. The pride for his master swelled
                                            up in Zhou Weiqing’s heart.</p>
                                        <p>His feelings for Long Shiya was not just gratitude, but had grown to true
                                            familial love.</p>
                                        <p>The moment when Long Shiya had told him that he would personally bring him up
                                            to the Heavenly Snow Mountain, within Zhou Weiqing’s heart, Long Shiya’s
                                            status had risen up to almost the same level as his own father, not just a
                                            respected teacher.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>As they walked into the Heavenly Snow Castle, Zhou Weiqing focused his will
                                            inwards protectively, not paying much attention to his surroundings. That
                                            was because he could clearly sense that the Tiger King Xue Aoying who was
                                            following behind his teacher was silently observing him. As compared to the
                                            Lion King, Gu Site, who kept all his attention on Long Shiya, Xue Aoying was
                                            clearly much more interested in this unknown person following behind Long
                                            Shiya, face hidden.</p>
                                        <p>After all, everyone knew that the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was the
                                            ultimate lone wolf! No one had ever heard of him having any relatives, kin,
                                            descendents or even disciples. Yet, this time, ascending the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain, he had actually brought along this person. For the Tiger King,
                                            being so familiar with Long Shiya, how could he not have his interest
                                            sparked?</p>
                                        <p>With the Tiger King’s cultivation level of Heavenly Emperor, he could
                                            naturally sense that Zhou Weiqing was around the six-Jeweled stage. However,
                                            that was all his senses could detect on the surface. After all, Long Shiya
                                            was right there, and he could not just extend his Heavenly Energy to fully
                                            investigate. Furthermore, he could sense that around Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            presence, Long Shiya’s aura remained present protectively.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did his utmost best to keep his breathing steady. He knew that
                                            it would soon be his turn to be on the stage. Although the past few months
                                            he had spent fully preparing for this very moment, doing all he could to
                                            prepare for it, just standing right here in this strongest of the Great
                                            Saint Lands, his heart couldn’t help but race. However, no matter how
                                            nervous or afraid he was, the greatest feeling in his heart was still
                                            resolve. No matter for Tian’er’s sake, or for his Master’s reputation, he
                                            would no longer back down at all.</p>
                                        <p>With Xue AoTian in front personally leading the way, the group of them
                                            quickly reached the central Grand Hall, right in the middle of the Heavenly
                                            Snow Castle.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion King Gu Site had brought along his son Gu Yingbing; as for the two
                                            Heavenly King Stage powerhouses, they did not have the qualification to
                                            follow the group.</p>
                                        <p>In following the group, it was not that Gu Site was really that afraid of
                                            Long Shiya. As the Royal Emperor of the WanShou Empire, he would never have
                                            such an emotion. However, he did want to find out the reason why Long Shiya
                                            had come here so aggressively and righteously.</p>
                                        <p>As they entered the Grand Hall of the Heavenly Snow Castle, Xue AoTian took
                                            his seat at the head of the table, while the Lion King Gu Site naturally
                                            took the primary seat at his left. After all, in the entire WanShou Empire,
                                            his rank and status was second only to the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, Xue
                                            AoTian.</p>
                                        <p>However, strangely enough, something that might cause others to ponder was
                                            that the right hand primary seat was normally for the Tiger King to seat,
                                            yet he took the initiative to let Long Shiya have that seat, instead taking
                                            the one beside him. [1. In chinese culture (and hence these stories by
                                            extension, seating is extremely sensitive to position/rank/status]</p>
                                        <p>As for Gu Yingbing and zhou Weiqing, they naturally just stood behind the
                                            Lion King and Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor respectively. In such an
                                            occasion, how could they have any seat?</p>
                                        <p>The Lion King Gu Site glanced at the Tiger King Xue Aoying. Although he did
                                            not say anything, a flash of discontent crossed his eyes, and even Zhou
                                            Weiqing could clearly notice it.</p>
                                        <p>However, very quickly, his attention turned back to Long Shiya, his gaze
                                            filled with strong enmity and dissatisfaction with the previous fight
                                            result.</p>
                                        <p>Very quickly, servants came to bring tea to the table, the faint fragrance of
                                            the tea bringing some life to the icy cold hall. Xue AoTian gave an inviting
                                            gesture to Long Shiya, and he did not hesitate. The famous Icy Mist Tea of
                                            the Heavenly Snow Mountain was extremely delicious after all.</p>
                                        <p>As they drank their tea, Long Shiya totally ignored the glares from the Lion
                                            King, instead looking passively at Xue AoTian, as if in the short period of
                                            time his emotions had all calmed down.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion King might seem to have a short fuse and violent temper, but in
                                            truth he was not foolish or headstrong, his mind detailed indeed. Otherwise,
                                            how could he successfully arrange things to have his son end up as the main
                                            disciple of Xue AoTian and possible heir to the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>For Long Shiya to come to the Heavenly Snow Mountain to cause trouble at this
                                            critical period, especially with what he had said earlier… it was without
                                            question that it had something to do with his own Lion Tribe. The reason why
                                            he displayed such an intense enmity towards Long Shiya was also a way to
                                            show Xue AoTian his stance and resolve, to attempt to influence him.</p>
                                        <p>“For Bro Long to come here this time, I’m guessing it is not to join in the
                                            wedding festivities right?” Xue AoTian said with a faint smile. If one just
                                            looked at his outward appearance, no one would imagine that he was the top
                                            powerhouse in the entire world. Zhou Weiqing had been observing this
                                            possible father-in-law of his, and he was shocked to find that he could not
                                            even sense the slightest bit of Heavenly Energy reverberations around Xue
                                            AoTian. Yet, he had a strange aura about him that seemed as if he was
                                            naturally in control of everything around him.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said coldly: “Of course I’m not here to join any so-called
                                            wedding. Old Monster Xue, this time, I have come to get a reckoning from
                                            you.”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian arched a brow slightly. “Reckoning? What reckoning do I owe Bro
                                            Long, I do not recall anything?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya’s immense body slowly stood up. Immediately, a powerful and
                                            forceful presence emitted from him, but the target was not Xue AoTian, but
                                            the Lion Prince Gu Yingbing opposite him.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion King Gu Site immediately stood up, not daring to delay a second,
                                            circulating his Heavenly Energy to protect his son as he glared angrily at
                                            Long Shiya. “Fatty Long, you are now in the Heavenly Snow Castle, and you
                                            dare to behave so obnoxiously?” His words were simple but effective, aiming
                                            to sow discord and instigate something if possible.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian’s expression also clouded. “Bro Long, I have treated you as a
                                            guest here, and it is about to be my daughter’s wedding day… I do not wish
                                            to clash with you on such an occasion. Please state your business clearly.
                                            Yingbing is my son in law.”</p>
                                        <p>“Son in law?” All of a sudden, Long Shiya laughed out loud with no warning.
                                            “Well, it is hard to say who is your son in law right now. Old Monster Xue,
                                            you know my character very well. I, Long Shiya, all my life I have spent
                                            alone, chasing the pinnacle of cultivation and the theories of heavens, and
                                            I have no other living relatives. Have you ever seen me bring anyone along
                                            with me before?”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian started momentarily. He had never expected that Long Shiya would
                                            change the subject so quickly. Subconsciously, he said: “No…”</p>
                                        <p>“... Bro Long has always been alone, coming and going freely as you wish.
                                            Yet… this time…” At this moment, his interest was also piqued as he turned
                                            his attention to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, compared to his brother Xue Aoying, Xue AoTian’s senses were far
                                            superior. With just a single glance at Zhou Weiqing, a light of surprise
                                            flickered in his eyes. Although he could not fully determine what Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s Attributes were, he could immediately sense that his Elemental
                                            Jewels had six different Attributes.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said: “Not long ago, I finally accepted a disciple. This disciple
                                            of mine… he is like me, his Elemental Jewels having six Attributes. At long
                                            last, the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts that I have created can
                                            finally be passed down, and I have a heir of my own as well… I was so
                                            overjoyed, like I had found some precious treasure. I trust that Old Monster
                                            Xue, you can understand my feelings in this matter.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Long Shiya’s words, some understanding dawned upon Xue AoTian’s
                                            heart, but at the same time a sense of foreboding came over him. Towards
                                            Long Shiya, he was just too familiar. With that character of his, it was
                                            nearly impossible for him to find a disciple. Yet, now that he had truly
                                            found one, he could just imagine the sheer protectiveness. Furthermore, he
                                            could indistinctly guess who Long Shiya’s disciple was… and he knew that it
                                            would not be an easy matter to settle.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said coldly: “This old man has already lived for more than a
                                            hundred years, and finally I have a relative.. a descendent. Yet… he was
                                            almost killed by this disciple of yours. Although he barely managed to
                                            survive, but his four limbs were all broken. Old Monster Xue, if do not give
                                            me a good reckoning that satisfies me, then this old man will declare war on
                                            your Heavenly Snow Mountain and even the WanShou Empire. For the rest of my
                                            life, I will make sure that you all will know no peace.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
