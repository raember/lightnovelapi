                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er gave a humph and said: “Is that really a punishment? More
                                            like a gift.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er giggled, saying: “Big sis, don’t just say me. What stage
                                            have you and that naughty fellow advanced to? If I did not guess wrongly, he
                                            must have taken advantage of you somehow. Otherwise, with your character,
                                            how could you easily fall for a man?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er blushed faintly, glaring slightly at her sister before
                                            saying: “If you keep talking about this, I’ll disqualify you from
                                            participating in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Furthermore, if you want to
                                            marry him, just go ahead and marry him, what connection is there with
                                            me?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er continued smiling, saying teasingly: “Is that true? Hmmmm…
                                            but… I don’t know who it was who heard Papa speak about how Zhou Weiqing
                                            told him about the Saint Energy, using the fact that he can help us
                                            consolidate Saint Core Nucleus in exchange for Papa’s agreement to our
                                            matter… who was it who was so touched? Sis, I have never you seen you so
                                            touched by another man. Us sisters have such strong empathy with each other,
                                            it is no point acting.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er gave a humph, but she did not refute Shangguan Fei’er’s
                                            words. “That is because you do not know what the Saint Energy truly means. I
                                            never expected he would do such a thing. That Saint Energy that he and
                                            Tian’er cultivated, as long as he is given sufficient time, he will become
                                            the most powerful in the entire… not one of.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er’s eyes opened wide in shock. “Even that one on the Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain also can’t?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded seriously.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, Shangguan Bing’er suddenly lifted up her head where she
                                            had been crying in Shangguan Xue’er’s embrace. With eyes still blurred from
                                            tears, she said: “Big sis, Second Sis, I miss Little Fatty, I really miss
                                            him…”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er gently patted her sister’s back, saying softly: “Bing’er,
                                            don’t be so anxious, you will get to see him very soon.”</p>
                                        <p>“You have just finished your closed door cultivation, and you need to
                                            recuperate your body in this period; you need to refrain from overwhelming
                                            yourself with emotions. He won’t run away, don’t worry. He is no longer the
                                            same Zhou Weiqing as he was years ago. Currently, even if a Heavenly King
                                            Stage powerhouse tries something against him, it won’t be so easy to
                                            succeed.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing returned to the inn, telling Yun Li and the others that he would
                                            be entering a short closed door cultivation with Tian’er before heading back
                                            to his room.</p>
                                        <p>He told Tian’er about everything that had happened in the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Island, not hiding anything at all. This was where Zhou Weiqing showed his
                                            intelligence. He knew he had been a playboy, and if had to keep trying to
                                            hide or balance the relationships between the girls, he would never have
                                            time for anything else. As such, Zhou Weiqing had long decided that he would
                                            treat all his wives equally, speaking the truth about matters. Although
                                            sometimes the truth wasn’t comfortable to listen to, at least once you told
                                            the truth, you didn’t have to worry about covering up lies and
                                            stumbling.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er listened to Zhou Weiqing’s telling, and she just remained quietly in
                                            his embrace, holding his hand but remaining quiet.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing asked tentatively, a little nervous: “Dear, aren’t you jealous?”
                                            As soon as he asked that, he wanted to slap himself. Who would ask such a
                                            question? Alas, the words were already out of his mouth, and he couldn’t
                                            take it back.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er gave a light humph. “What is the point of being jealous? If I really
                                            was jealous, would you abandon them? I have already thought things through,
                                            if you really don’t want me in the future, I will take the child and live by
                                            myself. Anyway I already have a precious baby, you aren’t so important
                                            anymore.”</p>
                                        <p>“Ehhh… Why does it sound like I’m just a studhorse…” Zhou Weiqing gave a
                                            depressed look as he said.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er giggled and said: “You are exactly just a stud horse[1. He is making
                                            a pun here. 种马 literally means stud horse, but is also ‘net’ slang for harem
                                            stories].”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Dearest, since you want a child, then we
                                            should make the best use of our time. After all, we don’t really know if we
                                            truly have a child together yet right? Heh heh.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er gave him a light punch, saying: “Didn’t you say we were going to
                                            cultivate in closed door cultivation, to do some last minute training?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her beautiful face and smooth skin, and his hands
                                            couldn’t help themselves as they ‘roamed’ about. “Well… it won’t take that
                                            long… it’s just to get us in the mood for cultivating.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er: “.......”</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Days passed, one after the other, and as it got closer and closer to the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament, the ZhongTian City also grew more crowded,
                                            bustling with life. Although the ordinary citizens did not know the unique
                                            underlying currents in this year’s Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and they did
                                            not know about the changes in the Lustre Spatial Realm of the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace which caused it; to them, it was still one of the grandest
                                            events they could experience every time it was organized.</p>
                                        <p>All the rooms in the inns were already filled up, and some of the Battle
                                            Teams which had come later had to go to the ZhongTian Empire to arrange
                                            places for them to stay.</p>
                                        <p>The lively atmosphere infected almost everyone in the entire ZhongTian City,
                                            and various news about the Heavenly Jewel Tournament also spread like
                                            wildfire. This was especially so for all the estimations of each Battle
                                            Team’s strength; there were so many various editions spreading around.</p>
                                        <p>After all, the Heavenly Jewel Tournament was also one of the ZhongTian Empire
                                            top betting events. After all, there were so many people joining the
                                            Tournament, and if one could seize the opportunity to bet on a dark horse,
                                            they could possibly gain a fortune overnight. For example, the last
                                            Tournament’s Fei Li Empire… Although many had lost a lot of gold, there were
                                            the few who had made off like kings with the sheer odds… especially during
                                            the fight against the Dan Dun Empire where it had been a 100 to 1 odds… Zhou
                                            Weiqing was not the only one who had earned from that.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst the over twenty Battle Teams that had joined, the most attention was
                                            naturally focused on the powerful Battle Teams which had the Great Saint
                                            Lands behind their backs. This was a normal situation that happened every
                                            single Heavenly Jewel Tournament. However, this year, another team was also
                                            under high scrutiny, and that was naturally the Fei Li Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>After all, the Fei Li Battle Team had been the biggest dark horse in the
                                            previous Heavenly Jewel Tournament, perhaps even in the history of the
                                            Tournament itself. More so, it had actually won all the way, even obtaining
                                            the final championship, shocking the entire world. This round, naturally
                                            there were many who looked at them with high hopes and expectations. Of
                                            course, every single Battle Team was doing their best to keep their team
                                            members and strength secret. As such, the news that ordinary citizens could
                                            get was highly limited, and amongst them, the Fei Li Battle Team was one of
                                            the most mysterious ones… and also one that had greatest anticipation for
                                            many.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Heavenly Bow Battle Team, no one would pay attention to them.
                                            Every session of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, there would be countless of
                                            small empires joining the Tournament, but all of them just served as a foil
                                            or contrast to the large empires.</p>
                                        <p>Only a few observant people would notice that this Heavenly Bow Empire which
                                            had already been destroyed, had actually appeared on the main namelist of
                                            the Heavenly Jewel Tournament… what did that mean? Of course, even if they
                                            noticed it, they did not pay much attention to it. Who would treat such an
                                            unknown Battle Team as one of the hot favourites?</p>
                                        <p>By this time, the registration period of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament had
                                            ended. This year, there were a total of twenty five Battle Teams,
                                            representing their respective Empires. Similarly to past years, they were
                                            split into four groups, three with six teams each and a fourth with seven
                                            Battle Teams. For that particular group, it would perhaps be relatively
                                            harder to advance.</p>
                                        <p>The lot-drawing ceremony has also completed yesterday, and the one to
                                            represent the Heavenly Bow Empire to draw lots was Yun Li. However, when he
                                            returned with the results of the lots and told Zhou Weiqing, it gave Zhou
                                            Weiqing such a huge shock that he could only stare with jaw agape.</p>
                                        <p>The group which the Heavenly Bow Empire had been placed into could truly be
                                            called the ‘Group of Death’. Not only was it the only group with seven
                                            Battle Teams, the real reason it was called the Group of Death was because
                                            there were actually TWO of the Battle Teams backed by the Great Saint Lands!
                                            Perhaps what made Zhou Weiqing speechless was that several of them were even
                                            old enemies and foes, or those with links to them.</p>
                                        <p>This group had seven teams which included the ZhongTian Battle Team, Dan Dun
                                            Battle Team, Bai Da Battle Team, Kalise Battle Team, Mi Ou Battle Team,
                                            Geritimo Battle Team and of course, the Heavenly Bow Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>“Big bro… are you toying with me? Please say you are.” Zhou Weiqing looked at
                                            Yun Li’s calm face, then back down at the group list and schedule, his brow
                                            twitching violently.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li glanced at him, but did not speak.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had a ‘speechless’ look on his face, as he said: “My dear big
                                            boss, this is not true right?! Are you trying to play me to my death?! What
                                            kind of enemies did you draw!! All old friends and old foes! If you want me
                                            to die, you should just say so directly. This must be a prank right? Quick,
                                            take out the real schedule.”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li said exasperatedly: “This is the real result. If you don’t believe it,
                                            you can go look for yourself. Isn’t it just a bit of bad luck, it’s not like
                                            I did it on purpose. Anyway, this is also a good thing right? Any enmity, we
                                            can deal with it all at once.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s heart was bleeding! “Big brother… is this really just a ‘bit’
                                            of bad luck?! Look at all the enemies? ZhongTian Empire… nothing much more
                                            needs to be said right? With the three Shangguan Sisters… we don’t have to
                                            imagine that they will go easy on us. Don’t forget your precious Little Miss
                                            Muddle will be part of them… I dare say their average cultivation level is
                                            at least seven Jewels or higher.”</p>
                                        <p>“Next is the Dan Dun Empire… that is an old enemy of mine. I heard that the
                                            previous team leader Shen Little Demon has already reached the seven-Jeweled
                                            stage, yet this time she couldn’t even make it as the Vice Leader. So… yeah,
                                            they can’t be underestimated either. Besides that, well… at least the Kalise
                                            Empire and Bai Da Empire are great, those are the two that I had hoped to
                                            meet the most. At least I can vent my anger then…”</p>
                                        <p>“Then, there is the Geritimo Empire… This is also a large Empire equal to the
                                            Fei Li Empire, and they have just lost a war against the Dan Dun Empire…
                                            they will definitely be gearing up their best to take revenge in this
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament… so it will be safe to say that their Battle Team
                                            will also not be weak.”</p>
                                        <p>“Overall… besides the Mi Ou Battle Team which should be an easy fight… we
                                            will have three extremely tough fights ahead of us just in the group stages
                                            alone. And there will only be two Battle Teams which can advance from ths
                                            group stages. I… I…”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li said helplessly: “The lots have been drawn, it is already set in
                                            stone… what else can I do?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said savagely: “What else can you do… hmph… every round you will
                                            be the first to fight. Let’s see what else you can do. Hmph Hmph.”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li was also staunch and unyielding. With a humph of his own, he retorted:
                                            “Fine, I’m fine with being first to fight!”</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>At last, the official start date of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament was finally
                                            here. Before dawn, the entire ZhongTian City was already bustling with life
                                            and cheer. The sounds of sales, shouting, breakfast, all of it rose and fall
                                            from every single corner of the city.</p>
                                        <p>After having breakfast, the ZhongTian Battle Team members were all called to
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s room.</p>
                                        <p><img alt="Straw/Bamboo Hat" class="alignleft size-medium" height="183"

                                                width="275"/>“Wear these clothes, and these bamboo hats. We will set off
                                            soon.” Zhou Weiqing pointed to the pile of clothes on the table. Both he and
                                            Tian’er had already changed into them.</p>
                                        <p>These were unbelievably simple clothings. Grey, plain common clothes. Indeed,
                                            simple cotton clothing which weren’t even military attire. The only
                                            redeeming feature about the clothes was that they were of pure cotton, so
                                            they were at least relatively comfortable. There was pretty much no
                                            difference between these clothes and that of ordinary work attire of porters
                                            and haulers… without any decorations or embellishments.</p>
                                        <p>Besides the grey clothes, there was a simple bamboo hat, with a simple
                                            tassel. In any case, once they wore that hat, as long as it wasn’t someone
                                            with x-ray vision, no one could tell how they looked like.</p>
