                                        <p>Additionally, after entering the space, the Sidhe Queen could only feel a
                                            soft yet supreme and dignified aura engulfing her body. That energy was more
                                            superior than her Nature Energy. Both Zhou Weiqing and her were surrounded
                                            by reddish golden light - without a doubt, Zhou Weiqing was using his Saint
                                            Energy to protect the both of them as they were in the midst of Spatial
                                            Shuttle.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grasped Spatial Shuttle via his Blink Skill - one of the most
                                            important takeaways was locking onto the target, which was what he did when
                                            he was using the Blink Skill to travel through space collectively with the
                                            women. As long as the target’s location was in his field of vision, he would
                                            be successful. This was the power and might of Saint Energy. Of course, his
                                            high cultivation base was also one of the factors for his success. </p>
                                        <p>However, it was different right now. It was also Zhou Weiqing’s first time
                                            traveling through space like that - he used the trace of his will that he
                                            left on the princess as his locked target. If he succeeded, not only could
                                            they directly shuttle out of the sidhe’s sealed grounds and return back to
                                            the Boundless Mainland, they could also directly appear right in front of
                                            the Sidhe Princess. This was clearly the most efficient way. </p>
                                        <p>Additionally, Zhou Weiqing was not afraid that the trace of his will on the
                                            princess would disappear. Reason being that he had full confidence in his
                                            will, and also, he had already locked their previous location as well. Thus,
                                            even if they lost the coordinates of the Sidhe Princess, he would still be
                                            able to bring the Sidhe Queen back to where they came from. Hence, he was
                                            full of confidence. </p>
                                        <p>Traveling through space felt extremely bizarre. Zhou Weiqing could clearly
                                            sense his Saint Energy getting exhausted rapidly. The speed at which the
                                            consumption was going at was a lot faster than if he were to fly. He felt
                                            that the consumption of his Saint Energy was the greatest when he used
                                            Spatial Shuttle to travel from the sealed grounds back to Boundless Mainland
                                            - a tenth of his Saint Energy was exhausted almost immediately. </p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was unaware that the Sidhe Queen was very
                                            shocked. The Sidhe Queen did not have Spatial Attribute within her body,
                                            hence she was not able to carry out Spatial Shuttle. However, that did not
                                            mean that she had no knowledge of it. </p>
                                        <p>The Sidhe Queen had lived for nearly a thousand years, she was definitely
                                            very knowledgeable and experienced. Even though she could not perform
                                            Spatial Shuttle, she knew powerhouses with that ability. However, based on
                                            what she knew, even Heavenly God Stage powerhouses would not be able to
                                            carry out Spatial Shuttle for more than five seconds. Or else, their energy
                                            would be entirely exhausted to the point where they would get lost within
                                            space and would be stuck there forever, despite being powerful Heavenly God
                                            Stage powerhouses. </p>
                                        <p>In Zhou Weiqing’s case, even though she did not make detailed calculations,
                                            she was positive that it had been more than five seconds since he started
                                            performing Spatial Shuttle. </p>
                                        <p><em>So this is the wonder of Saint Energy. </em>The Sidhe Queen couldn’t help
                                            but exclaim to herself. </p>
                                        <p>In fact, the purity of Saint Energy allowed Zhou Weiqing’s consumption of his
                                            energy to be much lower compared to ordinary Heavenly Jewel Masters.
                                            Furthermore, under any circumstances, the Saint Energy would voluntarily
                                            absorb all kinds of Attributes in the surroundings to replenish his body.
                                            During the process of traveling through the other dimension, it naturally
                                            absorbed Spatial Energy, which in turn helped Zhou Weiqing consume less
                                            energy. Otherwise, Zhou Weiqing would have long been unable to withstand the
                                            massive consumption.</p>
                                        <p>However, even so, after a short period of Spatial Shuttle, Zhou Weiqing still
                                            had to release his Dragon-Tiger wings. With the wings spread wide open, it
                                            allowed him to better absorb the Spatial Energy, which helped him last a bit
                                            longer in the other dimension.</p>
                                        <p>Even though the Sidhe Princess was taken away not too long ago, the other
                                            party had already brought her somewhere far away from the sidhe’s sealed
                                            grounds. Of course, it was possible for Zhou Weiqing to break out of the
                                            space to take a rest before starting the second round of Spatial Shuttle,
                                            except that it would be very embarrassing! His intention was to display his
                                            power and strength in front of the Sidhe Queen. If he wanted to form an
                                            alliance with the sidhe, he had to show her how strong and powerful he was.
                                            However, he had absolutely no idea that his performance had already exceeded
                                            the Sidhe Queen’s expectations that were formed based on his cultivation
                                            base. She had already considered him to be a lot stronger than her - she
                                            overestimated him!</p>
                                        <p>“Found it,” Zhou Weiqing exclaimed softly in excitement. Just as the Sidhe
                                            Queen was taken aback by that fella’s ability to speak while traveling
                                            through space, a light flashed - the both of them had broken out of the
                                            other dimension and were back in the normal world. </p>
                                        <p>In the air, a crevice appeared without any prior indication. Immediately
                                            after, the two figures emerged. They happened to be in the way of a man in
                                            black flying speedily in the sky.  </p>
                                        <p>The man in black was flying relatively fast, but his senses were very keen -
                                            he immediately sensed something amiss. The crevice appeared right in front
                                            of him abruptly before the two figures appeared out of nowhere, catching him
                                            off guard. Instinctively, he dodged, in a bid to get out of their way and
                                            resume his flight. Unfortunately, he was their target. </p>
                                        <p>“Trying to escape?” Zhou Weiqing hated that fella to the core - he was made a
                                            scapegoat by that bastard and almost went to war with the sidhe as a result.
                                            Dark golden wave-like light lit up on his body; he had equipped himself with
                                            the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set. His figure flashed, executing the Spatial
                                            Shuttle once again. As his body re-appeared, the Dual Legendary Hammers
                                            struck at the same time. Zhou Weiqing had used all his strength in that
                                            attack. </p>
                                        <p>The man in black was no ordinary person either. His facial expression changed
                                            in the face of Zhou Weiqing’s attack. He raised both hands up at the same
                                            time and gestured. A layer of strange distorted invisible halo appeared,
                                            blocking Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Legendary Hammers.</p>
                                        <p>It was Time Attribute - Zhou Weiqing had already known that the fella
                                            possessed Time Attribute abilities. The moment he saw the opponent use a
                                            technique similar to Time Rift to block his hammers, he couldn’t help but
                                            smile grimly. </p>
                                        <p>Indeed, Time Attribute was one of the four Saint Attributes. With such power
                                            and might, generally speaking, physical attacks could not be pitted against
                                            Time Rift. They would definitely fail without a doubt. However, Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s  Dual Legendary Hammers were not that easy to be dealt with.</p>
                                        <p>After the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set was fully assembled, Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            Legendary Set had boosted some of his abilities. For example, it eliminated
                                            all energy present. That was to say that the supplementary power of the
                                            ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set could go against any Energy Attributes with
                                            sheer brute force, and it also rendered the opponent’s energy-related skills
                                            to be ineffective.</p>
                                        <p>Amidst the loud sounds, the black figure grunted. It was as though he was
                                            being bombarded by cannonballs – even the sound of his arms breaking into
                                            pieces could be heard clearly. </p>
                                        <p>The supplementary power of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set was indeed
                                            terrifying - even Heavenly God Stage powerhouses would definitely be
                                            unwilling to face Zhou Weiqing head-on. It was the Legendary Set’s first
                                            appearance in a battle; no one had seen it before. The bright golden armor
                                            was not only dazzling and aesthetically pleasing, it was also ranked first
                                            or second amongst all the other Legendary Sets, in terms of power.</p>
                                        <p>The man in black was astonished. His body twisted continuously in the sky,
                                            when suddenly, he retreated a kilometer away. His broken arms had returned
                                            to their normal state.</p>
                                        <p>“Eh, Time Reversal?” said Zhou Weiqing in shock. Indeed, his opponent had
                                            just executed Time Reversal. From the looks of it, the opponent had mastered
                                            Time Reversal - he could proficiently control time, allowing himself to
                                            return to a few seconds before. Not only did he dodge Zhou Weiqing’s attack,
                                            both his arms had also recovered. </p>
                                        <p>As someone with the Saint Attribute, he knew that a person with the Time
                                            Attribute would definitely possess a few unique skills like himself. </p>
                                        <p>Unfortunately, his opponent was Zhou Weiqing, who also possessed Time
                                            Attribute. Hence, he knew exactly how to deal with Time Reversal. His
                                            opponent was able to effectively use Time Reversal once, but if he were to
                                            continue using it, it would lose its efficacy. </p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing was about to launch an attack, the Sidhe Queen on the other
                                            side had already taken action; the two of them appeared in the air. Standing
                                            before the man in black, the Sidhe Queen knew for a fact that he was the one
                                            who kidnapped her daughter. After Zhou Weiqing had launched his first
                                            attack, in the next moment, a layer of light in a soothing shade of green
                                            was released from the Sidhe Queen’s body.</p>
                                        <p>The green light did not target the enemy directly - it dispersed in all
                                            directions. In an instant, the surroundings had completely become a shade of
                                            green, giving off exuberant vitality vibes.</p>
                                        <p>However, it provided the man in black with a pleasant feeling as such.
                                            Indeed, it was full of vitality, but apart from the six Nature Elemental
                                            Attributes, all the other Attributes were dispelled, including Time.
                                            Additionally, the Nature Attributes within the green space could only be
                                            controlled by the Sidhe Queen alone. There was no way of enhancing any of
                                            his abilities.</p>
                                        <p>This was the Sidhe Queen’s Nature Celestial Territory. The difference between
                                            a Heavenly God and a Heavenly Emperor was that the former was able to
                                            solidify the effects of the external surroundings. The special ability that
                                            came from this solidification was called ‘Celestial Territory’. Every
                                            Heavenly God Stage powerhouse had their own exclusive Celestial
                                            Territory.</p>
                                        <p>Within the Sidhe Queen’s Celestial Territory, in order to put up a fight
                                            against her, you must either also possess a Celestial Territory or use sheer
                                            brute force. Otherwise, there was no chance of winning, unless you could
                                            defeat the Sidhe Queen herself within her Celestial Territory. </p>
                                        <p>Previously, when the Sidhe Queen was fighting against Zhou Weiqing, the Demon
                                            God’s overwhelming menacing aura was so powerful that it vaguely created
                                            something similar to a Celestial Territory. Hence, the Sidhe Queen did not
                                            release her own Celestial Territory, as she knew that it would have been
                                            ineffective. However, at this moment, it was effective against the man in
                                            black. This was because both Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen had clearly
                                            seen that the man in black only had eleven Personal Jewels. He was only a
                                            Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse.</p>
