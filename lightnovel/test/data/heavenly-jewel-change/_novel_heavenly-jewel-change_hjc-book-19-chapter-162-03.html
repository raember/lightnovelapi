                                            any of my Peerless Battalion military actions. At the same time, I will
                                            first advance each of you five million gold coins. If the thirty percent
                                            casualties actually happen, both of you can leave at any time, even keeping
                                            all the provided equipment.”</p>
                                        <p>Thirty percent of a thousand men, that was three hundred men. Although the
                                            Gold Crow and Berserker Tribes barely numbered more than ten thousand
                                            tribesmen in total combined, a loss of that number was still barely
                                            acceptable for them. This was a chance that they had to choose whether to
                                            bet on or not.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Long and Hong Yu exchanged looks, as if somehow communicating silently,
                                            then they both turned back to look at Zhou Weiqing once more.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s gaze was honest and sincere, and facing their gazes, he just
                                            smiled faintly in good faith.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Long couldn’t help but ask: “Battalion Commander Zhou, are you that sure
                                            that in all the future fights, our losses will not cross thirty percent?
                                            After all, that is extremely difficult to guarantee in a battlefield. In the
                                            end, if you want to restore your homeland, you will need to fight many
                                            battles, and it will be a long process indeed.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Vice Commander Wei.”</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng took a step forward and said respectfully: “Yes, Sir?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Please inform the two Tribe Leaders about our Peerless
                                            Battalion’s military exploits and accomplishments since we have formed.”</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng nodded in agreement and turned to face Ma Long and Hong Yu, saying
                                            solemnly: “Two Tribe Leaders, Greetings. Our Peerless Battalion has been
                                            formed for about nine months or so. In this period of time, we have fought a
                                            few times with the WanShou Empire. In our first fight, we faced a Company of
                                            enemy forces, managing to kill them all. Our losses, zero. Next, we met with
                                            the WanShou Empire Swift Wolf Regiment, ten thousand cavalry soldiers
                                            attacking us. At that time, our Peerless Battalion numbered one thousand
                                            five hundred. We killed over four thousand of them, and our losses were
                                            zero. Yesterday’s fight, we numbered five hundred of our elite, killing over
                                            three thousand enemies, and once again, zero losses.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Wei Feng’s short and succinct summary, both Hong Yu and Ma Long’s
                                            faces showed surprise. In Wei Feng’s report, there was one thing that was
                                            constant - the zero losses of the Peerless Battalion fighters. That was to
                                            say, every single fight of theirs up until now had been a total and complete
                                            victory.</p>
                                        <p>Perhaps, if they had not experienced the fight yesterday, having been saved
                                            by the First Main Company of the Peerless Battalion, it would have been
                                            extremely difficult or even impossible for the two Tribe Leaders to believe
                                            Wei Feng’s words. However, having seen the power of the Peerless Battalion
                                            with their own eyes, they naturally did not suspect anything. After all, no
                                            matter what, when the Peerless Battalion had come to rescue them yesterday,
                                            they had definitely been facing two powerful Regiments of enemy soldiers,
                                            and they had experienced the fighting capabilities of the two for
                                            themselves. In that fight, the Peerless Battalion First Main Company’s main
                                            enemy had even been the stronger of the two, the Unicorn Cavalry
                                            Regiment!</p>
                                        <p>After Wei Feng finished his report, he returned to his seat silently.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued: “Two Tribe Leaders, since our Peerless Battalion was
                                            set up, up until now in all our fights on the battlefield, not a single one
                                            of our brothers have died. Naturally, injuries are unavoidable, but I have
                                            told every single Peerless Battalion soldiers that each and every one of
                                            their lives are of utmost importance. In the future, they will all be heroes
                                            on the battlefield. My aspiration is not just for us to beat our enemies,
                                            but to destroy them without taking any losses. Our numbers are not high, but
                                            just think about this…  no matter how powerful the Bai Da Empire is, can
                                            they even be compared to the WanShou Empire armies, in terms of either
                                            numbers, army strength or personal power? Furthermore, the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire is my homeland, and the Bai Da Empire is the invader from outsider… I
                                            believe strongly that when we attack and make a public appeal, we will get
                                            much support from the public.”</p>
                                        <p>“Towards your Berserker and Gold Crow tribes, I have already formulated some
                                            plans a while back, just awaiting your arrival. I believe that you have
                                            already seen for yourselves the equipment of our Peerless Battalion, all of
                                            them wearing light mail crafted from titanium alloy.”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Long and Hong Yu nodded their heads subconsciously. It could be said that
                                            after they had seen the equipment, they had both been salivating after them.
                                            For the entire Peerless Battalion to be equipped with the titanium light
                                            mail, how much money did that cost! With such fine weapons and armour to
                                            protect them, naturally the soldiers would have a much greater chance of
                                            survival on the battlefield.</p>
                                        <p>Hong yu was the first to lose her composure, quickly saying: “Battalion
                                            Commander Zhou, are you saying that you will be willing to equip our two
                                            Tribes’ warriors with the same titanium light mail?”</p>
                                        <p>Under the heated gazes of the two Tribe Leaders, Zhou Weiqing actually shook
                                            his head slowly.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Long’s brow furrowed, but he did not speak. After all, they had just
                                            reached, and they had not made any contributions to the Peerless Battalion
                                            yet, and they could not ask for too much for now. Of course, logic was
                                            logic, but they couldn’t help feeling disappointed.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “How could the defensive capabilities
                                            of the titanium light mail be sufficient.”</p>
                                        <p>“En?” Both Ma Long and Hong Yu were caught by surprised, their faces
                                            revealing their curiosity, as they did not understand what Zhou Weiqing
                                            meant.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued: “Our entire Peerless Battalion currently numbers
                                            about five thousand soldiers, and under our special technique arts, they are
                                            now all Jewel Masters, with the great majority being Physical Jewel Masters.
                                            Regarding our Peerless Battalion finances, both Tribe Leaders do not need to
                                            worry; our Physical Jewel Masters are all targeting to be fully becoming the
                                            Peerless Air Force that both of you have witnessed in action yesterday.
                                            Equipped with Consolidated Wings, their fighting also has to be done high up
                                            in the blue skies. Under such a circumstance, if their equipment weighs too
                                            much, it will greatly influence their flying speed and more importantly,
                                            sustainability and time of flight. As such, the equipment I chose for them
                                            is just the titanium alloy light mail.”</p>
                                        <p>Titanium Light Mail… ‘Just’? Both Ma Long and Hong Yu couldn’t help but feel
                                            their hearts convulse at such phrasings.</p>
                                        <p>By that point, Hong Yu was not able to resist, and she piped out: “What about
                                            our warriors then? Battalion Commander Zhou, please don’t keep us guessing,
                                            what is your exact plan?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “The equipment that I have envisioned for both
                                            your Tribes’ warriors is to make them into moving steel fortresses. Not only
                                            will they be armed to the death, I want them to be so armoured that even if
                                            they stand there and allow low level Jewel Masters to strike at them at
                                            will, their defense cannot be broken through. My goal is to make every one
                                            of your warriors to become an unstoppable killing machine on the
                                            battlefield, to cause all our enemies to fear even the sound of your names.
                                            From Ma Qun and Crow, I have seen the immense possibility of the Berserker
                                            and Gold Crow Tribes, and the possibilities are endless. You all do not lack
                                            power, but currently what you lack is unity, formation, training and the
                                            finest equipment. As for the exact details, it is too soon for me to speak
                                            of right now, and I am sure that both Tribe Leaders will soon be able to see
                                            with your own eyes. What I can tell you in advance is that the equipment for
                                            each Berserker or Gold Crow Tribe soldier will cost at least five times that
                                            of a Peerless Battalion Air Force soldier.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s bold guarantee, both Ma Long and Hong Yu were stunned
                                            into silence. Equipment that cost five times that of titanium alloy light
                                            mail? What could that possibly be? They could not even envision such a
                                            thing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued: “Originally, my plan was to mould the Berserker and
                                            Gold Crow Tribe Warriors into our Peerless Battalion Heavy Armour Infantry.
                                            However, after seeing the Berserker Tribe’s talent in taming and training
                                            horses, I might make a few slight changes to that plan. I hope that in the
                                            near future, both your Tribes can become a unique force in your own right…
                                            Atop horses, you are Heavy Cavalry Soldiers, and upon dismounting, you are
                                            Heavy Armour Infantry soldiers. In this way, my plan for you being an
                                            unstoppable storm of metal along the battlefield can be perfect.”</p>
                                        <p>That’s it. Your Father, I, will go along with the Peerless Battalion!” At
                                            that point, Ma Qun had been incited by Zhou Weiqing’s words, and this
                                            valiant but rough man waved his hand and decided the fate of his Berserker
                                            Tribe in one instant. If they were afraid to take the risk and fight for
                                            their survival, they would have stayed in the Fei Li Empire. Now they had
                                            already taken the first step forward, if they did not go ahead, perhaps the
                                            Berserker Tribe would never have the opportunity the hold their heads up
                                            high ever again. In the past, the Fei Li Empire had once bribed their Tribes
                                            to fight… but in the end? They were always used as cannon fodders, and the
                                            continued wars had caused so many casualties to their Tribesmen. As a
                                            result, over time, both Tribes had started declining, reaching their lowest
                                            point. Yet, today, Zhou Weiqing had not spoken about how the two Tribes can
                                            fight for him, but first detailing out how he could ensure the survival of
                                            all his warriors, how to equip them properly. Just this factor alone had met
                                            with both Hong Yu and Ma Long’s approval.”</p>
                                        <p>“Very well, I am also in. However, our Gold Crow Tribe has a unique request.”
                                            Hong Yu said.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Please, do tell.”</p>
                                        <p>Hong Yu continued: “Battalion Commander Zhou, I see that you have many stout
                                            little fellows in your Peerless Battalion. Look, our Tribe has so many
                                            beautiful ladies, don’t you think it would be perfect to match some of
                                            them?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Tribe Leader Hong Yu, this issue, Crow has already spoken
                                            to me about it previously. However, I do have a question first… since the
                                            Berserker and Gold Crow Tribes are have been friends for generations, why do
                                            you not marry within the Tribes?”</p>
                                        <p>Hong Yu glanced towards Ma Long with an exasperated, almost indignant look,
                                            before turning back to Zhou Weiqing and saying: “Well, it is not that we do
                                            not want to marry within our tribes. In fact, we do so indeed. However, the
                                            problem is that after so many years, so many generations, both our Tribes
                                            have really inter-married so many times, so much so that many of us are
                                            related in some way or the other. If we continue doing so, it will soon
                                            become endogamy, and possibly causing children with born defects…. As such,,
                                            unless we can confirm that both sides do not have too close a relation, for
                                            example like Ma Qun and Crow, our Tribesmen usually will not choose to
                                            intermarry.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing finally understood this little problem that had been nagging at
                                            him all this time, and he said: “Very well, this should be no problem at
                                            all, and I will agree to it. Naturally, our Peerless Battalion will be happy
                                            to help bring about this mutually beneficial agreement.” Although the Gold
                                            Crow Tribe women were taller and larger than normal, but do not forget that
                                            these Peerless Battalion soldiers were mostly ruffians from Ruffian
                                            Battalions, and they had not had intimate contact with women for years. This
                                            should not be a big problem. Furthermore, if the Peerless Battalion warriors
                                            do actually get engaged or marry with the Gold Crow Tribe, that would
                                            undoubtedly bind the two sides together… Such a good thing, how could Zhou
                                            Weiqing be against it?</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>With this, the matter about settling the two powerful Tribes had finally come
                                            to a close. Next, Zhou Weiqing began issuing a list of commands.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo would still be in charge of the logistics and supplies, mainly
                                            regarding the equipment of the entire Battalion and coordinating with the
                                            two Consolidating Equipment Masters. Although the Gold Crow and Berserker
                                            Tribes had just arrived, in truth the plan for their equipment had long been
                                            in effect, and some starting orders had already been placed previously. Of
                                            course, the Peerless Battalion soldiers also had room for improvement in
                                            terms of equipment too. In this aspect, their investment was unbelievably
                                            huge, and even the original hundred million gold that Zhou Weiqing had given
                                            them earlier had already been totally spent. Of course, the Heavenly Cores
                                            that Long Shiya had given him were just too numerous and valuable, and just
                                            selling them alone would able to finance the massive spending of the
                                            Peerless Battalion for more than ten more years.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing informed the others about him leaving for a period of time to
                                            enter closed door cultivation, asking Hua Feng to take over as a temporary
                                            Battalion Commander and leader of the Peerless Battalion, and that all
                                            decisions were to be made between him, Wei Feng and Shangguan Fei’er.</p>
                                        <p>The main war against the WanShou Empire was about to begin, and the main goal
                                            that Zhou Weiqing had for the Peerless Battalion going forward was to get as
                                            much combat experience as possible while ensuring zero losses. At the same
                                            time, he asked Lin TianAo to arrange to gather a large sum of gold, to be
                                            used as rewards for the soldiers for their merits in combat. As for
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, it would still take some time to complete.
                                            After all, several thousand Consolidating Equipment Scrolls of the Dual
                                            Wings needed a lot of time to complete, and would be a long, steady
                                            process.</p>
                                        <p>What followed next was a matter of training the soldiers before the actual
                                            fighting. For the training of the two new powerful infantry troops, Zhou
                                            Weiqing left it to Shangguan Fei’er. As for fighting formations, operational
                                            efficiency and other military capabilities, Zhou Weiqing decided to send for
                                            Zang Lang to join them. With him aiding Shangguan Fei’er, they would be able
                                            to train and greatly improve this new Infantry force that would definitely
                                            be an important addition to the Peerless Battalion forces.</p>
