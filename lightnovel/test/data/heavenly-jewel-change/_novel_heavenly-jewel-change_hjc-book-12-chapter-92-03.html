                                            Heavenly Beasts with the Time Attribute within this ‘Others’ exit?”</p>
                                        <p>The employee had clearly noticed the group of them earlier, and naturally
                                            knew they were from the Fei Li Battle Team, who had managed to battle their
                                            way into the top four of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. As such, he was
                                            extremely courteous as he replied: “Hold on a moment, let me check for
                                            you.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he lifted his hand and swiped it across the large gem on the
                                            side, and a strange sight appeared as the gem lit up in a dim gold light,
                                            and an image appeared on it.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s jaw dropped as he stared in shock. “What is that?!”</p>
                                        <p>The employee said proudly with a slight smile: “This is an invention by our
                                            Skill Storing Palace, and can only be found here. It consists of the
                                            Spatial, Light and Darkness Attributes, and our own specialised sealing
                                            formations and some other secret techniques to create this unique gemstone.
                                            It allows us to store images and information, and it is extremely convenient
                                            for us to search through it. [1. Woohoo! Magic Database!] We call it the
                                            Lustre Gem.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, an array of light appeared as he continued controlling the
                                            device. Turning back to Zhou Weiqing, the employee said: “Alright, there are
                                            twenty seven Heavenly Beasts in total with the Time Attribute, of which
                                            twelve are of the Shi Stage, eight of the Zun Stage, seven of the Zong Stage
                                            or higher. You can actually check on their Skills and their effects and
                                            power here before you decide on which one you would like to try Storing, and
                                            that will save a lot of your time. Once you have chosen, we will send
                                            someone to send you to the corresponding Skill Storing Chamber. Here in our
                                            ZhongTian Skill Storing Palace, every of our Heavenly Beasts have their own
                                            personal chambers, even the lowest staged ones.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in surprise: “Every Heavenly Beast has their own
                                            chamber? That must have taken so work, effort and space!”</p>
                                        <p>The employee smiled faintly, saying: “This must be your first time in our
                                            ZhongTian City right? This is actually not a secret, but the entire
                                            underground, 300 metres below the ZhongTian Plaza, it is all actually part
                                            of our Skill Storing Palace. We have the capacity to hold more than three
                                            thousand different Heavenly Beasts!”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, Zhou Weiqing sucked in a cold breath. What sort of wealth
                                            was needed to splurge like that?! Sigh… the Heavenly Bow Empire did not even
                                            have a Skill Storing Palace, yet look at their Skill Storing Palace over
                                            here. This was truly the power of the top Empire… Envy, Jealousy, Hate!</p>
                                        <p>After a moment of surprise, Zhou Weiqing focused his gaze on the gemstone
                                            screen, looking through the options as he prepared to choose two Time
                                            Attribute Skills to Store. If he could manage to gain two power Time
                                            Attribute Skills, it would undoubtedly be a huge benefit to their team
                                            effort in the upcoming matches.</p>
                                        <p>“If you still have Elemental Jewels which have not gone through Skill
                                            Storing, I recommend that you hold off temporarily for now.” Just as Zhou
                                            Weiqing was looking through the options, a familiar voice rang out from
                                            behind him. At the same time, the employee beside him was already bowing at
                                            a ninety degree respectful bow from the waist.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing turned in surprise to see that Shangguan Longyin and appeared
                                            behind him unknowingly, smiling at him.</p>
                                        <p>“Hello, Senior Shangguan.” Towards Shangguan Longyin, he definitely had a
                                            very favourable impression.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin waved towards the employee, who quickly moved back to the
                                            far end, leaving the two alone.</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, I have reported your terms to the two Palace Masters, and they have
                                            considered it very seriously. Unfortunately, we do not have any dragons, and
                                            are not able to meet that. Second Palace Master also indicated that he will
                                            not use Third Miss’ marriage as a bargaining chip.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded rather indifferently, saying: “I understand. That’s
                                            alright then.” He had a firm grasp on psychology, and he knew that in
                                            bargaining, he could not show any sign of urgency, only then would he be
                                            able to gain the greatest benefit.</p>
                                        <p>As expected, Shangguan Longyin quickly said: “Wait, don’t be so hasty, let me
                                            finish. The two Palace Masters said that if you are willing to sell your
                                            Immortal Deity Technique to us, we can use three God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls to trade with you, and we can even specially design them
                                            for you. At the same time, we can let you stay in the Heavenly Jewel Island
                                            as long as you want, and the Heavenly Jewel Island’s Skill Storing Palace
                                            Headquarters will also be available for you to go through Skill Storing as
                                            necessary.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Shangguan Longyin’s words, Zhou Weiqing almost drooled with glee.
                                            Originally, he had thought that after much bargaining, he might be able to
                                            get a single custom made God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll, and that
                                            would be a great profit for him. Unexpectedly, their first counter offer had
                                            already been a direct three, with the added free Skill Storing! Without
                                            question, the Heavenly Beasts on the Heavenly Jewel Island were likely to be
                                            even better than those of the ZhongTian Skill Storing Palace, and this was
                                            perhaps why Shangguan Longyin had stopped him from choosing earlier.</p>
                                        <p>The trade terms were so good that Zhou Weiqing was unable to reject them, and
                                            even his thick skin was unable to continue conning them further. In order to
                                            calm himself down, he did not agree at once, instead asking: “Senior
                                            Shangguan, what does this staying on the Heavenly Jewel Island as long as I
                                            want mean?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin said: “That is actually a right that only the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace main bloodline has. Basically, what it means is as long as
                                            you want, you can leave and return to the Heavenly Jewel Island anytime you
                                            want, and nobody will stop you. Simply put, you will have an ‘infinite
                                            Heavenly Jewel Plaque’, or in other words, you will be considered a part of
                                            the Heavenly Jewel Island, but without any restrictions on your freedom.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, the reason why Shangguan Longyin was here to speak to Zhou Weiqing
                                            today was because the two Palace Masters had discussed Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            situation in detail, examining every scrap of knowledge they had about this
                                            youth.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue had not expected that this son-in-law to be of his actually
                                            had such an outstanding talent. Although he had not gone through any proper
                                            training of Heavenly Jewel Masters from a young age, and could be said to be
                                            extremely lacking in that sense, he had already achieved an unbelievable
                                            height after a mere three years of his Heavenly Jewels Awakening! That was
                                            already more than comparable to any of their main disciples or bloodline, in
                                            fact, perhaps not just in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, but even the other
                                            Great Saint Lands too. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing was still only seventeen
                                            years old, and he had a great future ahead indeed.</p>
                                        <p>When Shangguan Tianyue had heard Shangguan Xue’er’s report to him, he had
                                            finally acknowledged this son-in-law to-be of his, at least on a primary
                                            level for now. Soon after, Shangguan Longyin had came back with news about
                                            the cultivation technique of his and the willingness to do a trade. After
                                            much discussion between Shangguan Tianyue and his elder brother, the First
                                            Palace Master Shangguan Tianyang, they had finally came to such a
                                            decision.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, the terms given by the Heaven’s Expanse Palace were highly
                                            advantageous, almost unbelievably good. It could be said that they did not
                                            bother bargaining, directly offering him their maximum bottom line. First of
                                            all, they wanted to see what Zhou Weiqing’s character was like facing such a
                                            huge enticement, and the other reason, perhaps more importantly, was to have
                                            an excuse to officially train and develop Zhou Weiqing properly, and to also
                                            keep him on good terms with the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. After all, the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace was extremely huge, and though the two Palace
                                            Masters might have absolute power and say, they still needed to consider how
                                            their subordinates would think.</p>
                                        <p>After listening to Shangguan Longyin’s words, Zhou Weiqing paused for a
                                            moment, deep in thought, before finally saying: “I’d like to thank Senior
                                            Shangguan and both Palace Masters for their kindness and generosity. With
                                            such favourable conditions, if I do not accept, I would be much too greedy.
                                            However, I do have a small request - I do not require designing custom God
                                            Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls as I have several designs in hand. I
                                            myself am actually a Consolidating Equipment Master, and I hope that the
                                            three sets of God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls can be according to
                                            the designs I have. At the same time, I also hope that I can watch during
                                            the creation of the three sets. Besides that, I am extremely happy with all
                                            the conditions.”</p>
                                        <p>“You… you have God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll designs?! Could it be
                                            … a Legendary Set?” Shangguan Longyin exclaimed, looking at him in
                                            surprise.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, saying: “As you have seen, I already have a God Tier
                                            Consolidated Equipment, and that is the first piece of my Legendary Set. As
                                            such, I will definitely only Consolidate the other pieces of my Legendary
                                            Set in order to complete it.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin nodded, saying: “That is not a big problem. Of course, if
                                            you have the designs it is even better, and will save us much trouble too.
                                            However, to watch our Masters at work, that might be difficult. After all,
                                            God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters have very high status in the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island, and even our Palace Masters aren’t able to order them
                                            to do anything they do not want. This will depend on your own luck; we can
                                            put forth the request to the Masters who will work on your sets, but whether
                                            or not they agree is up to them. If they do agree, that will be good; but if
                                            they do not agree, we will think of something else to compensate you
                                            with.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not hesitate any further, smiling as he said: “Alright, then
                                            I fully accept all the terms of the trade. Even if the Seniors do not wish
                                            to, then that is fine.”</p>
                                        <p>With Zhou Weiqing providing his own designs, it was much easier than
                                            customizing a design for him. Furthermore, by using his design, the God Tier
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master would naturally be able to remember it, and
                                            it would actually be a benefit to the Heavenly Jewel Island! As such, that
                                            was the reason why Shangguan Longyin said they would compensate him.”</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing was extremely clear about that point. As a
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master himself, how could he not know about the
                                            importance and value of a Legendary Set design? However, he would not take
                                            out the entire set of designs, no matter how much money or favourable
                                            trades, he would never do so. After all, he had to ensure that this
                                            Legendary Set of his was unique, and one of a kind. This was his teacher
                                            Huyan Ao’s teaching lineage’s Founder’s fruit of painstaking labour, and was
                                            a top quality work that could possibly make history. How could he possibly
                                            sell or trade it away?</p>
                                        <p>Of course, if it were only three designs out of the entire set, that would
                                            not be a big problem as the overall secret of the entire set would still be
                                            kept. With those three sets of Scrolls, it would be more than sufficient to
                                            tide him over until he reached the six-Jeweled cultivation level. By that
                                            time, he was also confident that his own Consolidating Equipment Master
                                            skills would be polished to a new height, and perhaps he wouldn’t be far
                                            from creating his own equipment by then. After all, some of the earlier
                                            Scrolls in the Sets did not totally require a God Tier Jewel Master power,
                                            with only a Zong Stage Jewel Master power required.</p>
                                        <p>Even though Zhou Weiqing had an incredible talent on his Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master cultivation, he had never given up on the dream of becoming a God
                                            Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. After all, his goal was not just an
                                            ordinary fighter, an ordinary adventurer, but a leader, a leader who would
                                            bring his Empire to new heights. With the draw that a Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master brought to Jewel Masters, it was much more than being any
                                            ordinary powerhouse. He had already felt that deeply even as just a mere Mid
                                            Level Consolidating Equipment Master, experiencing first hand how important
                                            such a master could be. With that, how could he possibly give up such an
                                            important step to his dream? Furthermore, he held the hopes and dreams of
                                            his teacher Huyan Aobo as well, and he had given his promise.</p>
                                        <p>As such, after some quick thought, Zhou Weiqing had added the request of
                                            watching the creation. No matter how good having the scrolls were, it would
                                            be even better if he could learn how to create them himself, and watching a
                                            God Tier Consolidating Master create them would definitely teach him
                                            something, paving the road for his future as an outstanding God Tier
                                            Consolidating Master of his own. Still, he did not want to add too many
                                            requests, at least trying to give the impression that he was honest, many
                                            naive. After all, his Immortal Deity Technique perhaps wasn’t worth that
                                            much! If not for his relationship with Shangguan Bing’er, perhaps he would
                                            be afraid that they would renege on the deal after realising the true nature
                                            of the technique.</p>
                                        <p>How could poor Shangguan Longyin know that this honest looking youth in front
                                            of him, who was in truth more shrewd and cunning than a monkey, had already
                                            calculated so much. Seeing that Zhou Weiqing did not try to add anymore
                                            conditions, he immediately felt the impression of the youth increase another
                                            notch.</p>
                                        <p>Just in the time that they were discussing, the other three Battle Teams had
                                            slowly arrived one by one. These three teams stood at a distance from one
                                            another, without any discourse between one another, though they glared icily
                                            at each other once in a while.</p>
                                        <p></p>
