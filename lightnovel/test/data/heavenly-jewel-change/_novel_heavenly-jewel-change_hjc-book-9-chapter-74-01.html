                                            in Jiang Fei’s own eyes, it was the Thousand Lightning Strikes that caused
                                            her to slow down.</p>
                                        <p>Crow’s power was finally able to be unleashed to its maximum potential, and
                                            the ‘Heaven Destruction’ effect on the Legendary Axes made its already
                                            powerful strikes even more formidable. The huge axes in her hands were
                                            swirling and dancing around like two huge fans; Wu Zhengyang’s Heavy Sword
                                            was also strong, with his Elemental Jewel Skills in combination… but paled
                                            in front of the two legendary axes.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Wu Zhengyang was already unable to keep up with Crow’s attacks,
                                            no matter in terms of speed or power. Now that he was abruptly struck and
                                            numbed by the Thousand Lightning Strikes from Zhou Weiqing, the victory was
                                            easily decided.</p>
                                        <p>*BOOM* The ‘Heaven Destruction’ and Legendary Axes smashed apart the
                                            Shimmering Light Shield once more.</p>
                                        <p>This time, Zhou Weiqing did not make any mistakes. Once more, the lightning
                                            fast drawing and release of the Overlord Bow, as arrow after arrow streamed
                                            towards Jiang Fei. As long as they won this 2v2 match, they would take this
                                            entire series and finish it today. As such, Zhou Weiqing did not hold back
                                            at all, circulating his Heavenly Energy to its maximum, and placing the
                                            Spatial Shackles skill onto the arrows.</p>
                                        <p>If Jiang Fei was not affected by the Absolute Delay, with her power, she
                                            could easily handle his incoming attacks. Alas, the three seconds duration
                                            of the Absolute Delay played its critical part in this time-sensitive fight,
                                            and the arrows struck.</p>
                                        <p>Earlier, Jiang Fei could still use her own attacks to take them down, but
                                            with her speed slowed down considerably, she was finally hit by an arrow.
                                            Although it wasn’t able to damage her at all, protected by her considerable
                                            Heavenly Energy as she was, the effect of the Spatial Shackles still landed
                                            upon her. That was the entire lynchpin of Zhou Weiqing’s plan; to not allow
                                            her to rescue Wu Zhengyang from Crow.</p>
                                        <p>Right after Crow had destroyed his Shimmering Light Shield, Wu Zhengyang
                                            recovered from his paralysis. After all, his cultivation level was higher
                                            than Zhou Weiqing’s, and the Thousand Lightning Strikes’ offense wasn’t
                                            great, thus the paralysis wouldn’t last for long. Alas, by that time it was
                                            already too late, as Crow had already charged in front of him, her axes
                                            hurtling down towards him.</p>
                                        <p>Wu Zhengyang had already experienced Crow’s terrifying strength first hand in
                                            his previous fight, and he immediately knew he could not take that blow head
                                            on. Immediately, he backpedalled, the Heavy Sword in his hands striking
                                            upwards in an attempted parry. At the same time, he also unleashed a
                                            protective skill, as gold light shone forth from his body and covering
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>Unfortunately, all his efforts were to no avail. As Crow’s axes smashed down,
                                            Wu Zhengyang’s Consolidated Heavy Sword was knocked out of his hands, and
                                            Crow swiftly took another step forward and launched a heavy kick. History
                                            seemed to repeat itself, as her foot lashed out and struck his shield. Next,
                                            the exact same 'deja vu' moment recycled itself as the sorrowful Wu
                                            Zhengyang flew back like a cannon ball, landing in same spot he had in the
                                            first fight. The protective skill had indeed protected him, especially since
                                            Crow had not tried to deal any lethal damage, but it definitely did not
                                            protect his ‘face’. This time, he had not been taken by surprise, and it was
                                            Crow who had overpowered him totally.</p>
                                        <p>Crow had just finished dealing with Wu Zhengyang, and at the other side, the
                                            Absolute Delay on Jiang Fei had just worn off when she was enveloped in the
                                            silver glow of the Spatial Shackles.</p>
                                        <p>The eyes of this young lady, with her ice cold countenance, flashed with an
                                            even colder light as a resolute glow filled them. Just as the Absolute Delay
                                            effect ended, and she was still in the Spatial Shackles, the black staff in
                                            her hands shattered into pieces.</p>
                                        <p>That was right. Shattered. Not withdrawn. As soon as the staff shattered, it
                                            split into a large mass of swirling thick black light, gathering around her
                                            palms.</p>
                                        <p>With a soft pop, blood spurted out of Jiang Fei’s mouth, spraying onto the
                                            black light in front of her. The next moment, the other four Consolidated
                                            Equipment she was wearing glowed with a brilliant light, and the Spatial
                                            Shackles dissolved instantly. Zhou Weiqing’s following arrows seemed to be
                                            steered by a mysterious force, melding into the black light and dissolving
                                            as well, and none of the Skills imbued within were even given the chance to
                                            activate.</p>
                                        <p>In the corner of the stage, the judge’s expression suddenly changed. Lifting
                                            his left hand, six brilliant glowing Star Sapphires appeared as he quickly
                                            summoned his Elemental Jewels, instantly releasing twelve solid Ice Shields
                                            in front of himself.</p>
                                        <p>“Crow, come back now!” Zhou Weiqing shouted, instantly keeping his Overlord
                                            Bow.</p>
                                        <p>Crow had lifted her axes in preparation to attack, but hearing Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            voice, she started, looking back at him puzzledly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shouted: “Quick, jump off the stage.” As he said that, he was
                                            afraid Crow wouldn’t react in time, and his right leg struck the ground,
                                            leaping towards her and grabbing her arm before jumping off the stage and
                                            dragging her along.</p>
                                        <p>Crow did not know why Zhou Weiqing was doing this, but she did not resist his
                                            pull as he jumped down. Their feet had just touched the ground when they
                                            felt an unbelievably thick, cold aura blaze into air right above their
                                            heads, filled with the scent of blood and darkness. The entire plaza seemed
                                            to darken for a moment, before the sun once again shone upon them.</p>
                                        <p>Looking back at the stage, they saw Jiang Fei with an ashen pale face,
                                            standing dazedly, swaying as if she was about to faint at any moment. The
                                            Consolidated Equipment she had worn had now disappeared. On the stage, a
                                            huge, nearly thirty yard diameter hole had appeared, and the entire stage
                                            was now nearly destroyed.</p>
                                        <p>Without Zhou Weiqing’s explanation, Crow immediately understood why he had
                                            pulled her down. That attack of Jiang Fei’s was just too fiercely
                                            terrifying. If they had not jumped off the stage in time, even if they had
                                            managed to survive that blow, they would definitely be heavily injured.</p>
                                        <p>“So fierce?” Crow muttered to herself.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shuddered in trepidation as he thought back retrospectively,
                                            before saying: “The Darkness Attribute’s most overbearing self sacrifice
                                            skill… just like Xiao Yan’s Flame of Life where he burned his life force.
                                            How can it not be fierce? She was already putting her life on the line, if
                                            we didn’t run, we would just be waiting for death.”</p>
                                        <p>At the other side of the competitors stage, the judge was also in bad shape.
                                            Although he at the six-Jeweled cultivation level, and Jiang Fei had not
                                            targeted the skill at him, he was still caught by the backlash. All twelve
                                            of his ice shields had been shattered, and his face was pale as he
                                            forcefully restrained himself from vomiting blood. Just like Xiao Yan, this
                                            was a five-Jeweled level of self sacrifice skill… but do not forget that
                                            Jiang Fei’s Attribute was a greater attribute, and she was also an ultimate
                                            offense type Heavenly Jewel Master!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing made a quick comparison in his heart, and estimated that this
                                            Jiang Fei’s offensive capabilities were even greater than Xiao Yan’s,
                                            although her combat expertise and experience were perhaps lower than Xiao
                                            Yan. Overall, their total strength might be somewhat equal. If he had to
                                            deal with her on a one vs one fight, he might actually have an eighty
                                            percent chance of losing, unless he used his Demonic Change to secure the
                                            win. With the huge difference in power, Control Skills had limits on their
                                            power. Zhou Weiqing was starting to understand why Tang Xian had said his
                                            Absolute Delay was so unbelievable after all.</p>
                                        <p>The judge finally suppressed his injuries, and he said solemnly: “Third
                                            match, 2 vs 2. Mi’Ou Battle Team’s victory.”</p>
                                        <p>Jiang Fei looked coldly at Zhou Weiqing standing below before saying coldly:
                                            “Coward.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh, beautiful lady, the saying goes that
                                            bimbos have large breasts and no brains, but your breasts aren’t large but
                                            your brains aren’t much to speak off! Why should I be so reckless as to take
                                            your blow for no reason? Earlier, we already won two fights, so we can
                                            afford to lose this one. Since you already used the Self Sacrifice skill,
                                            you will not be able to join the future fights. If you have the ability, you
                                            can always send out another member of your Mi’Ou Battle Team as powerful as
                                            yourself. Since I am confident of winning anyway, why should I risk
                                            potential injury or death to take your bow? Do I look that stupid to you?
                                            I’m very scared of dying you know? Anyway, come on, who’s fighting the
                                            fourth fight.”</p>
                                        <p>“You….. shameless!” Jiang Fei’s face turned even whiter, as she vomited
                                            another mouthful of blood with a *Wah* sound.</p>
                                        <p>Wu Zhengyang and Zhu HeiSan quickly jumped up onto the stage, supporting
                                            Jiang Fei as they glared at Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave an innocent look as he shrugged: “What… is being scared of
                                            death against the law? You’ve already won this fight, why do you still say
                                            I’m shameless? That’s called strategy!”</p>
                                        <p>“Both sides, please get off the stage, we will need to repair it.” The
                                            judge’s rather gloomy voice sounded out.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled at Jiang Fei and said: “Beautiful lady, I’ll see you
                                            later then.” As such, he headed back to the Rest House.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he entered the Rest House, the smile on his face vanished as he
                                            sucked in a deep breath, saying to the other three members: “What a
                                            terrifying self sacrifice skill… what a powerful ultimate offense Heavenly
                                            jewel Master. Just now, I saw that the stage was still being corroded and
                                            eaten away constantly, lucky we dodged the attack just now.”</p>
                                        <p>Crow said curiously: “Weiqing, do you also know this Self Sacrifice skill?”
                                            She knew that Zhou Weiqing also had the Darkness Attribute. [1. My memory
                                            must be failing me… anyone know when she found out?]”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said with a bitter smile: “No, I do not. Each and every self
                                            sacrifice type skill are all secret techniques, they are a learned skill,
                                            not Elemental Jewel Stored Skills. I do not have any teachers in that
                                            matter, nor have I researched into it myself, so I naturally do not know. I
                                            am sure that my dad knows though, in the future I will learn it from him.
                                            Earlier, when I dragged you down the stage, it was actually because of the
                                            judge’s reactions. His shocked face, his quick summoning of his defenses… as
                                            a six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master trusted to be the judge, if he has such
                                            a reaction, naturally it will be something we will find extremely difficult
                                            to handle. That was the main reason why I guessed it was a self sacrifice
                                            skill.”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao furrowed his brow and said: “This Mi’Ou Battle Team is surprisingly
                                            tough, if their other team members are just as strong, we will be in deep
                                            trouble.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “The Mi’Ou Empire might be stronger
                                            than my Heavenly Bow Empire, but not by such a huge margin, and is
                                            definitely weaker than the Fei Li Empire. For it to have one or two geniuses
                                            is not surprising, but if a large number of geniuses appear, I’m sure that
                                            their surrounding empires will be the first to react. Do not worry, I am
                                            very confident that Jiang Fei is their strongest member, and none of their
                                            other members will be as powerful as even Wu Zhengyang.</p>
                                        <p>That fight was probably the most exciting, most violent fight of the
                                            tournament thus far; having even the entire stage destroyed!</p>
                                        <p>In all the battle teams’ respective Rest Houses, all the members were
                                            discussing the fight. Without question, Jiang Fei’s power had totally
                                            eclipsed Zhou Weiqing and Crow’s light, and could be said to have
                                            overshadowed everyone thus far. A Darkness Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master
                                            who knew the self sacrifice skill was definitely a terrifying force,
                                            furthermore she was an ultimate offense type Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
