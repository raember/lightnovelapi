                                            the same level, even I will not be Bro Long’s match. As such, let’s have Bro
                                            Long be at the limit of nine-Jewels while testing Yingbing. In such an
                                            arrangement, Yingbing will be able to fully spark his potential as well. As
                                            for Zhou Weiqing, he is at the six-Jeweled cultivation level, and should
                                            have already learned Bro Long’s Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation.
                                            In addition to that, as I said previously, Yingbing will be given some
                                            advantage in the test. As such, the Lion King can test Zhou Weiqing at the
                                            limit of eight Jewels. How does that sound to both of you?”</p>
                                        <p>“I do not agree.” Long Shiya said without hesitation, his face angry. “Old
                                            Monster Xue, that is too obviously a bias. What difference is there from a
                                            eight-Jeweled Lion King and a nine-Jeweled Gu Yingbing? In that case, we
                                            might as well let the two youths fight each other. Who needs your so-called
                                            fairness?”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian smiled and said: “Bro Long, hold your horses, let me finish.
                                            During the entire process of the test, both Bro Long and the Lion King are
                                            not allowed to use any of your Consolidated Equipment. You can only use your
                                            Elemental Jewel Skills. Alright, now, that is fair right?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, Long Shiya couldn’t help but be slightly surprised.
                                            Indeed, if it were the Lion King restricted at Eight Jewels and not allowed
                                            to use any Consolidated Equipment, then he would be slightly weaker than Gu
                                            Yingbing who could use everything in his arsenal. As for himself, even if he
                                            did not use any Consolidated Equipment, just with his Six Ultimate Skill
                                            Manipulation Formation alone at the nine-Jeweled cultivation level, he was
                                            confident of taking down Gu Yingbing fairly quickly.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that Long Shiya was no longer protesting, Xue AoTian turned to the
                                            Lion King questioningly.</p>
                                        <p>Almost without thinking, Gu Site immediately nodded. As a King of an entire
                                            Empire, how could he not have faith in himself? Even if he could only use
                                            the Elemental Jewels, his restricted strength would still mean he would be
                                            two Jewels higher than the little brat. Furthermore, do not forget that as
                                            the King of the WanShou Empire, in terms of Skill Storing, he was definitely
                                            at the top of the entire world. It could be said that all the Skills that he
                                            had Stored were amongst the most powerful. Furthermore, he had many years of
                                            combat experience, and Gu Site was absolutely confident in himself. As for
                                            his son, although he knew Long Shiya was strong, without the use of his
                                            Consolidated Equipment, he felt that Gu Yingbing would be able to hold on
                                            for enough time.</p>
                                        <p>This competition was no longer a competition between Zhou Weiqing and Gu
                                            Yingbing; it had also become a competition between Long Shiya and Gu
                                            Site!</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian looked at both sides and said: “This round, both the Tiger King
                                            and myself will be the judge. Bro Long, Lion King, I will now start to place
                                            the Seal on you both.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya gave a cold laugh and said: “Old Monster Xue, no need for my Seal.
                                            This is your Heavenly Snow Mountain, how can I possibly trust you with that?
                                            With you at the side judging, are you still afraid that I will use any
                                            Heavenly Energy above ninth Jewel? Well, on the other hand, that Lion King,
                                            you better Seal him, otherwise who knows what he will do with his
                                            character.”</p>
                                        <p>The Lion King immediately retorted angrily: “Fatty Long, you dare say that
                                            about my character?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said arily: “Whose character is bad, we know by ourselves. Stop
                                            acting with that rash face, you think this old man still can’t see through
                                            all your acts? Otherwise, I wouldn’t be called the Six Ultimate Heavenly
                                            Emperor. You fake old lion, better be careful, with only an eight-Jeweled
                                            cultivation, you better not stumble and capsize before my disciple. Heh heh,
                                            we’ll see then if you still have the face to remain King.”</p>
                                        <p>“You…” Gu Site’s eyes turned cold, as he snapped out of that ‘rash anger’ he
                                            had been acting with. Coldly, he said: “Very good, Six Ultimate Heavenly
                                            Emperor. We shall see who is the one who actually fails miserably and
                                            capsizes in a storm drain!”</p>
                                        <p>At Xue AoTian’s signal, both sides slowly separated. In the end, Xue AoTian
                                            really did not Seal Long Shiya, but he still personally Sealed the Lion
                                            King, with the excuse of not allowing outsiders to call them out. The judges
                                            were then split as well, with the Tiger King keeping watch on the Lion King
                                            and Zhou Weiqing, while Xue AoTian personally kept watch on Long Shiya
                                            against Gu Yingbing. As such, the second test was finally ready and about to
                                            begin.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since Xue AoTian had revealed the details of the second competition,
                                            Zhou Weiqing had been keeping silent at the side, waiting for the test to
                                            start without making a sound. He did not bother thinking about the third
                                            test, or when that might happen. Everything depended on getting through this
                                            fight first. As such, he now placed full attention on the Lion King Gu
                                            Site.</p>
                                        <p>Facing a Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse, Zhou Weiqing dared not be
                                            careless at all. Although the rules were that the Lion King could only use
                                            Heavenly Energy up to the eight-Jeweled stage, but Zhou Weiqing still
                                            decided to treat him as a Heavenly Emperor. In the midst of the dim light
                                            falling upon him, Zhou Weiqing’s face was grave and solemn. Although he had
                                            just gained an unexpected benefit earlier, facing the King of the entire
                                            WanShou Empire, he could only do his best, put his all, and the result could
                                            only depend on how well he could bring all his powers into play against the
                                            restrained Lion King.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian looked at both sides. The Lion King and Zhou Weiqing were about
                                            ten yards apart, and the same case for Long Shiya and Gu Yingbing. At such a
                                            distance, towards people of their caliber, any Skill would already be
                                            effective. Any attack would be able to work from there, crushing down with
                                            irresistible force, and it would be up to the other to handle it. This was a
                                            good starting distance indeed.</p>
                                        <p>“Begin.” At last, Xue AoTian shouted the word out loud, and both sides sprang
                                            into action as combat began.</p>
                                        <p>For the sake of his precious disciple, Long Shiya did not hold back at all.
                                            Instantly, six coloured lights rose from his body, flashing brightly. His
                                            Heavenly Jewels rose and spun over his head as his Six Ultimate Skill
                                            Manipulation Formation was unleashed. Instantly, a vast amount of
                                            atmospheric Heavenly Energy gathered around him, as well as his Six
                                            Attribute powers, revolving around Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian was watching from the side all this while. From Long Shiya, he
                                            could only sense the Heavenly Energy of the Nine-Jeweled stage. Of course,
                                            Long Shiya did not hesitate to use the Max Level Nine Jeweled stage, not the
                                            Low Level Nine Jeweled Stage that Gu Yingbing currently was.</p>
                                        <p>As the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation sprang up around Long Shiya,
                                            Gu Yingbing did not remain idle. He did not bother attempting to use his
                                            Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura to slowly block the Six Ultimate
                                            Heavenly Emperor’s attack individually. He had long since heard from Xue
                                            AoTian before that Long Shiya’s fighting style was extremely different from
                                            any other ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master. In a fight, if you gave Long Shiya
                                            any advantage, his offense would then be a crazed flurry like the cascading
                                            waters of a raging river. With the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation
                                            Formation, he did not have any cooldown or waiting time, and even the
                                            smallest, tiniest Skill… in Long Shiya’s hands it would be at full power,
                                            maximum effect. Even when Xue AoTian was facing Long Shiya, he did not dare
                                            to let him get a good head start and build up momentum… Let alone Gu
                                            Yingbing now.</p>
                                        <p>As such, as soon as the fight started, Gu Yingbing did not hesitate to
                                            unleash all of his Consolidated Equipment. Six God Tier Consolidated
                                            Equipment and three Zong Stage Consolidated Equipment appeared around his
                                            body instantly, all nine of his current possible Consolidated Equipment.</p>
                                        <p>A resplendent gold light of his Equipment mixed with the dark-gold light of
                                            the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura, and Gu Yingbing’s aura was
                                            extended to the max. From just the outward appearance of the intensity of
                                            lights alone, even Long Shiya was lesser than he was currently.</p>
                                        <p>However, just from the Consolidated Equipment that Gu Yingbing had summoned,
                                            one could see the difference between the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain’s advantage and superiority lay in its vast
                                            numbers of powerful Heavenly Beasts, which also led to them having a massive
                                            advantage in Skill Storing. More so, with these Heavenly Beasts, though they
                                            might not be able to attack out so easily, protecting themselves was a
                                            guarantee. Otherwise, they might have been long since crushed by the other
                                            four Great Saint Lands.</p>
                                        <p>However, in terms of wealth, The Heavenly Snow Mountain was no match at all
                                            for the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Do not forget that Gu Yingbing was the Lion
                                            Prince, not only was he the Crown Prince of the entire WanShou Empire,
                                            though he had given up the position as heir to the throne for now, but he
                                            was also the main disciple to the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord! It was
                                            without a doubt that the Lion King Gu Site had placed so much hope on this
                                            eldest son of his, and even under such a circumstance, with Gu Yingbing
                                            reaching the Ninth Jewel Stage, he was still only able to have six God Tier
                                            Consolidated Equipment instead of all nine. From that, one could just
                                            imagine how lacking the WanShou Empire were in terms of Consolidated
                                            Equipment.</p>
                                        <p>If it were any of the main or core disciples of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace,
                                            for example of Shangguan Fei’er reached the Nine-Jeweled stage… she would
                                            definitely have nine pieces of an entire Legendary Set. If the Legendary Set
                                            only had nine pieces in total, then she would have already completed the
                                            entire set at this stage… and her future Consolidated Equipment would surely
                                            still be God Tier Consolidated Equipment.</p>
                                        <p>The sheer difference between an entire Legendary Set of Consolidated
                                            Equipment as compared to just nine ordinary pieces of even God Tier
                                            Consolidated Equipment was like Heaven and Earth. If Gu Yingbing really had
                                            an entire Set like that, then perhaps even a restrained Long Shiya who could
                                            only use the nine-Jeweled Heavenly Energy and not his own ‘Hate Sky No
                                            Handle’ Legendary Set would be hard pressed to take him on. Perhaps even to
                                            the extent of having a chance of losing! After all, the boost of an entire
                                            Legendary Set was just too terrifying.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, under the current circumstance, a six piece Legendary Set of God
                                            Tier Consolidated Equipment still brought quite a massive advantage, but
                                            compared to Long Shiya’s Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation, it was
                                            still just not enough. Of course, Gu Yingbing had already brought out all of
                                            his current power and was in tip top condition for this fight.</p>
                                        <p>After unleashing all his Consolidated Equipment, Gu Yingbing instantly
                                            launched his own attacks. In a flash, he already appeared in midair. A
                                            distance of ten yards, it was perfect for him to strike out with the large
                                            gold long cudgel which had appeared in his hands. An earsplitting whistle as
                                            he smashed through the air alongside a massive surge of Heavenly Energy that
                                            morphed in a gold blur smashing out at Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>In his first attack, Gu Yingbing had already used his strongest Divine
                                            Attribute. Having a Saint Attribute was his greatest weapon, and without a
                                            doubt he had to go all out from the start. He could only win this round, or
                                            hold out for a longer time than Zhou Weiqing, only then would he smash
                                            through all the barriers between him and Tian’er as his wife.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, Zhou Weiqing’s thoughts on this fight was almost identical
                                            to Gu Yingbing. Both youths could be said to have set full resolve to pit
                                            their lives in this fight. They did not focus on the ‘opposing’ side at all,
                                            only focusing all their attention on their own fight. At least, even if they
                                            lost in the end, they had to have given their all. Only then could they have
                                            no regrets in this competition.</p>
