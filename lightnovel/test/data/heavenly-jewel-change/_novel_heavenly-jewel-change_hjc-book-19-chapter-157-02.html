                                            main army to move in.</p>
                                        <p>However, the Gold Crow Tribe and the Berserker Tribe had been too huge and
                                            obvious a target, especially with so many horse carts in tow. To the two
                                            Regiments, it was like a huge piece of delicious meat dangling in front of
                                            them, and how could they resist? Naturally, they charged to the attack,
                                            making full use of their speed and movement, swiftly encircling and
                                            surrounding the two tribes. The Peerless Battalion had some scouts in the
                                            area, and had quickly realised things were going badly and quickly
                                            dispatched men back to request aid. Things were indeed not going well over
                                            there.</p>
                                        <p>“Big Bro Wei, do you know anything about the Unicorn Tribe Regiment?” Zhou
                                            Weiqing asked Wei Feng.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng’s expression was grave and solemn as he said: “The Unicorn Tribe
                                            Regiment is extremely powerful. In terms of speed, they are no lesser than
                                            the Wolf Cavalry troops, but in terms of combat capabilities, they surpass
                                            the Wolf Cavalry troops. The Unicorns are similar in look to your Ghost
                                            Demon Horse, but are even larger. Each Unicorn has an inborn talent of
                                            gliding; although they are not actually able to fly, these powerful beasts
                                            are able to glide in the air for about a hundred metres, using the small
                                            wings they have behind their backs. The Unicorn Beastmen are also known as
                                            the beastmen with the greatest combat skill, stronger than the Wolfmen and
                                            extremely skilled in using long spears on horseback. The Gliding Charge of
                                            the Unicorn Cavalry Troops is so powerful that even the Heavy Cavalry of our
                                            ZhongTian armies are unable to withstand it at full charge. Furthermore,
                                            they are also skilled archers, and are much better at harassing than even
                                            the Wolf Cavalry troops. In the entire WanShou Empire, the Unicorn Cavalry
                                            troops are counted amongst the absolute elite, and they only number two
                                            Regiments. I never expected we would meet one of them so early.”</p>
                                        <p><i>Archer Cavalry Units? </i>Upon hearing that, Zhou Weiqing’s brow furrowed
                                            once more. That would mean that even the Peerless Battalion Air Force would
                                            not be absolutely safe.</p>
                                        <p>However, he did not have any other choice but to rescue the Gold Crow Tribe
                                            and Berserker Tribes. At this point, he could only hope that the two Tribes
                                            were sufficiently powerful enough to hold their own, and only by working
                                            with them could they have a chance to repulse to two enemy Regiments and
                                            retreat to safety.</p>
                                        <p>Two hundred li was nothing in the eyes of the swift cavalry, and two hours of
                                            swift galloping ensured they reached their destination.</p>
                                        <p>In the distance, the sounds of fighting, metal clashing against each other,
                                            and the air of killing intent filled the atmosphere. The chaos of the battle
                                            in the distance was clear, but they could not see anything for sure.</p>
                                        <p>“Peerless battalion, get ready for battle. Remember to conserve your Heavenly
                                            Energy.” Zhou Weiqing shouted out loud.</p>
                                        <p>As they got closer, when Zhou Weiqing could finally see the actual
                                            battleground. No matter him, or the other Peerless Battalion soldiers, were
                                            absolutely surprised.</p>
                                        <p>The fight was not on the original hillside that the Peerless Battalion had
                                            once camped one. The Gold Crow Tribe and Berserker Tribe had not even
                                            bothered to retreat to the tunnel network that the Peerless Battalion had
                                            dug, instead being fully surrounded by the two WanShou Empire Regiments in
                                            the vast open plains. However, the reason why the Peerless Battalion was so
                                            surprised was that from the outlook of the battleground situation, both
                                            sides were pretty much locked in a stalemate, and not the WanShou Empire
                                            armies having a large advantage as expected.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said to Zhou Weiqing: “I’ll go ahead and scout a bit first.”
                                            As she said that, she spread her wings and soared off into the sky. The
                                            battlefield was extremely messy, and it was nearly impossible for them to
                                            look clearly from their perspective and direction, and could only see that
                                            the fighting ahead was violent and fierce.</p>
                                        <p>In a matter of moments, Shangguan Fei’er had returned. Zhou Weiqing was
                                            surprised to see shock on her face.</p>
                                        <p>“The Gold Crow Tribe and Berserker Tribes have gathered all their horse carts
                                            together, with their old, women and children also gathered and hidden in the
                                            inner circle of the horse carts. The warriors from both tribes add up to
                                            around four thousand or so, surrounding the horse carts as they fight
                                            against the WanShou Empire attacks. However, it seems like their injuries
                                            and death aren’t high… surprisingly, it seems like the Wolf Cavalry Troops
                                            and Unicorn Cavalry Troops actually have higher casualties. The fighting
                                            capabilities of the Gold Crow Tribe and Berserker Tribe are indeed
                                            impressive.” She quickly described the situation.</p>
                                        <p>For Shangguan Fei’er to actually praise them so much, one could surely
                                            imagine that the Gold Crow Tribe and Berserker Tribe had truly impressed her
                                            and left a stamp in her mind. Hearing her words, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            overjoyed.</p>
                                        <p>Immediately, he seized the opportunity and called out to his Peerless
                                            Battalion brethen. “Brothers, our comrades are now being surrounded and
                                            attacked by the WanShou Empire armies. Everything else, I shall not speak,
                                            but let me just tell you that the Gold Crow Tribe and Berserker Tribe are
                                            full of countless beauties. For the sake of our beautiful female comrades,
                                            get ready your Consolidated Bows!”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Shangguan Fei’er almost vomited out a mouthful
                                            of blood. What sort of pre-battle motivational speech was that?! However, to
                                            her surprise, upon hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, all the Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers howled out excitedly, their fighting spirit raised to the max.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s grasp on human nature was learned from Mu En, and such a
                                            motivational speech was perhaps very different and… strange, and would never
                                            have worked on any ordinary army unit. However, the Peerless Battalion was
                                            just too different. These ruffian soldiers had not felt the touch of a woman
                                            in such a long time, and perhaps even a female sow would excite them, let
                                            alone hearing about female comrades! Women, such a term was perhaps far more
                                            important to them than gold.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng shouted: “Single Line Battle Array!”</p>
                                        <p>Ordinarily, Zhou Weiqing did not participate in the training of the troops,
                                            and naturally he was not the one to directly command the battle. The First
                                            Main Company was truly the finest of the Peerless Battalion elites, not just
                                            because of their strength, with each of them at least three-Jeweled Physical
                                            Jewel Masters or higher. Spurring their warhorses, the five hundred soldiers
                                            swiftly arranged into their single-lined formation.</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, the two WanShou Empire Regiments had long discovered the
                                            over five hundred cavalry troops advancing towards them. However, the
                                            WanShou Empire troops had always looked down on the ZhongTian Empire troops,
                                            and their only reaction was to send two hundred men Wolf Cavalry Companies
                                            to break off and charge towards Zhou Weiqing’s troop.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that the WanShou Empire troops that the Peerless Battalion
                                            had the most experience in fighting were exactly the Wolf Cavalry soldiers,
                                            and they were very experienced in facing them. None of them were flustered
                                            or panicked, instead feeling excitement.</p>
                                        <p>“Consolidated Bows, prepare!” Hua Feng’s voice was not loud, but all the
                                            Peerless Battalion soldiers could clearly hear it.</p>
                                        <p>Five hundred Consolidated Bows drew at the same time, and row after row of
                                            titanium tipped arrows glinted coldly in the sunlight.</p>
                                        <p>As the enemies entered the five hundred yard range, Hua Feng finally gave the
                                            order to shoot.</p>
                                        <p>Ear piercing shrill whistles resonated through the entire battlefield. The
                                            Consolidated Bows with the Overlord Bow as a base blueprint showed their
                                            power once more in the battlefield, their disquieting shrieks causing the
                                            entire battlefield to freeze momentarily.</p>
                                        <p>A series of thuds as arrows met flesh, and they could clearly see a cloud of
                                            blood rise up into the air along with explosions as the explosive effect of
                                            the Consolidated Bows came into effect.</p>
                                        <p>Five hundred men attacking at the same time, but there was no confusion or
                                            disorder. One arrow targeting the beastmen, one arrow targeting the war
                                            wolves. After just one round, the two hundred wolf cavalry soldiers charging
                                            at them were whittled down to a mere several dozen. These remaining were
                                            either extremely lucky or some of the more powerful soldiers or higher
                                            ranked officers amongst the wolf cavalry soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>“Master Hua Feng, you take care of command here. I will be charging ahead to
                                            contact the two tribes.” Zhou Weiqing quickly told Hua Feng before spurring
                                            his Single-Horned Ghost Demon Horse, charging towards the dozen remaining
                                            wolf cavalry soldiers. Just these few remaining stragglers were not worthy
                                            of the Peerless Battalion soldiers shooting another salvo.</p>
                                        <p>The shrill sounds immediately drew the attention of the two WanShou Empire
                                            Regiments, and when they saw the two Wolf Cavalry soldier Companies almost
                                            wiped out so easily, they were all absolutely shocked.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing did not charge forward alone. Shangguan Fei’er
                                            and Lin TianAo flanked him on each side respectively, charging together
                                            simultaneously.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Meanwhile, the Company Leader of the First Main Company, Lei Zi, was in a
                                            relatively good mood now. That was because, while they were shooting their
                                            arrows, he had received a message from Zhou Weiqing. As long as his
                                            performance in today’s fight was satisfactory, then Zhou Weiqing would
                                            release him from the Darkness Seal.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Three Ghost Demon Horses, forming a tiny triangular formation as they charged
                                            forward. The remaining dozen or so Wolf Cavalry Soldiers were undoubtedly
                                            the most powerful amongst the two Companies, and though they saw their
                                            comrades fall like wheat culled before their eyes, they were not afraid.
                                            Instead, they shouted their Totemic Activation Chant “Bathulu!” as they
                                            charged towards the incoming trio.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s trio did not stop, and both sides seemed to pass the other
                                            without any contact. Even with Hua Feng’s vision, he was not able to catch
                                            sight of what had happened, but moments after the two sides had crossed, the
                                            dozen Wolf Cavalry soldiers and their war wolves all fell to the ground…
                                            dead.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er was right besides Zhou Weiqing, and currently her heart was
                                            filled with surprise. She had been very close to him, and had thus been able
                                            to observe everything clearly. Just before both sides had crossed, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had said a simple line: “Let me.”</p>
                                        <p>The next moment, Shangguan Fei’er had seen many tiny, inch-long Wind Blades
                                            appear out of nowhere, right in front of every single Wolf Cavalry Soldiers
                                            and their war wolf mounts. Even though there were two three-Jeweled Company
                                            Leaders on the enemy’s side, none of them were able to react in time, and
                                            their tough fur was also unable to defend against this at all.</p>
                                        <p><i>Highly compressed Wind Blades… is this the consummate Skill that the Six
                                            Ultimate Heavenly Emperor taught him?</i> Shangguan Fei’er thought to
                                            herself. <i>Little Fatty has indeed grown much stronger… even I am not able
                                                to truly know his strength now. </i></p>
                                        <p>The WanShou Empire Regiments reacted extremely quickly. As soon as they saw
                                            their two Wolf Cavalry soldier Companies had been slaughter so easily, they
                                            realised that the incoming cavalry soldiers were not to be dismissed easily.
                                            Several cries that Zhou Weiqing could not understand sounded out, and an
                                            entire Battalion of Unicorn Cavalry soldiers wheeled around immediately and
                                            started charging towards the trio.</p>
                                        <p>Both sides were speeding towards the other at breakneck speeds, and the gap
                                            between them closed almost instantly. This was the first time Zhou Weiqing
                                            had seen the Unicorn Cavalry troops. The Unicorn Beasts could no longer be
                                            described as horses, their bodies massive and muscular, especially their
                                            shoulder areas, rippling with sleek muscles. The single horn on their heads
                                            were almost a chi long, the base as thick as an adult’s fist, the tip sharp
                                            and pointy, looking extremely deadly. From his first look, they did look
                                            rather similar to Zhou Weiqing’s single-horned Ghost Demon Horse, though
                                            they did not have the scales which it did. However, below their ribs, there
                                            were two metre-long wings.</p>
                                        <p>The Unicorn Beastmen were all about 1.9 metres tall, dressed in black heavy
                                            armour, with three metre long spears in their hands.</p>
                                        <p>As both sides were about to reach once more, all of a sudden amongst the
                                            Unicorn Cavalry, about a dozen or so of them accelerated in an abrupt burst.
                                            The next moment, the dozen or so Unicorn Cavalry troops leaped and actually
                                            ascended into the skies, their wings spread as they charged towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s trio savagely.</p>
