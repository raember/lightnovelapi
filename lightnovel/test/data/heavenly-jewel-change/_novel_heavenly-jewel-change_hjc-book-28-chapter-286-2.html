                                            that easily. Await your impending doom.”</p>
                                        <p>After he finished his words, two loud bangs were heard. No. 1 and 2 had
                                            choose to self-destruct by exploding. The extremely overwhelming destructive
                                            black flames erupted in an instant, heading towards Long Shiya. </p>
                                        <p>Because of the shock that no. 1 and 2 gave him, he had let his guard down
                                            momentarily. Otherwise, he would never have allowed them to self-destruct
                                            that easily. </p>
                                        <p>The six-colored light around Long Shiya formed an enormous vortex,
                                            obstructing the black flames with no difficulty. Just like that, no. 1 and 2
                                            vanished without a trace.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya stood there for a moment looking pensive. <em>Heavenly King
                                            skeletons? With destructive attributes. Lord Fen Tian is indeed a ruthless
                                            person</em>! Very clearly, these skeletons came from the ancestors of the
                                            Blood Red Hell. Putting aside how Fen Tian did it, just by virtue of the
                                            fact that he dug the remains of the ancestors out from the grave itself was
                                            intolerable. </p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya did not waste too much time by staying there for long, as he had
                                            no idea how many people Fen Tian sent over. Protecting his precious disciple
                                            was his utmost priority. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing, who was in mid-air, seemed to be completely unaffected by
                                            everything that was going on. He continued the process of consolidating
                                            without experiencing a single feeling from the external world. </p>
                                        <p>With more and more green patterns appearing in the sky, that also gradually
                                            brought out its magnificent colors, the jade dragon started shrinking
                                            slowly. However, judging from its size, the process of consolidating in the
                                            void had just begun. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was hovering in the air, without any facial expression on his
                                            face. His eyes looked focused and his hands were moving rhythmically,
                                            gradually increasing its speed, speeding up the consolidation process.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the three Shangguan sisters were on the ground. They were
                                            certainly affected by the destructive energy from before because it was a
                                            lot purer and more powerful than what they had encountered in the past.
                                            However, they had consolidated the Saint Core Nucleus before. Even though it
                                            was not the actual Saint Core Nucleus, the Saint Energy was not weak. After
                                            dispelling the destructive energy for a period of time, they had gradually
                                            recovered.</p>
                                        <p>The duration of consolidation was considered to be very lengthy in the eyes
                                            of the outside world. Very quickly, three days had passed. In mid-air, Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s eyes were still as focused as before; his body was also as stable
                                            as before - it looked as though he had just started consolidating.</p>
                                        <p>However, anybody with a discerning eye could tell that Zhou Weiqing’ five
                                            meter-tall body of energy looked more faded and illusion-like, as compared
                                            to how it was like at the start of the process. Clearly, this phenomenon was
                                            because of the constant consumption of his energy. However, the jade dragon
                                            had already shrunken to two thirds of what it used to be.  </p>
                                        <p>Since the consolidating process was very long, none of the powerhouses of the
                                            Peerless Sect dared to be careless. Under the mobilization of Long Shiya,
                                            they took turns to rest. At the same time, he mobilized a huge number of
                                            soldiers within the Heavenly Bow City to guard every corner of it; every
                                            single business was temporarily closed. For the sake of Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            safety, the Heavenly Bow Empire had spared no pains or effort.</p>
                                        <p>In the blink of an eye, four days had passed. It had been full seven days but
                                            Zhou Weiqing had yet to complete the consolidating process. When the jade
                                            dragon had reduced to half its size, Zhou Weiqing speed of consolidation had
                                            clearly slowed down. Even though nobody knew what his considerations were,
                                            the decrease in speed meant that the whole process would take an even longer
                                            time. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s energy body had clearly become more faded and illusion-like,
                                            to the extent that one could vaguely see his actual body within it. </p>
                                        <p>However, the only thing that did not change were Zhou Weiqing’s eyes - from
                                            the start till the end, they were as focused as ever.</p>
                                        <p>What shocked everyone was the scroll that was being consolidated in the void.
                                            After seven days worth of time, it had more or less taken shape.</p>
                                        <p>The emerald green light seemed to have formed a huge web in the sky with
                                            several strange patterns on it. Every single pattern was complicated yet
                                            magnificent.</p>
                                        <p>If it was an ordinary Consolidating Equipment Scroll, one would be able to
                                            see what it was consolidating into from the image on it. However, the one
                                            that Zhou Weiqing was currently consolidating was unidentifiable. The
                                            patterns appeared to be very consistent, but nobody could tell what kind of
                                            Consolidated Equipment it was. It could not possibly be a mere web.  </p>
                                        <p>Only Duan Tianlang was aware of the secret behind it as he was the one who
                                            designed it. Even Zhou Weiqing, who was crafting it, had no idea what the
                                            completed scroll would do for his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set.</p>
                                        <p>Duan Tianlang had been observing from down below, not missing a single
                                            detail. Even when Long Shiya personally advised him to rest, he had rejected
                                            with no hesitation - or rather, his gaze had never left Zhou Weiqing. He had
                                            completely ignored Fatty Long.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya felt very helpless - he could only carefully help Duan Tianlang
                                            maintain his physical condition using his Heavenly Energy. Fortunately, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had done a thorough job fixing Duan Tianlang’s dire physical
                                            condition earlier. Even though it greatly drained his body, the impact on
                                            his body was not as great as before. It was not life-threatening.</p>
                                        <p> “Old Duan, how long more before Weiqing finishes?” asked Long Shiya
                                            impatiently.</p>
                                        <p>Duan Tianlang looked at the sky and gently shook his head, “I have no idea
                                            either. This design is harder to complete towards the end as it gets more
                                            complicated. As it closely correlated to the start of the process, Zhou
                                            Weiqing reduced his speed. However, you don’t have to worry. If Zhou Weiqing
                                            is unable to withstand it any longer, no God Tier master in this world will
                                            be able to withstand the process of crafting this particular scroll. I have
                                            absolute confidence in him. Under the Astral Celestial Territory, a miracle
                                            is bound to happen.”</p>
                                        <p>Another seven days had passed. When 21 days were up, Zhou Weiqing’s wives got
                                            very impatient. Even the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was the
                                            same.</p>
                                        <p>In mid-air, the jade dragon had already lost its dragon form. All that was
                                            left was a ball of emerald green light. Zhou Weiqing’s appearance was the
                                            main reason why they could not maintain their cool. His original energy body
                                            had vanished; even the Astral Celestial Territory had dimmed down a lot. The
                                            starlight looked indistinct as well. From the looks of it, it was apparent
                                            that he could collapse at any moment. Under such circumstances, nobody was
                                            able to tell how much more Zhou Weiqing was able to withstand. </p>
                                        <p>Having revealed his physical body, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes were still full of
                                            vigor. However, his face looked pale. As both his hands were moving, his
                                            body would tremble slightly from time to time. It was apparent that the
                                            whole process was taking a huge toll on his body. Judging from his current
                                            speed, he still needed quite a number of days before he could complete
                                            consolidating! Hence, everyone was panicking. However, up to this point,
                                            Zhou Weiqing had already put in a lot of effort and sacrificed way too much.
                                            Nobody dared to advise him to stop.</p>
                                        <p>Days passed and in the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            body had started trembling continuously in the sky - only his hands and eyes
                                            looked steady and focused. </p>
                                        <p>In the sky directly above the Heavenly Bow City, Zhou Weiqing’s figure looked
                                            extremely tiny, while the massive emerald green light could be seen
                                            radiating all around.</p>
                                        <p>The Astral Celestial Territory had completely vanished since yesterday. The
                                            emerald green scroll that was consolidating in the void seemed like a brand
                                            new sky, reflecting a beautiful shade of emerald green above the Heavenly
                                            Bow City.</p>
                                        <p>The consolidation process had came down to its final moment. However, Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s speed had reduced to the speed of a snail inching forward.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Tian’er, Shangguan Xue’er, Fei’er, Bing’er and Little Witch
                                            were not guarding Zhou Weiqing in the sky. Instead, Long Shiya had taken
                                            over. The five women were kneeling before Duan Tianlang. Even though they
                                            did not say anything, everyone knew what they were begging for.  Even Duan
                                            Tianlang could not help but be moved. </p>
                                        <p>Duan Tianlang clenched his teeth and did not make a sound. To him, the scroll
                                            was way too important, especially since the consolidation process was in its
                                            final stage. Even though Zhou Weiqing’s movements were extremely slow, he
                                            was still advancing after all. On Zhou Weiqing’s back, both wings were
                                            spread open. At this moment, he was consuming his Life Energy. He was
                                            completely supporting himself in one breath with his mind. </p>
                                        <p>At this time, Duan Tianlang was not just thinking about himself but Zhou
                                            Weiqing as well. In the event that Zhou Weiqing failed, one could imagine
                                            the impact on him - he might never be able to make a breakthrough to the
                                            Heavenly God Stage. If he succeeded, then the door to the Heavenly God Stage
                                            would be wide open for him. Even if he was unable to make a breakthrough
                                            immediately, it was only a matter of time, which would not be long.</p>
                                        <p>As the five women could sense the draining of Zhou Weiqing’s life, they knelt
                                            down before Duan Tianlang. They were very clear that the only person within
                                            the Heavenly Bow City who could stop him was his Senior Uncle. Not even his
                                            father, Admiral Zhou, or his master, the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long
                                            Shiya, could stop him.</p>
                                        <p>The five women continued kneeling night and day, while Zhou Weiqing was on
                                            the verge of collapsing in mid-air. It was too difficult for him to complete
                                            the consolidation process alone. It was way too difficult. Indeed, Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s cultivation base was sufficient. In fact it was more than enough.
                                            However, it must not be forgotten that in a way, he was not considered a
                                            true God Tier Master! He could only complete such a task, that only God Tier
                                            Masters could perform, was because he relied on Time Reversal. When he
                                            started crafting the Consolidation Equipment Scroll, the consumption of his
                                            Saint Energy was too great, to the extent that the external world could not
                                            replenish it. The jade dragon was much more difficult to deal with than
                                            expected. Hence, even Duan Tianlang did not expect the difficulty level of
                                            this piece of Consolidation Equipment Scroll to be that high. </p>
