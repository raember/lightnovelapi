                                        <p>Let alone Lei Zi, even if it were a more powerful six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters with all Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills, it was unlikely
                                            he or she would be able to withstand that flurry of Skills.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing did not really want him to become his Follower, but
                                            was just teaching this wild and intractable fellow a painful lesson. If the
                                            lesson was not strict enough, and he kept coming to challenge him in the
                                            future, wouldn’t that be a bother? As such, he had used such a show of force
                                            to take down Lei Zi so seemingly easily, at the same time it was also a
                                            display for the other newer soldiers to awe them into submission.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Seventh Legion Command Headquarters.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing and Wei Feng reached, the headquarters was already full of
                                            the senior officers of the Seventh Legion. Those who were there were at
                                            least of the Vice Regiment Commander rank or higher, with their armour
                                            clearly depicting their status.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Wei Feng’s arrival did not rouse anyone’s attention, as they
                                            were currently listening to Shen Ji.</p>
                                        <p>However, Shen Ji glanced towards Zhou Weiqing, and his originally strict face
                                            smiled faintly for a moment, and he nodded to Zhou Weiqing before
                                            continuing.</p>
                                        <p>Although he was a little afraid of Zhou Weiqing’s background, at this moment,
                                            Shen Ji would not give him any special treatment. After all, that would
                                            easily reveal his identity and status.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing also nodded back to Shen Ji in greeting, before standing right
                                            behind the rest of the other officers.</p>
                                        <p>Due to Shen Ji’s attention, the officers in front also subconsciously turned
                                            back to look at Zhou Weiqing. For the others, it was still alright, but when
                                            Shen Bu saw Zhou Weiqing, her expression changed and she quickly turned her
                                            head away. To Zhou Weiqing’s great surprise, he saw a blush stain her face
                                            as she did so.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing blinked in surprise before turning to Wei Feng beside him and
                                            saying in a low tone: “Old Wei, that Shen Bu girl is a little… strange
                                            today? Why did she blush when she saw me?”</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng gave a low snigger and said: “Battalion Commander, for this… no
                                            matter how intelligent you are, I am sure you will never guess the
                                            reason.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily before saying: “What… could it be that she
                                            has also fallen for me? That can’t be right… even though I am extremely
                                            suave, attractive and charismatic, I will not like women of her age!”</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng almost burst out laughing, restraining himself into a smothered
                                            giggle, and he shook his head at Zhou Weiqing. Some of the officers closer
                                            to them turned to give them an angry look. In their eyes, it was already
                                            very strange that these two low ranked officers were attending this meeting,
                                            and they actually dared to chat and laugh in such a serious meeting.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not appear to see their angry glares, asking softly: “Quick
                                            tell me, what is going on?” He was also extremely curious to find out.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng grinned and said: “Heh heh, ever since they had taken such a huge
                                            disadvantage from us at the start, Shen Bu was indeed well behaved for some
                                            time. Anyway, as you know, Bro Lin is very hardworking, and he would go
                                            outside of the camp every single day to train in his martial skills. One
                                            day, he bumped into Shen Bu… due to the fact that they had both clashed
                                            before, and Shen Bu did not dare take revenge against you… when she saw Bro
                                            Lin, they ended up fighting. Naturally, the result was her being taken down
                                            by Bro Lin. She knew that Bro Lin would train there every day, and she also
                                            ended up looking for him to fight every day. Bro Lin fought with her
                                            everyday, but did not injure here. Who knew… after a period of time, it
                                            seems like their connection is a little…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyes widened in surprise, and he muttered to himself: “Well,
                                            I’d be damn, even if you had beaten me to death I could never have guessed
                                            it! That is a thing?” Due to his shock, his voice had gone a little too
                                            loud, and this time, almost all the officers turned back to glare at
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji also heard Zhou Weiqing’s voice, and his brow furrowed slightly
                                            before he said: “Battalion Commander Zhou, please come to the front…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing immediately restrained himself, hiding the surprise in his
                                            heart, before taking large strides to the front. When he passed by Shen Bu,
                                            he gave her a strange look. Well, this lady’s looks and cultivation level
                                            were not bad indeed, definitely a good match for Lin TianAo. <i>Well, this
                                                was a little unexpected! Such a stable and silent person like Bro Lin,
                                                silently finding a wife like that so easily! </i>He thought to himself.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>As he stepped to the front, Zhou Weiqing bowed slightly to Shen Ji with a
                                            greeting. “Legion Commander Shen Ji.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji also nodded back to him before turning to the other officers and
                                            saying: “Let me introduce him to everyone. This is the Battalion Commander
                                            of the Peerless Battalion. The Peerless Battalion is a unique existence in
                                            our Legion, a special forces unit, and they will be attending this year’s
                                            battle. They are fully consistent of archers. Although Battalion Commander
                                            Zhou is only at the Battalion Commander rank, his Peerless Battalion numbers
                                            over five thousand troops.</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, understanding dawned upon the officers present. No wonder a
                                            Battalion Commander ranked officer was able to attend this high level
                                            meeting; he was leading a much larger number of troops, and had the right to
                                            be here.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji continued: “Alright, back to the main topic. This year’s situation
                                            does not look good at all. Normally, every year’s WanShou Empire forces are
                                            mainly focused at the Central North region, and the pressure there is the
                                            greatest. However, this year, their forces are extremely huge, and our
                                            pressure will not be small as well. According to preliminary reports from
                                            our scouts, the northwest border already has seventeen Regiments of the
                                            WanShou Empire soldiers gathered. This is a truly unprecedented show of
                                            force. After all, the WanShou Empire only has a total of fifty eight
                                            Regiments that we know of. This time, it can be said that they are sallying
                                            forth in full strength, attacking us from all fronts. As for our Northwest
                                            Army, besides the normal Fourth, Seventh, Eighth Legions stationed here with
                                            around three hundred thousand troops, we can also link up with the Ninth and
                                            Tenth Legions who are stationed in the TianBei City. Along with some reserve
                                            forces, our total strength is slightly over six hundred thousand. Although
                                            our fighting forces number about four times that of our enemies, but as you
                                            all know, that is not sufficient. The circumstances this year does not look
                                            good at all.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Shen Ji describe the relative military strength between both sides,
                                            Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but feel shock in his heart. No wonder that every
                                            year the WanShou Empire was able to loot some from the ZhongTian Empire… The
                                            difference in strength was truly large!</p>
                                        <p>Although it would be an exaggeration to say that one Regiment of the WanShou
                                            Empire could take on a Legion of the ZhongTian Empire, after all the
                                            ZhongTian Empire also had some extremely powerful units. Even so, it would
                                            already be a stretch for the six hundred thousand troops on their side to
                                            fight against ten Regiments of the WanShou Empire, and to do so would
                                            already be extremely good. In terms of fighting directly in a clash on
                                            terrain like the vast open plains, the WanShou Empire troops were at a
                                            greater advantage, being better able to make full use of their abilities.
                                            Let alone now that there were seventeen Regiments of enemies… After a couple
                                            of fights, perhaps the Northwest Armies might not even be able to stop their
                                            advance.</p>
                                        <p>“Seventeen Regiments? Boss, could it be that the scouts are wrong? Every
                                            year, our Northwest Armies face at most six to seven Regiments, and that is
                                            about our limit as well. How could they double the numbers this year?” One
                                            of the Regiment Commanders, the yellow feather in his cap denoting his rank,
                                            seated in the front row exclaimed in surprise.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji said solemnly: “Wrong? I also wish it was wrong… Alas, the facts are
                                            now before us, and we have to deal with it. This year’s situation is
                                            extremely strange… the Central Northern armies are facing only fifteen
                                            Regiments of the WanShou Empire, about their usual amount. The Northeastern
                                            Armies, only five, also their usual amount or less. Even the Bao Po Empire
                                            and Fei Li Empire are only facing five Regiments of the WanShou armies each.
                                            On the other hand, it is us who have the face the greatest number of
                                            enemies. This time, the WanShou Empire actually sent out more than forty
                                            Legions, and more than a third of them are gathered at our side. Our
                                            headquarters have already sent word to the Central North Command to request
                                            for reinforcements, and hopefully they can spare us some forces.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu said: “Legion Commander, I’m afraid that is extremely difficult
                                            right. They are also facing great pressure… perhaps it would be better to
                                            request for reinforcements from the Northeastern Armies?”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji did not reply, but the atmosphere in the large tent had become
                                            extremely oppressive. All of them knew that the chances of gaining
                                            reinforcements was extremely low, almost impossible. After all, the WanShou
                                            Empire forces were just too strong, and even five Regiments could not be
                                            underestimated. Each of them were officers, commanders, and who would be
                                            willing to send out their troops to help others when they still had their
                                            own battles to fight? If that caused their own defenses to break, it would
                                            be a serious offense.</p>
                                        <p>After a moment of silence, Shen Ji finally said: “Now, the Northwest Command
                                            has not yet decided whether or not to retreat to the TianBei City. In any
                                            case, while we are waiting for our orders, I want everyone to start
                                            preparing for a tough fight, every bit of preparation is of utmost
                                            importance, as the WanShou Empire could attack at any time. Do not be
                                            disheartened, I still have a piece of good news to share. The Central North
                                            Armies have already agreed to send us some aid. Although the numbers are
                                            small, but they will be lending us their strongest elite team, the Special
                                            Forces Battalion. This way, no matter what, we should still be able to hold
                                            on for some time.”</p>
                                        <p>What followed next was Shen Ji arranging his subordinates and handing out
                                            tasks and assignments. Generally, preparations like digging trenches and
                                            other battle preparations. There were also other military deployments that
                                            Zhou Weiqing did not understand.</p>
                                        <p>At last, after giving out the commands, Shen Ji said: “Alright, we shall end
                                            the meeting here today. Everyone, go back and get prepared. Prepare your
                                            soldiers to be able to fight at any time.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes Sir!” The officers gave a salute in unison before heading out of the
                                            tent. Before he could leave, Zhou Weiqing was stopped by Shen Ji. “Battalion
                                            Commander Zhou, please stay for a while.”</p>
                                        <p>“Legion Commander, do you have any instructions?” Zhou Weiqing stopped and
                                            asked.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji looked at Zhou Weiqing, hesitating for a moment before asking
                                            tentatively: “Battalion Commander Zhou, may I know if your teacher is still
                                            together with your Battalion?”</p>
                                        <p>How intelligent was Zhou Weiqing; hearing that question he instantly knew
                                            what Shen Ji was trying to get at. With a faint smile on his face, he said:
                                            “I’m sorry, Legion Commander Shen Ji. As you know, my teacher is a
                                            powerhouse who cannot join such fights, or it might lead to worse
                                            ramifications. However, our Peerless Battalion is part of the Seventh Legion
                                            after all, and no matter what, we are willing to fight and carry out any
                                            requested assignments.”</p>
                                        <p>A hint of disappointment flickered in Shen Ji’s eyes as he said: “Thank you
                                            for your support, Battalion Commander Zhou. Your Peerless Battalion soldiers
                                            are all archers, and when the fight starts, I will definitely need you to
                                            support our main forces.”</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Shen Ji did not have much hopes for the Peerless Battalion.
                                            Although he had already personally witnessed some great changes in the
                                            Peerless Battalion, they were after all still a bunch of ruffians, and he
                                            dared not easily let such a troop enter the battlefield. What if any
                                            problems occurred, it could possibly affect the rest of their allies and
                                            cause their downfall. As such, he could not easily set his mind at ease
                                            towards the over five thousand ruffian soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>The person Shen Ji truly regarded highly was naturally Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            teacher. If he had not guessed wrongly, he would be a Heavenly King Stage
                                            powerhouse, perhaps even a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. With the help of
                                            such a powerhouse, it could at least threaten one of the enemy’s Regiments,
                                            greatly helping their side. In critical moments, such a person might even be
                                            the key to victory on their end. Alas, from the way things were going, it
                                            seemed like it would not be easy to make use of such a powerhouse.</p>
                                        <p><i>Support the main forces? </i>Hearing Shen Ji’s words, Zhou Weiqing also
                                            felt a little disappointed. From Shen Ji’s tone and words, it was clear that
                                            he did not plan on letting them be part of the main fight. Yet, if they did
                                            not fight, how could he accomplish his goal of training his Peerless
                                            Battalion?</p>
                                        <p>Just as the two of them were lost in thought, they were abruptly interrupted
                                            by an urgent voice coming from outside. “Sir, Reporting!”</p>
                                        <p></p>
