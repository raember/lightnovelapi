                                            massive, larger than its kin by a considerable amount. Even its Beastman
                                            rider atop him was far more muscular and well built than the others, though
                                            Zhou Weiqing and the others were currently unable to see any Power Jewels
                                            around his wrists.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing lifted his hands, the two Legendary Hammers shimmering and
                                            appearing into his grasp along with the dark gold colour of the
                                            Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura. His Single-Horned Ghost Demon
                                            Horse seemed to be provoked by the opposing mounts, and it too accelerated
                                            abruptly without prompting, causing Zhou Weiqing to break free from the
                                            triangular formation to charge right ahead.</p>
                                        <p>The Unicorn Beastman leader pointed the spear in his hand directly towards
                                            Zhou Weiqing. In the instant that it seemed the two would clash, his spear
                                            sudden moved back a half metre. From the looks of it, it was as if he wanted
                                            to avoid a direct clash with Zhou Weiqing’s warhammers.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing could clearly hear him shouting something,
                                            causing both he and his Unicorn Beast to light up in a brilliant white,
                                            before the long spear in his hands darted out like a bolt of lightning once
                                            more.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was secretly surprised in his heart. This Unicorn Beastman
                                            leader truly had his own unique talents indeed. However, though he was
                                            thinking that in his heart, that did not stop him from countering instantly,
                                            the crying-face hammer in his right hand striking upwards in a simple arc,
                                            without any Skills activated.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of a direct strength competition, Zhou Weiqing had never been afraid
                                            of anyone, even if it were a clash against someone with higher cultivation
                                            level. As the successor to the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set, once
                                            he could wear the entire set one day, he would definitely be the strongest
                                            person in the entire world, at least in pure physical terms. Even the
                                            Heavenly God Tier Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord would not be able to
                                            compare to him in just that respect alone.</p>
                                        <p>On the battlefield, sometimes just pure physical strength was more effective
                                            than martial skill, as it was faster and more direct.</p>
                                        <p>*Clang* Another loud sound of the two powerhouses clashed hard. The Unicorn
                                            Beastmaster had absolute confidence in his physical strength, but he
                                            abruptly felt the grip of his hands heat up as a massive power forcefully
                                            struck his spear aside. Next, another Hammer smashed down savagely, striking
                                            hard on his beloved Unicorn Beast mount’s head.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Legendary Hammers were one fake and one real,
                                            its greatest power was the fact that it could be swapped at will between the
                                            hammers. As long as he did not strike down with them at the same time, it
                                            was nearly impossible to tell that one was fake and one was real. Even if
                                            the enemy had prior knowledge, it would not be easy to read the truth of the
                                            matter as well.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had used his first hammer strike to smash his enemy’s spear
                                            aside, before smashing down with the second hammer, neatly switching it to
                                            its ‘real’ and weighted form before the strike actually hit. Although the
                                            Unicorn Beast’s horn was extremely tough, how could it easily take a blow
                                            from Zhou Weiqing’s powerful hammer?</p>
                                        <p>A sickening thud, and the entire Unicorn’s head along with its horn exploded
                                            like a watermelon being split apart. The Beastman rider’s hands had been
                                            injured by the previous strike, and the death of his mount and his own
                                            inertia caused him to jerk forward uncontrollably. With another swing of his
                                            hammer, Zhou Weiqing ended his life in an unbelievably easy method.</p>
                                        <p>The clash was seemingly complicated, but it all happened in a blink of an eye
                                            as the two crossed paths.</p>
                                        <p>On the other hand, Shangguan Fei’er’s fighting style was very different from
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s. As both sides met, her legs hooked onto the saddle of her
                                            mount, her entire body leaning to the front as her pair of God Tier
                                            Consolidated Claws appeared, glinting with cold light. The Unicorn
                                            Beastmaster she faced had a pretty decent combat ability, alas when compared
                                            to her, the gap was just too great. A flurry of claw afterimages, and all
                                            that could be seen was the splattering of blood.</p>
                                        <p>As for Lin TianAo, his fighting style was the simplest. A quick Rock Armour
                                            Skill, covering him and his mount along with a fresh infusion of massive
                                            Heavenly Energy. Just like that, he continued galloping headlong, forcefully
                                            smashing into his opponent. No matter the enemy rider or his Unicorn Beast,
                                            both were sent smashing to the ground, broken bones and in a twisted
                                            mess.</p>
                                        <p>The three of them, with Zhou Weiqing in the center, galloping ahead with his
                                            hammers wielded, as if he could take down ten thousand men by himself. His
                                            flanks were guarded respectively by Shangguan Fei’er and Lin TianAo, and
                                            just like a spear they drove right into the side of the Unicorn Cavalry
                                            Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>The charge of cavalry troops were extremely quick, especially for powerful
                                            Heavenly Beasts like the Unicorns, and they were also in the perfect
                                            triangular formation. Alas, their formation was quickly smashed into by Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s trio, as the three of them bore right through the entire
                                            ranks.</p>
                                        <p>The first one who had been slain by Zhou Weiqing was actually the Battalion
                                            Commander of this Unicorn Cavalry Battalion. Although the Unicorn Cavalry
                                            troops of the Unicorn Beastmen tribe were extremely powerful, their rank in
                                            the WanShou Empire was not high. The main reason was because their tribe did
                                            not have any Heavenly Jewel Masters. As such, even though their mounts and
                                            ordinary cavalry were far superior to the wolf cavalry troops, their rank in
                                            the WanShou Empire was actually not even comparable to the Wolfman Tribe,
                                            with their strongest powerhouses lacking. As Zhou Weiqing rode in, he forged
                                            a path right through with his hammers swinging, smashing along like an
                                            unstoppable demon god. Anyone struck by his hammers were either killed
                                            instantly or critically injured, with not a single Unicorn Cavalry soldier
                                            could stand a round against him. Just like that, the three of them carved a
                                            road of blood right through the Unicorn Cavalry Battalion, speeding towards
                                            the main battlefield.</p>
                                        <p>One of the most important things about a cavalry charge was momentum, and the
                                            air of unstoppability. No matter how elite the Unicorn Cavalry were, having
                                            their entire formation carved through like that, their momentum was dulled,
                                            throwing them into a mess. Right at that time, the next salvo of arrows from
                                            the Peerless Battalion First Main Company flew out, along with the shrill
                                            cries in the air.</p>
                                        <p>The Two Companies had failed earlier, but was a single Battalion sufficient
                                            this time? Furthermore, it was one which had their entire momentum deflated.
                                            Five more salvos, and the entire Battalion had been wiped out again.</p>
                                        <p>As the finest of all the Peerless Battalion elites gathered together to form
                                            this First Main Company, ever since they had been formed, this was the first
                                            time they had shown their prowess on an actual battleground. The terrifying
                                            power of the Consolidated Equipment Bows was once again proven without a
                                            doubt.</p>
                                        <p>The sudden change in the battlefield once again drew the attentions of the
                                            two WanShou Empire Regiments. After all, an entire Battalion and two
                                            Companies had been wiped out with the shrill sounds of the arrows, and
                                            besides a few stray Unicorns fleeing into all directions, not a single
                                            Beastman was left alive.</p>
                                        <p>Barthez, the Regiment leader of the Wild Wolf Regiment, was actually the
                                            younger brother of Butler, the Regiment Leader who had been so severely
                                            injured by Zhou Weiqing’s Dark Demon God Lightning previously. Of course, as
                                            compared to Butler, his cultivation level was no match, but he was just as
                                            ferocious and valiant.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he discovered that the situation was not right on the other side,
                                            he immediately thought of his brother’s Swift Wolf Regiment and the massive
                                            defeat they had suffered previously.</p>
                                        <p>When Butler had first returned to their Tribe, he had still been conscious,
                                            and he had described the loss in detail to his tribesmen. Although Barthez
                                            was a rougher and more straightforward character who did not enjoy thinking
                                            too much into things, he was certain that he had definitely met the archery
                                            Battalion that had given his brother’s Swift Wolf Regiment such a crushing
                                            defeat. After all, his brother had mentioned that the fight had occurred
                                            around this area.</p>
                                        <p>Yet, only five hundred men had appeared now, where were the other one
                                            thousand? That was the first thought in Barthez’s mind as cold sweat
                                            streamed down his back. He could remember clearly how his big brother had
                                            mentioned how the powerful charge of the Swift Wolf Regiment had been met
                                            with a forty percent loss result.</p>
                                        <p>“Campora, leave this place to our Regiment. You bring your Regiment to take
                                            care of those five hundred archers. Do not underestimate them, make use of
                                            all your abilities including your archery, do not just charge in blindly.”
                                            Barthez turned to the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment’s Leader and said.</p>
                                        <p>The two of them had been watching from the side and had not joined in the
                                            battle previously.</p>
                                        <p>“Who are those people? Such powerful bows and arrows, to be able to kill my
                                            warriors at a five hundred yard distance.” The Unicorn Cavalry Regiment
                                            Leader Campora was also both angered and shocked. After all, their entire
                                            Unicorn Beastmen Tribe only had the two Regiments of warriors, and having an
                                            entire Battalion wiped out, how could he not have a severe heartache?”</p>
                                        <p>“How would I know who they are? Hurry up, go. They might have bows and
                                            arrows, but don’t you Unicorn Cavalry soldiers also have them? Aren’t you
                                            all always calling yourselves born archers? Hurry up and get rid of them,
                                            and I will recommend extra merits and commendations for you to the higher
                                            ups.” Barthez said passively.</p>
                                        <p>Although in terms of overall strength, the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment was
                                            stronger than the Wild Wolf Regiment, in terms of personal ranking, as a
                                            seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, Barthez was much higher ranked than
                                            Campora.</p>
                                        <p>The Beastmen were all aggressive and warlike, and Campora did not have prior
                                            news about the Peerless Battalion from Butler. As such, he did not suspect
                                            anything, and howled out loudly. Instantly, all his Unicorn Cavalry troops
                                            wheeled around and gathered, charging forth towards the Peerless Battalion
                                            First Main Company, with Campora leading them.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why he was so eager to lead his troops over was also because the
                                            fighting on this side was not easy at all. The Gold Crow Tribe and Berserk
                                            Tribe were a much tougher foe than they had anticipated. Were those really
                                            humans? They seemed even more like Beastmen than the actual Beastmen! Each
                                            with unbelievable strength and toughness; they were clearly not wearing any
                                            armour, yet spear strikes on them only left marks on their skin. Especially
                                            those massive female warriors, their defensive capabilities were shocking,
                                            even the Bear Tribesmen might not be a match for them in that aspect. After
                                            both sides had clashed for so long, those who had fallen were actually a
                                            majority from the two WanShou Empire Regiments! As for the Gold Crow and
                                            Berserker Tribes, their injuries were ever increasing, but they still fought
                                            on valiantly, repelling attack after attack with seeming unending
                                            endurance.</p>
                                        <p>If they continued fighting like this, it would definitely be possible to end
                                            up killing all of these powerful humans; after all, they barely numbered
                                            four thousand fighters in total, and their equipment were simple; without
                                            any armour and some even lacking proper weaponry. Many of them were actually
                                            using some of the fallen Wolfmen cavalry or Unicorn cavalry soldiers’
                                            weapons. As their injuries increased, their blood loss would as well, and it
                                            was likely they would eventually die of exhaustion or their injuries.
                                            However, by that time, it would definitely also be a heavy cost to the two
                                            Regiments. Up until now, they had already lost almost two Battalions worth
                                            of troops, and who knew what would be the final toll to end the fight.
                                            Previously, both Barthez and Campora were still wondering since when humans
                                            had become so tough and difficult to deal with.</p>
                                        <p>Since Barthez had asked Campora to deal with the Peerless Battalion, he was
                                            more than happy to do so. At the same time, Barthez did not stay idle,
                                            charging forward with his four Battalion Commanders by his side.</p>
                                        <p>After Zhou Weiqing’s trio had pierced through the previous Battalion’s
                                            formation, they were in the heart of the battlefield. His Dual Legendary
                                            Hammers were just too terrifying, and with just physical strength alone
                                            combined with the two, everywhere he went it was just a mess of bloody meat
                                            flying about. He did not even need to infuse them with Heavenly Energy, and
                                            the only Heavenly Energy expenditure was what was needed to maintain the two
                                            Hammers, plus whatever physical fatigue in wielding them. In fact, his
                                            Immortal Deity Technique’s recovery speed was even faster than the
                                            expenditure! After all, he had already broken through twenty Death
                                            Acupuncture Points when he reached the Five-Jeweled cultivation level.</p>
                                        <p>The power of the Beastmen and their advantage against humans was only
                                            comparative to ordinary human soldiers. Against Heavenly Jewel Masters like
                                            the trio, ordinary Beastmen would only be courting their own doom, unless
                                            they used major numbers to overload them and sacrifice themselves to take
                                            down the Heavenly Jewel Masters, otherwise they would be no threat to such
                                            powerhouses. Naturally Barthez could not stand there and just watch his
                                            tribesmen get slaughtered, and he immediately rallied the several powerhouse
                                            subordinates together and charged forth.</p>
