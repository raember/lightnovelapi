                                            clear to see. The unique thing was that even after the first burst of light
                                            dissipated, it would still leave a point of light, lasting a long time, to
                                            lead a way.</p>
                                        <p>As the saying goes, watching the mountain as you run will kill horses [1.
                                            Basically, if you keep your eye on something far in the distance, it will
                                            seem closer than it really is], especially in such a dense forest, as Zhou
                                            Weiqing and Little Witch walked along while recovering their Heavenly
                                            Energy, they took more than an hour before they finally got close to the
                                            signal flare. One could imagine how huge the Lustre Spatial Realm was just
                                            from that alone.</p>
                                        <p>In the distance, Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch could sense the powerful
                                            violent fluctuations of Heavenly Energy. By this time, they did not even
                                            need the guidance of the signal flare; just the Heavenly Energy fluctuations
                                            alone would be already to lead them to their target.</p>
                                        <p>Exchanging looks, the pair did not hasten their speed, instead slowing
                                            down.</p>
                                        <p>“How has your Heavenly Energy recovered?” Zhou Weiqing asked Little Witch. In
                                            this one hour, his own Heavenly Energy had already recovered to his
                                            maximum.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch nodded, saying: “I’ve recovered between sixty and seventy
                                            percent. There should be no problems fighting.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Be careful. For the ZhongTian Battle Team members to
                                            actually use their signal flare, it has to be something really important or
                                            powerful. If not an extremely powerful Heavenly Beast, it might be the
                                            WanShou Battle Team members. We should not rush to take action, and just
                                            watch to see what is going on first.”</p>
                                        <p>“I’ll listen to you.” Little Witch said in a cute, obedient manner, causing
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s gaze to stall for a moment. In the end, it is hard for a
                                            leopard to change its spots, just like ‘somebody’s’ perverted nature.</p>
                                        <p>The pair continued along slowly and carefully. As they did so, the violent
                                            fluctuations of Heavenly Energy grew stronger, and they could hear crashing
                                            sounds ahead.</p>
                                        <p>After pressing ahead about thirty more yards, as they looked through a bunch
                                            of trees, Zhou Weiqing could not help but be shocked by the sight in front
                                            of him.</p>
                                        <p>What appeared in front of him was so far out of his expectations, yet what he
                                            had imagined had also come true!</p>
                                        <p>In that midst of that huge, dense forest, a large clearing was in front of
                                            his eyes, and there were a lot of people fighting in the clearing
                                            currently.</p>
                                        <p>There were quite a few groups of fights, but the most intense amongst them
                                            was the current ZhongTian Battle Team leader Zhan LingTian and the WanShou
                                            Battle Team leader, a white clad young man. The two clashed in midair,
                                            causing a series of loud violent explosions. Both were moving at extreme
                                            speeds, and at Zhou Weiqing’s level, he was hard pressed to even follow
                                            their movements with his eyes, being able to only see seven sets of Jewels
                                            vaguely around their wrists.</p>
                                        <p>To reach the seven-Jeweled cultivation level before the age of thirty, that
                                            was already close to the maximum possibility.</p>
                                        <p>The glare of the signal flare above was starting to diminish, and the fights
                                            had all intensified. Besides the aforementioned fight between the two
                                            leaders, there were still many other fights. Of course, the side with fewer
                                            numbers was the WanShou Battle Team, while the one with greater numbers was
                                            the ZhongTIan Battle Team and the BaoPo Battle Team members.</p>
                                        <p>The members of the WanShou Battle Team were truly powerful. Currently, all
                                            eight of their members were there. Besides the leader who was fighting with
                                            Zhan LingTian, the other members were all fighting in a one versus two
                                            situation against the ZhongTian and BaoPo Battle Team members. They each had
                                            summoned a powerful Heavenly Beast to support them, and from a single
                                            glance, they all seemed to be at least at the Low Level Zong Stage or
                                            higher. Amongst them, there was a huge, totally white ape at the Upper Level
                                            Zong Stage, drawing attention instantly with its colossal power. The person
                                            fighting with it was none other than the one who had just parted from them,
                                            Shangguan Fei’er.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Shangguan Fei’er had only released her bracers and gloved
                                            claws, and was fighting the giant ape to a standstill.</p>
                                        <p>From the looks of things, the ZhongTian Battle Team’s side held the upper
                                            hand. After all, all eight of them were there, along with six of the Passion
                                            Valley members, totalling fourteen of the top fighters of their
                                            generation.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of power, the Passion Valley member were undoubtedly slightly
                                            weaker. However, they were all husband and wife couples, and their rapport
                                            allowed their teamwork and cooperation to definitely bring their power
                                            levels to another level, as they were able to account for each other’s
                                            strengths and weaknesses, bringing their overall power to equal the other
                                            two stronger Saint Lands.</p>
                                        <p>As for the ZhongTian Battle Team members, their individual strength might be
                                            slightly weaker than the WanShou Battle Team members as well. However, in
                                            terms of Consolidated Equipment, they clearly had a lead. For outstanding
                                            young talents like themselves who had grown into powerhouses of their own
                                            right, the threat of a Heavenly Beast was much lesser. With their numbers
                                            disadvantage, the seven members of the WanShou Battle Team (excluding the
                                            leader), were on the verge of losing.</p>
                                        <p>However, this was not the most surprising thing to Zhou Weiqing, nor was it
                                            the thing that drew most of his attention. What drew his gaze instantly… was
                                            at the back of the battlefield.</p>
                                        <p>At the back of the battlefield, there was a hill, almost a small mountain. At
                                            the bottom of the hill, there was a large cave, and within that cave lay a
                                            massive presence.</p>
                                        <p>Dragon.</p>
                                        <p>It was a dragon!</p>
                                        <p>From the looks of it, it was about eighty percent similar looking to the one
                                            that Zhou Weiqing had seen in the air previously, just a little smaller.
                                            However, it was currently in terrible shape, its massive body lying there
                                            unmoving, and under it, a stream of blood pooled around it. Right in front
                                            of it lay a large, almost two metre long egg, glowing brilliantly, lighting
                                            up the dark cave.</p>
                                        <p>The egg itself was pure white in colour, but it was glowing in a red
                                            brilliance.</p>
                                        <p>The dying dragon was licking the surface of the giant egg gently.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, the reason why the ZhongTian Battle Team released its
                                            signal flare was definitely not because of the WanShou Battle Team, but
                                            because of this dragon and the dragon’s egg!</p>
                                        <p>As for how this dragon was injured, Zhou Weiqing could not guess how. After
                                            all, any dragon’s power was not something any of them, or even all of them
                                            combined, could handle. However, he was certain that this dragon in front of
                                            them no longer had any fight left in it.</p>
                                        <p>The members of the WanShou Battle Team seemed to be protecting the dragon,
                                            while the ZhongTian Battle Team and BaoPo Battle Team members seemed to be
                                            trying to get to it to steal its egg.</p>
                                        <p>A dragon could be said to be an entire treasure trove. Not just its body, its
                                            blood, its scales, bones and horns, almost every part of it was a treasured
                                            material to Heavenly Jewel Masters. Furthermore, there was an egg there,
                                            clearly laid not long ago. What was a priceless treasure in itself! No
                                            matter who, if one could hatch a dragon’s egg and own a dragon, what kind of
                                            honour and treasure would that be!? Given sufficient time to grow, that
                                            dragon could be a future Heavenly God Powerhouse.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, what Zhou Weiqing did not know was that this Lustre Spatial Realm
                                            was actually created by the dragon race. They had been on the verge of
                                            extinction, and a long time ago, they had done so in order to preserve their
                                            bloodline and ensure the survival of their race. It was only many years
                                            later that the Heaven’s Expanse Palace would discover it on the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Island.</p>
                                        <p>As for the entrance restriction of this Lustre Spatial Realm was that the age
                                            had to be lower than thirty.</p>
                                        <p>This was the restriction that the dragon race had initially set upon this
                                            Spatial Realm as a layer of protection.</p>
                                        <p>The demise and endangerment of the dragon race was largely due to the human
                                            race. Even though each dragon was extremely powerful, how could they compare
                                            in sheer numbers with humans? In front of these crafty, greedy humans, they
                                            were just like a huge treasure trove awaiting to be plundered. DragonSlayer,
                                            that used to be an honoured name, a name that signified overnight wealth and
                                            fame!</p>
                                        <p>The pride of the dragon race had resulted in them not living together, and
                                            this had given the humans an unlimited opportunity. Finally, by the time the
                                            last few surviving elder dragons had realised this, they were faced with a
                                            dying race. They had chosen the Heavenly Jewel Island as their last stand
                                            together against the humans in a final fight. In this final battle, they had
                                            slaughtered almost all the human powerhouses, but they were also driven to
                                            the verge of extinction.</p>
                                        <p>With the last of their strength, they had created the Lustre Spatial Realm on
                                            this Heavenly Jewel Island, placing several dragon eggs within, hoping that
                                            their future kin could flourish and grow in this new world. It was also
                                            because of this that the dragons hated humans so much.</p>
                                        <p>In order to prevent humans from threatening their descendants, they had
                                            placed the restriction of the age of thirty on the Lustre Spatial Realm,
                                            forever restricting any humans above the age of thirty from entering.</p>
                                        <p>In actual fact, the last surviving elder dragons who had created this Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm had not realised that in that destructive final battle, almost
                                            all of the human powerhouses of that time had been vanquished, with much of
                                            their legacy lost. There had been almost no more threat to dragons at that
                                            time.</p>
                                        <p>Many years later, when the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had discovered the secret
                                            to this Spatial Realm, that generation of Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord had
                                            also discovered the secret through other means.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain was the sacred realm of Heavenly Beasts, and the
                                            main bloodlines of the Heavenly Snow Mountain had always been partners and
                                            allies of dragonkind. The Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers and dragonkind had
                                            very close relationships, and had once ruled to world together. It was only
                                            until the humans had grown in strength that everything had changed.</p>
                                        <p>When they had found out that the dragons still existed in the Lustre Spatial
                                            Realm, the Heavenly Snow Mountain was overjoyed. Alas, by that time, they
                                            could no longer defeat the Heaven’s Expanse Palace easily.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, both sides came to a grudging agreement, and that was the real
                                            reason behind the hosting of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. The cunning
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master of that time had craftily drawn in the other
                                            Great Saint Lands into the Tournament as well, and as time passed, it grew
                                            into a Tournament that encompassed all the Empires of the world. However,
                                            the finals of the Tournament was always held in the Lustre Spatial Realm,
                                            their original target.</p>
                                        <p>Only the ZhongTian Battle Team and the WanShou Battle Team truly knew about
                                            the secret behind the Lustre Spatial Realm, behind the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament. Every Heavenly Jewel Tournament, their goal was not the final
                                            placing in the tournament, but to find the dragons within the Lustre Spatial
                                            Realm.</p>
                                        <p>The Lustre Spatial Realm could only be opened every three years, as such, no
                                            matter the Heaven’s Expanse Palace or the Heavenly Snow Mountain, they were
                                            not worried that the other side would try to sneak into the Lustre Spatial
                                            Realm between that time period.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, none of the young fighters would be of anymatch for an adult
                                            dragon, but they could still search for the remains of dead dragons, or even
                                            dragon eggs.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Jewel Tournament had been held for so many years, so many times,
                                            and between the ZhongTian Battle Team and the WanShou Battle Team, they had
                                            only found some scattered dragon bones or scales in the past. As for finding
                                            a dragon’s egg, this was truly the first time, let alone having a dying
                                            dragon without any strength left right beside the egg.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, the WanShou Battle Team’s main target in entering the Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm was actually to harass and stop the ZhongTian Battle Team, to
                                            prevent them from gaining too much from the Lustre Spatial Realm, allowing
                                            the dragons in this fair land to have a chance to grow and flourish again,
                                            in hopes that one day they would grow strong enough to leave this unique
                                            spatial realm and join forces with the Heavenly Snow Mountain again.</p>
                                        <p>As for the ZhongTian Battle Team’s target, it was naturally to gain as much
                                            as possible from these dragons.</p>
                                        <p>The first person to find the dying dragon was a WanShou Battle Team member,
                                            but not long after, a ZhongTian Battle Team member had stumbled upon them.
                                            WIthout hesitation, he had released the signal flare. After all, with the
                                            BaoPo Battle Team’s help, their combined strengths was definitely above the
                                            WanShou Battle Team.</p>
