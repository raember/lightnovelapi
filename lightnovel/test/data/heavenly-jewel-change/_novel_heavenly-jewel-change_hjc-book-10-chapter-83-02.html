                                        <p>“Who’s your long lost tribe member? I really worked extremely hard this time
                                            in my closed door cultivation!”</p>
                                        <p>Crow gave another humph, saying: “Don’t give me that, no matter how hard you
                                            work, it’s impossible to gain so much strength in such a short period of
                                            time. Your current strength is definitely beyond any ordinary human means…
                                            there must be some secret behind it!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, since you already know it’s a
                                            secret, then you shouldn’t ask anymore. Come on, let’s finish up, I want to
                                            go back and continue cultivating. Crow, you need to buck up! It will not be
                                            easy to catch back up to my strength!”</p>
                                        <p>Crow shook her fist at him, saying: “Don’t be cocky yet! Us Gold Crow Tribe
                                            members will continue growing in strength as we mature, and as our Heavenly
                                            Energy grows. Before long, I will catch back up to you!”</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Soon, the three days of rest had ended, and the next fight begun. Perhaps
                                            because of the ferocity of the Fei Li Battle Team in the previous round,
                                            their fourth round opponents barely put up a token struggle before
                                            surrendering, giving them an easy victory. Once again, only Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Crow actually fought, with each gaining a 1v1 victory, then easily beating
                                            their opponents in the 2v2 match.</p>
                                        <p>In the entire process of the fourth round fights, when the Ka’Ou Battle Team
                                            members looked at Crow and Zhou Weiqing during their fights, they
                                            immediately thought of the bloody scene of the Bai Da Battle Team and the
                                            sickening deaths. Originally, they were already weaker than the two young
                                            combatants, and with fear in their hearts, how could they possibly have a
                                            chance.</p>
                                        <p>As such, the Fei Li Team had achieved victory over all four of their matches,
                                            and the only remaining match was against the seeded team of their group, the
                                            Dan Dun Battle Team. Even if they conceded to them in the next, and final,
                                            round, they were already guaranteed a top eight spot.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Besides the quick fight of the fourth round, Zhou Weiqing continued his
                                            diligent training and cultivation. Before the fourth round and his evolving,
                                            he had already completed the thousand-tempering training of his Touch of
                                            Darkness Skill. Alas, due to the Skill lasting longer than others, and the
                                            sheer expenditure of spirit, he had been unable to complete all
                                            three-thousand tempering as planned. Still, he had already gained a marked
                                            improvement on control and in understanding the profound mysteries.</p>
                                        <p>As for three days of rest after the fourth round, Zhou Weiqing chose another
                                            of his most useful skills to go through tempering. At the same time, he also
                                            grit his teeth and went through the immense suffering of breaking through
                                            the next Death Acupuncture Point, the first of his chest Death Acupuncture
                                            Points, the ventral septum (DanZhong Acupuncture Point [1.<a
                                                    href="http://baike.baidu.com/view/375622.htm">http://baike.baidu.com/view/375622.htm</a>]).
                                            With that, he had successfully entered the Immortal Deity Technique’s third
                                            portion.</p>
                                        <p>The entire Immortal Deity Technique had four main portions, and Zhou Weiqing
                                            had already completed the first two portions, breaking through the thirteen
                                            Death Acupuncture Points depicted in them. As for the last two portions,
                                            they were of the chest area Death Acupuncture Points and the head-neck area
                                            Death Acupuncture Points respectively, totally another twenty three Death
                                            Acupuncture Points. Of the two, the third portion depicted fourteen chest
                                            area Death Acupuncture Points, the most of any portion. As such, the third
                                            portion was also one of the most important and critical parts of the entire
                                            Immortal Deity Technique.</p>
                                        <p>When breaking through the DanZhong Acupuncture Point, Zhou Weiqing realised
                                            that the pain was much lesser than previously, perhaps due to his body and
                                            physique having evolved. As such, he was better able to withstand the pain,
                                            managing to go through the process successfully without going crazy, even
                                            without Bing’er’s help this time. The entire process went through much
                                            smoother than all the previous times he had broken through Death Acupuncture
                                            Points, and in barely two hours, he had successfully broken through and
                                            entered the next stage.</p>
                                        <p>As such, Zhou Weiqing had finally reached the 14th stage of Heavenly Energy,
                                            the 2nd level of the Heavenly Shen Energy stage. Once again, he had taken a
                                            big step towards reaching his fourth Jewel.</p>
                                        <p>However, at the same time, Zhou Weiqing also realised a problem. Although his
                                            entire maximum Heavenly Energy had increased drastically with the
                                            breakthrough of the Death Acupuncture Point, but his recovery rate and
                                            training speed did not improve any further, or perhaps only a very minimal,
                                            almost unnoticeable increase. It seemed like unlike the previous portions,
                                            in order to gain the largest benefit on recovery rate, he would have to
                                            complete the entire portion, and have the Death Acupuncture Points
                                            completely broken through to form a circulatory flow.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Time flew indeed, and it seemed like a blink of an eye and it was already the
                                            final round of the preliminary heats. After this round, the top eight would
                                            get five days of rest before the quarter finals begun. Once the top four had
                                            been selected out of the quarter finals, the semi finals would be held on
                                            the Heavenly Jewel Island, and the top four would have the honour of
                                            entering it. Of course, what happened there was only known to the top four
                                            teams.</p>
                                        <p>With the tournament having proceeded to this point, the top eight were
                                            actually pretty much determined already. Naturally, the four seeded teams,
                                            all of whom had not fought a single match, were guaranteed their spots. As
                                            for the rest of the teams, two had already fought their way to the top
                                            eight. One was of course the Fei Li Battle Team from group three, but the
                                            other was the previously unheard of Kalise Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>The situation of the Kalise Battle Team was similar to the Fei Li Battle
                                            Team, with their last round fight being the seeded team of their group. In
                                            their earlier rounds, they had also achieved four victories, and without
                                            question they would also be in the top eight.</p>
                                        <p>If everything went normally, according to the tournament fixtures, being the
                                            second of their group, the Kalise Team would likely be facing the first of
                                            group three, the Fei Li Team’s group. That meant they would likely be facing
                                            the seeded team of that group, Dan Dun Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>As the final round of the preliminary heats, the most popular was naturally
                                            still the various betting booths. After all, this was the final chance for
                                            the citizens and audience to place their bets. This year’s Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament had indeed let the ZhongTian Empire earn a sizeable income from
                                            organising the bets.</p>
                                        <p>The seven members of the Fei Li Battle Team reached the ZhongTian Plaza
                                            early. As with the previous rounds, they claimed their winnings first.
                                            Naturally, they had all won a large amount from the fight with the Bai Da
                                            Empire, but their odds against the Ka’Ou Team had dropped drastically, and
                                            they had barely gotten much from that last bet.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, after all the four rounds of fighting, Zhou Weiqing’s pocket had
                                            been fattened to an impressive million gold coins. The richest was naturally
                                            still Ye Paopao, who had amassed a rather terrifying million and three
                                            hundred thousand gold coins.</p>
                                        <p>As the employee at the betting booth passed them their gold coin storage
                                            cards, he couldn’t help but feel envious, saying jokingly: “You guys sure
                                            have earned a lot this year! Are you still betting today? If you all chose
                                            to fight, it can be a chance to win big! 1 to 100 odds!”</p>
                                        <p>Of course, his words had been a joke, perhaps even a light hearted jibe.
                                            After all, the Fei Li Battle Team’s opponent today was the seeded team, the
                                            Dan Dun Battle Team. Without question, the four seeded teams would never
                                            throw a fight just to earn some gold coins; not only was it their pride and
                                            face, more importantly it was also concerning a chance to enter the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Island, which was definitely critical to all the other Great Saint
                                            Lands.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, that was also why the ZhongTian Empire dared to set such an insane
                                            odds of 1 to 100, to tempt others into placing bets should there be an
                                            actual fight. The five Great Saint Lands did not lack money, and their aim
                                            in the Tournament was to enter the Heavenly Jewel Island. For them to lose
                                            to any other team not from another Great Saint Lands, it would be a great
                                            humiliation.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing the employee’s joke, Zhou Weiqing, who had been standing right in
                                            front, suddenly slammed his gold coin storage card down. Smiling, he said:
                                            “Alright, I bet everything on ourselves, Fei Li Battle Team victory.”</p>
                                        <p>The employee started, staring at him dazedly for a moment, before he
                                            recovered himself. Laughing a little in spite of himself, he said: “Don’t
                                            joke around, keep it quickly, that is a million gold coins.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said seriously: “Who is joking? I am really betting on us to
                                            win. We are really fighting today; what you said is right. A 1 to 100 payout
                                            rate, our fate lies in our own hands, how can I not bet on myself.”</p>
                                        <p>Taken aback, the employee stuttered in shock: “You… you mean… you are really
                                            going to fight the seeded team today?” Most, if not all, teams would not
                                            want to fight the seeded teams before the top eight. After all, no one
                                            wanted to take too many losses before the quarter finals.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and nodded, saying: “Yes, we are serious. Please register
                                            us.”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao stood beside Zhou Weiqing, saying hesitantly: “Weiqing, you do not
                                            need to bet so much. Our chance isn’t that high.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, saying: “Our imagination is our limit; the
                                            more we dare, the more the land will yield. If I win, my million gold coins
                                            becomes a hundred million gold coins, haha I wonder if the ZhongTian Empire
                                            will feel a heartache if that really happens! Are you all betting?”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao shook his head, saying: “I’ve already earned enough this time, and
                                            I shall not want to lose it all… A man content with his lot is a happy man.
                                            I will join you in betting ten thousand gold coins just for fun
                                            instead.”</p>
                                        <p>The rest of the others placed a similar bet to Ye Paopao, each placing ten
                                            thousand on themselves. The only exception was Crow. She was the poorest of
                                            the entire team, and even after winning the last four rounds, she had only
                                            amassed thirty thousand gold coins. Unhesitatingly, she bet all of it on
                                            their team.</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao laughed and said: “Sis Crow, why did you follow Weiqing and go
                                            crazy? It’s tough for us to earn money, not like that fellow who is a
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master!”</p>
                                        <p>Crow shook her head, grinning as she said: “I trust in Weiqing, and also my
                                            own vision. If we do not put our backs against the wall, to break the
                                            caldrons and sink the boats[2. Another literal translation of a Chinese
                                            idiom meaning to put one’s back against the wall to steel their resolve and
                                            ensure victory. Basically, it’s the tale of the famous general Xiang Yu, who
                                            led his troops to invade a city. After crossing a river, he ordered his
                                            troops to destroy their food cauldrons and burn their boats, showing his
                                            resolve. With only three days rations, they launched their attack and
                                            succeeded], how can we win? We must win!”</p>
                                        <p>The employee of the betting booth stared at all the team members like they
                                            had gone crazy, or become idiots. Even after he had finished their
                                            registration and they had left, he was still in a daze of disbelief.
                                            However, he had already accepted the bets, that was indeed true.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, for this last round of the preliminary heats, the Fei Li Battle Team
                                            had steeled their resolve and made up their minds to fight the Dan Dun
                                            Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>This was also the words that Zhou Weiqing had used to rouse his teammates,
                                            when he had been explaining his plan before the fight with the Bai Da Battle
                                            Team.</p>
                                        <p>At that time, Zhou Weiqing had told his team that his target was not the Bai
                                            Da Battle Team, but the Dan Dun Battle Team! He had a few reasons, simple
                                            but compelling. First of all, everyone was used to not fighting the seeded
                                            teams in the preliminary heats. As such, the Dan Dun Battle Team definitely
                                            would not place much importance on them, instead looking to the other groups
                                            and analysing their possible opponents there. Of course, their main focus
                                            would still be on the other three seeded teams.</p>
                                        <p>Under such a circumstance, the Dan Dun Battle Team would not be expecting
                                            themselves to be challenged by the Fei Li Battle Team, and they might grow
                                            careless. As such, by challenging and fighting them now, it would be easier
                                            than any other seeded team who already knew they were fighting them. After
                                            all, the Fei Li Battle Team had already secured their top eight spot, and
                                            did not have anything to lose by fighting them here.</p>
                                        <p>More importantly, amongst the five Great Saint Lands, besides the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect, the Blood Red Hell was the next weakest. Instead of possibly
                                            facing the two strongest teams in the WanShou Battle Team and the ZhongTian
                                            Battle Team where their chances were much lower, they might as well pit
                                            themselves against the Dan Dun Battle Team now!</p>
