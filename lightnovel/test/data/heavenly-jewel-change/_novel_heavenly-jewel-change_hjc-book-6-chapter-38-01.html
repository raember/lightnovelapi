                                            even if he were seen by women, would this little rascal mind? Who knows if
                                            he would come up with something like charging to be seen!?</p>
                                        <p>Filling up a large tub with water, he held little Fat Cat and jumped right
                                            into it. Poor little Fat Cat had no choice but to dog paddle to stay afloat,
                                            mewing in anger.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a hearty laugh, washing the blood and grime off its matted
                                            fur before saying softly: “Fat Cat, no matter what, you are a female… Does
                                            this count as a Yuanyang Bath [1. Basically, mixed bath. Usually denotes a
                                            loving couple or more… ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) stuff]? Heh heh heh heh.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, Fat Cat had the urge to hit its head on the wall, as it
                                            struggled hard with its paws flailing around cutely, Zhou Weiqing could only
                                            laugh and finish giving it a clean bath before putting it outside, before
                                            starting to scrub himself clean.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s nerves were indeed made very different from normal. Despite
                                            experiencing the horrifying pain from the previous night, now that he had
                                            taken a good bath and was feeling comfortable all over, he almost dismissed
                                            the pain from yesterday, truly a character that forgot the pain as soon as
                                            the scars healed. In truth, it was such a character that allowed him to
                                            continue with the Immortal Deity Technique without going insane.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, the creator of the Immortal Deity Technique had been a powerful
                                            genius who had an unimaginable talent and many fortuitous encounters, before
                                            finally dying to the Immortal Deity Technique that he had created. It wasn’t
                                            that his body wasn’t able to take it, rather his spirit not being able to
                                            take the ever-increasing pain and his consciousness collapsing from it. In
                                            the end, he had perished while breaking through the Qi Hai Death Acupuncture
                                            Point, which was a marked increase in agony and suffering.</p>
                                        <p>After washing and changing to a fresh set of clothes, Zhou Weiqing found a
                                            huge stack of food and had his fill. Satiated, he sat back, feeling full of
                                            spirit and energy, as if the months of exhaustion had been wiped away.</p>
                                        <p>“Little Wei, come here a while.” After he had finished eating, Huyan Aobo’s
                                            voice sounded out.</p>
                                        <p>Huyan Aobo and Feng Yu had both spent a sleepless night, and they had
                                            actually been alerted as soon as he had gotten up. However, they did not
                                            disturb him up till now, and seeing his lively self brimming with vigour,
                                            they were speechless. They could not envision how someone who had been in
                                            such a serious state of qigong deviation and been in such agony the previous
                                            day, could actually recover so quickly and look as if nothing had
                                            happened.</p>
                                        <p>“Teacher, I finished the final scroll last night!” Zhou Weiqing ran to Huyan
                                            Aobo’s room excitedly, though he did not mention anything about the pain and
                                            suffering he had gone through from the Immortal Deity Technique last
                                            night.</p>
                                        <p>Huyan Aobo and Feng Yu looked at the little white tiger sleeping in Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s arms with some trepidation. They did not want to talk about
                                            yesterday as well, and since Zhou Weiqing did not mention it, they were
                                            happy to oblige.</p>
                                        <p>Huyan Aobo smiled and said: “Very good, very good. In just a few short
                                            months, you have completed the most difficult stage of our sect of
                                            Consolidating Equipment Masters. Well, it is almost time for you to head to
                                            Fei Li City, you should pack up and leave as soon as possible.”</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing Huyan Aobo’s words, the excited look on Zhou Weiqing diminished.
                                            Placing Fat Cat gently on the ground, he knelt down suddenly in front of
                                            Huyan Aobo and Feng Yu, and gave them 3 kowtows.</p>
                                        <p>Huyan Aobo did not stop him, currently, his eyes were filled with pride and
                                            joy. To any teacher, the greatest feeling was to have such an accomplished
                                            disciple, and it was definitely the feeling he had right now.</p>
                                        <p>After kowtowing, Zhou Weiqing stood up once again. He did not have his usual
                                            jovial smile on his face, instead saying seriously: “Teacher, do not worry.
                                            I will definitely accomplish your dream!”</p>
                                        <p>Huyan Aobo felt his eyes misting over, and he took a deep breath, trying his
                                            best to suppress his tears. Laughingly, he scolded: “Get lost quickly! Pack
                                            up the remaining Consolidating Paper and Consolidating Ink as well, and make
                                            sure you get some practice. Just leave the completed Scrolls. I, Your
                                            Father, will be retiring after this. After working hard for so many years,
                                            once I finish selling all the scrolls you made this time, I will travel the
                                            world with Old Feng, perhaps one day we will meet again.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Who knows, perhaps by then I will already be
                                            a Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Master! Goodbye teacher, goodbye Senior
                                            Feng Yu!” After saying that, he turned to leave quickly. However, Huyan Aobo
                                            and Feng Yu could clearly see that after he turned around, his shoulders
                                            started to shake slightly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly rushed back to his room, and after closing his door, he
                                            wiped at his eyes vigorously. “Why did the sand get into my eyes…” he
                                            muttered.</p>
                                        <p>Although he normally acted like he didn't care about others and had learned
                                            how to be a scoundrel from Mu En, that did not stop Zhou Weiqing from
                                            knowing who treated him well, or stop him from having true feelings.</p>
                                        <p>Although he had only spent a mere 5 months learning and living together with
                                            Huyan Aobo, Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel how much his teacher had done
                                            and cared for him. No matter the socketing scroll, or the way he had spent
                                            all his savings to get him materials, or the way he had patiently taught
                                            him, it could be said that Huyan Aobo had done everything a teacher needed
                                            to do and much more beyond. If not for Huyan Aobo’s detailed teachings and
                                            unrestrained support in materials, he could not possibly have become a
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master in such a short time, no matter his talent.
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s code had always been - If someone treats him well, he will
                                            treat them a hundred times better. If someone treats him badly, he will take
                                            revenge a hundred times worse!</p>
                                        <p>At the other side, Huyan Aobo’s body also shook a little after Zhou Weiqing
                                            left, and he took in a deep breath and muttered to himself: “He is
                                            definitely the greatest pride of my life, bar none.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing left, and this time he did not bid farewell to Huyan Aobo and
                                            Feng Yu. He was just too afraid of the moment of farewell. However, after he
                                            left the courtyard, he knelt down at the door and kowtowed three more times,
                                            before hugging Fat Cat in his arms and leaving.</p>
                                        <p>After a while, the door opened, and both Huyan Aobo and Feng Yu appeared
                                            outside, watching Zhou Weiqing’s disappearing figure. After he had vanished
                                            into the distance, Huyan Aobo heaved a great sigh, the look on his face
                                            showing how much he did not bear to part with his beloved disciple.</p>
                                        <p>“Why didn’t you ask him to stay? If you did, he probably would have stayed.”
                                            Feng Yu said.</p>
                                        <p>Huyan Aobo shook his head, saying: “I cannot be that selfish. Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master is definitely just a side profession for him. How many
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters do the Heavenly Bow Empire have? Furthermore, with
                                            such a talent and his attributes, he will go very far as a Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master.”</p>
                                        <p>Feng Yu smiled and said: “Huyan Old Man, it’s only now that I realise you
                                            also have a cute side to your nature. Are we really going to travel the
                                            world like you said?”</p>
                                        <p>Huyan Aobo laughed heartily, saying: “Why not? I have already reached the
                                            pinnacle of my possibility as a Consolidating Equipment Master and have not
                                            much room to grow any further. Now that I have such an outstanding disciple,
                                            what more do I have to work hard towards? It’s time for me to enjoy life, to
                                            travel the world and experience life! Let’s go, we can pack up and leave
                                            soon.”</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Fei Li City was situated at the north of the Fei Li Empire, and was about two
                                            times the distance from Flying Hill City as the Flying Hill City was from
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire. After exiting the Flying Hill City, Zhou Weiqing did
                                            some estimations and realised that he was indeed on a tight schedule to get
                                            to Fei Li City in time to meet up with Shangguan Bing’er as planned. He had
                                            no choice but to travel through day and night.</p>
                                        <p>As such, he instantly released his Heavenly Jewels, quickly moving the
                                            attribute wheel to the green area, and like a bolt of lightning, he shot off
                                            towards the Fei Li City.</p>
                                        <p>Following the map, he found it was a pretty straightforward path. Running at
                                            full speed, he also found that this was very beneficial to him. Having just
                                            reached the 3rd Jewel, Zhou Weiqing was still not familiar with his new
                                            abilities and physique. As such, now that he used his Wind Attribute
                                            Heavenly Energy to run, he was surprised to find that the rise in power was
                                            not a simple matter of just figures.</p>
                                        <p>Every time his feet touched the ground, even when he wasn’t using the power
                                            of the Demonic Right Leg, he could feel as if he was light as a sparrow. The
                                            greatest surprise was a pleasant one - he found that the control of his
                                            speed was much finer than previously, being able to manipulate the Wind
                                            Attribute Heavenly Energy with a heretofore unheard of precision. This was
                                            likely the result of his continuous usage of Heavenly Energy during the 4
                                            months of creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, and the precision it
                                            required, and the strengthening of his consciousness as well.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, with the breaking through of the Qi Hai Acupuncture Point, it
                                            was quite different from the previous 11 Death Acupuncture Points. Although
                                            he had suffered a lot more, the benefits he had received were equally great.
                                            Previously, the energy whirlpools of the various Death Acupuncture Points
                                            were rather isolated, and there wasn’t much connection between all of them.
                                            However, with the Qi Hai Acupuncture broken through, it was very different.
                                            The energy whirlpool in the Qi Hai Acupuncture Point was like the central
                                            hub of his body where all the Heavenly Energy gathered and was transferred
                                            out once more. The other 11 energy whirlpools were now linked to it and with
                                            each breath he took, the Qi Hai Energy Whirlpool would spin and they would
                                            all draw in increasing amounts of Heavenly Energy from the atmosphere, and
                                            his Immortal Deity Shield was obviously stronger than before.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy was starting to evolve from
                                            the Heavenly Jing Energy to the Heavenly Shen Energy Stage. Although he had
                                            not reached the first level yet, his Heavenly Energy was already able to
                                            exhibit some of the unique qualities of Heavenly Shen Stage - to release it
                                            outside the body.</p>
                                        <p>Focusing his will, even without releasing his Heavenly Jewels, he was able to
                                            warp his Heavenly Energy into a white light out of his body, for either
                                            offense or defence, and this was definitely a big difference from previously
                                            when it was confined in his own body. Furthermore, with the Heavenly Energy
                                            in liquid state, the amount used for Skills was also reduced by a fair bit.
                                            It could be said that this 3rd Set of Jewels was a huge jump in power levels
                                            for all Heavenly Jewel Masters, in not just quantity but also quality; and
                                            it was even more so for someone like Zhou Weiqing whose innate talent was so
                                            high.</p>
                                        <p>The only thing he was lacking now was to finish Skill Storing and
                                            Consolidating Equipment. After all, for Consolidated Equipment, he only had
                                            a single one currently - the Overlord Bow on his first Physical Jewel.
                                            However, since he had spent all his time creating Consolidating Equipment
                                            Scrolls, he had not been able to Consolidate the gift from Huyan Aobo - the
                                            first piece of the Legendary Set passed down from the ancestors, and he
                                            would only do so after reaching Fei Li City.</p>
