                                        <p>“Leader, we have a long road ahead of us. Thank you for your trust. You are
                                            not just my Follower, but my big brother. I do not need you to witness me
                                            creating any miracles, instead I hope that you will join me in creating the
                                            miracle together. I trust that together, we will be able to do it!”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing also gave Lin TianAo a big hug.</p>
                                        <p>The final Champion position could be said to be the thing that dissolved the
                                            last remaining barrier between Lin TianAo and Zhou Weiqing from their
                                            previous bet.</p>
                                        <p>In Lin TianAo’s heart, it was Zhou Weiqing who had finally let him accomplish
                                            the greatest dream he had. At the same time, the last few months had built
                                            up a huge respect for this young man, not just in terms of his amazing
                                            talent in the Heavenly Jewel Master field, but his character, wit, power and
                                            intelligence. From what Zhou Weiqing had displayed, Lin TianAo even had a
                                            feeling like he had to look up to this younger man.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing was currently only at a mere three-Jeweled cultivation
                                            level, in truth his overall strength was at least comparable to any ordinary
                                            five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, or perhaps even greater. With his
                                            Immortal Deity Technique and the Devour Technique, his sustainability in
                                            combat was extremely strong. Adding to that his multiple powerful, highly
                                            rated Skills, especially ones like the Dragon Silencing Seal which were
                                            supreme Skills rated about the same as the Twelve Star Heavenly God Stage
                                            Skills, he could possibly even challenge six-Jeweled, or perhaps even
                                            seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters. Even if he were to face Zhan LingTian
                                            at full power, he might still be able to hold his own, at least for some
                                            time. After all, that Dragon Silencing Seal alone was just too overbearingly
                                            powerful.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, that was not to say that the Dragon Silencing Seal was invincible.
                                            If Zhan LingTian had been careful enough when facing Zhou Weiqing, just
                                            going full on defense mode after he had been Sealed, he could have lasted
                                            for the maximum ninety seconds of his daily three Dragon Silencing Seals’
                                            effects. Once that happened, Zhou Weiqing would not have a chance against
                                            him once more. Alas, perhaps caught by surprise, or just being too arrogant
                                            or lost in the moment, that had not happened.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, hindsight was always twenty twenty, but there was no such thing as
                                            ‘Regret Medicine’. At least in this Heavenly Jewel Tournament, Zhan LingTian
                                            had taken a huge loss.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, when Lin TianAo first met Zhou Weiqing, his power levels were
                                            rather weak in his eyes. Even though at that time Zhou Weiqing was already
                                            at the three-Jeweled cultivation level, Lin TianAo had been highly confident
                                            of beating him.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that Lin TianAo had witnessed Zhou Weiqing’s growth.
                                            Although he was still at the three-Jeweled cultivation level, but in terms
                                            of real combat ability, he had grown far beyond his original power. Lin
                                            TianAo knew that if he were to fight with Zhou Weiqing now and they both
                                            went all out, he would not have a chance. Just the Dragon Silencing Seal
                                            alone would destroy his greatest advantage, his Five Jeweled Assembly Set
                                            Shield; not to mention all the other powerful skills that Zhou Weiqing had
                                            and their combinations.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo truly believed that as time passed and Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation
                                            level was raised, he would definitely become a supreme powerhouse that could
                                            rival any from the Five Great Saint Lands.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stretched lazily, feeling his entire body comfortable and filled
                                            with strength. After finally having a great rest at night, all the fatigue,
                                            stress and exhausted spirit due to the entire Heavenly Jewel Tournament had
                                            finally been wiped out, leaving him in tip top condition.</p>
                                        <p>“Leader, did the Heaven’s Expanse Palace mention when we can get our
                                            Tournament rewards?”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo smiled bitterly: “No, they haven’t mentioned anything yet.
                                            Yesterday, when we came back, none of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace members
                                            came about. This is the Heavenly Jewel Island, and we did ruin their
                                            efforts. I think let alone getting our rewards, if we can live to get out of
                                            the island, it will already be a good result. No matter what, we still have
                                            the honour and pride of winning the Championship of the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament. That is something that we will always have.”</p>
                                        <p>A light flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes. If the Heaven’s Expanse Palace truly
                                            wanted to take revenge on them, even if they did not kill the team and just
                                            chased them out, it would still be a huge loss to them all, especially to
                                            Zhou Weiqing. Besides the rewards, just the trade he had with the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace was immense. After all, it was three God Tier Consolidated
                                            Equipment… and all part of his Legendary Set!</p>
                                        <p>Still, Zhou Weiqing did not regret anything. After all, a man had to own his
                                            actions, and there were some thing that just could not be measured just by
                                            benefits alone. In one’s youth, one had to have a few impulsive or rash
                                            moments, no matter if it were seemingly senseless, or even harmful to
                                            oneself… at least he had made his decision, taken action with resolution. If
                                            one had to live with pure reason the whole life, what colour would there be
                                            in life?</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing also believed that even if the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace cancelled their trade, they would still give out the
                                            Tournament Rewards. After all, it was their own promise, and the entire
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament was known to the entire mainland. As the top of
                                            the Great Saint Lands, if they did not have that basic integrity, how could
                                            they live up to their reputation as a Great Saint Land. Furthermore, the
                                            most important thing was, what had been done was already done, and there was
                                            no way of reversing things. Even if the Heaven’s Expanse Palace wanted to
                                            take revenge on him or the Fei Li Battle Team, it would not give them back
                                            their losses. Under such a circumstance, what would they gain from taking
                                            revenge on them? As such, Zhou Weiqing was still more confident in the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace than Lin TianAo.</p>
                                        <p>“Leader, do not worry, it should be fine. What has happened has happened,
                                            even if they kill us now, they will no longer be able to get that dragon. In
                                            such a case, what is the point? Furthermore, the fact is that I was the
                                            biggest factor for their loss, so they shouldn’t take it out on the rest of
                                            team, and hopefully considering mine and Bing’er’s relationship, I should be
                                            safe as well.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo nodded, saying: “I hope that is truly so.”</p>
                                        <p>Just at that moment, Little Four’s voice traveled from outside the door:
                                            “Boss, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace staff are here.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo’s expression changed, looking at Zhou Weiqing with a serious look.
                                            Zhou Weiqing nodded back, and they left the room together.</p>
                                        <p>As the pair headed out, they met with the staff representing the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace. This time, there were two of them, both middle aged men of
                                            about forty years of age. The rest of the Fei Li Battle Team also streamed
                                            out of their rooms; Lin TianAo’s worry was also the same as theirs. That was
                                            also the reason why they had not been celebrating like crazy even after
                                            becoming the champion.</p>
                                        <p>“Who is the leader of the Fei Li Battle Team? Please follow me to collect
                                            your rewards from the Heavenly Jewel Tournament.” The white clad man on the
                                            left said.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo said: “Hi, I am the leader of the Fei Li Battle Team, Lin
                                            TianAo.”</p>
                                        <p>The white clad man nodded and said: “Alright, follow me then. Before that,
                                            please collect all the Lustre Gems and Spatial Rings that were given out to
                                            your team previously.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo did as instructed, swiftly collecting the Lustre Gems and Spatial
                                            Rings. Alas, as the time they had spent in the Lustre Spatial Realm was just
                                            too short, none of them had actually managed to collect anything from
                                            within.</p>
                                        <p>As for the other white clad staff, he said: “Who is Zhou Weiqing, please
                                            follow me, our Palace Master wishes to see you.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, the other members of the Fei Li Battle Team grew nervous,
                                            subconsciously gathering behind Zhou Weiqing and Lin TianAo. In that moment,
                                            everyone’s hearts were palpitating quickly. In their minds, they were
                                            thinking that was it a trap that only Lin TianAo and Zhou Weiqing were
                                            called?</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Everyone, do not worry, Leader and I
                                            will be back soon.”</p>
                                        <p>A faint smile appeared on Lin TianAo’s face as well. After a short moment, he
                                            had also realised that what Zhou Weiqing said was right - it seemed like the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace had decided not to take any revenge on them, at
                                            least nothing directly. Since they had already sent someone to summon them,
                                            it meant they were not going to deal with them. Otherwise, this was the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island after all, if the Heaven’s Expanse Palace truly wanted
                                            to deal with them, it would be an easy task, and there was no need for any
                                            tricks or shenanigans.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the smiles on their faces, the remaining members, who had been so
                                            concerned that they had lost their cool, were relieved.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Lin TianAo each followed one of the white clad staff members
                                            out of the inn.</p>
                                        <p>Both sides did not take the same route. The Heavenly Jewel Tournament was
                                            over, and the four teams would be awarded with their respective rewards
                                            today. After that, besides the ZhongTian Battle Team, the rest would likely
                                            leave the Heavenly Jewel Island. Of course, they could still stay around if
                                            they wanted, but the cost of living here was not something that most people
                                            could sustain. Previously, the team, and especially Zhou Weiqing, had won
                                            quite a large sum of gold from their bets. However, as soon as they entered
                                            the Heavenly Jewel Island’s Consolidating Equipment Pavilion and Skill
                                            Storing Palace, they understood that bit of gold they had was merely a drop
                                            of water in the sea. That was not even considering the sheer prices of just
                                            food and lodging in the Heavenly Jewel Island.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing followed his white clad guide, and soon they arrived back at the
                                            mist where they had previously entered the Lustre Spatial Realm.</p>
                                        <p>“Please hold this, and infuse your Heavenly Energy within.” The white clad
                                            guide turned around and handed Zhou Weiqing a gold-red gemstone.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing received the gemstone, he examined it. The gemstone was
                                            larger than the Lustre Gem they had been given in the Tournament, and as he
                                            infused his Heavenly Energy within, a bright golden red light shot forth
                                            from the stone. The swirling white mist around them instantly turned the
                                            same golden red hue, gathering towards his body.</p>
                                        <p>The white clad guide also did the same with another gem, and the same thing
                                            happened as well. Zhou Weiqing had always been a fast thinker, and instantly
                                            inspiration struck him as he suddenly understood what was up with the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace. The current gemstone in his hands was somewhat
                                            similar in nature to the Lustre Gem, and it was likely that their effects
                                            were similar as well. Furthermore, he could sense the thick Spatial Energy
                                            around him swirling about as well.</p>
                                        <p>As such, Zhou Weiqing immediately guessed that this white mist was possibly
                                            just the Heaven’s Expanse Palace cover. The real Heaven’s Expanse Palace was
                                            possibly in another separate Spatial Realm, something like the Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm. They truly deserved their name as one of the Great Saint
                                            Lands.</p>
                                        <p>The golden red light persisted for almost ten seconds, before the two of them
                                            vanished in a bright flash.</p>
                                        <p>In the next instant, Zhou Weiqing appeared in another area.</p>
                                        <p>The moment the golden red light dissipated from around him, Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            heart was filled with shock. In front of his eyes lay a whole new world,
                                            filled with a light blue hue.</p>
                                        <p>Right above in the light blue skies, the sun was a strange orange red, though
                                            its light was not eye piercing. The entire ground seemed to be paved with
                                            some sort of jade, but it did not reflect light, seeming to have its own
                                            dull glow of its own. On that light blue surface, all sorts of rare and
                                            precious plants grew. However, all of that majestic beauty was eclipsed by a
                                            massive Palace right in front of him, shining brightly in a sky-blue
                                            colour.</p>
                                        <p>In front of the Palace was a large patch of grass, and behind the Palace was
                                            actually a massive three hundred metre tall waterfall, pouring down as if
                                            from the skies, bringing the damp sensation to their faces. However, the
                                            surprising thing was that there was actually no sound.</p>
                                        <p>This was like a saint’s paradise on earth, and at the moment, everything just
                                            seemed so surreal, almost unreal.</p>
                                        <p>The white clad guide gave Zhou Weiqing an inviting gesture, along with a
                                            respectful expression, and they both headed towards the Palace.</p>
                                        <p></p>
