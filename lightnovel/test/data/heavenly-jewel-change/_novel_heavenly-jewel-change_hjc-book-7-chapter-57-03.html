                                        <p>Could that youth’s spiritual energy be even greater than mine? Yun Li was
                                            truly shocked. He was extremely confident in his own spiritual energy; after
                                            all, even though he hadn’t reached the level of Grandmaster yet, he was not
                                            far from it. His sixteen years in the Consolidating Equipment Master world
                                            was not for nothing.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, how could he know that Zhou Weiqing was being supported by Fat Cat’s
                                            spiritual energy to be able to last so long. However, after Yun Li had
                                            watched him for a while, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt the ice cold feeling in
                                            his mind disappear, and he was shocked out of his reverie.</p>
                                        <p>“En?” Only the did Zhou Weiqing look around at his surroundings blurrily, as
                                            if suddenly recalling where he was, and what he was doing.</p>
                                        <p>“Bro Zhou, how is it?” Yun Li saw that he had awoken, and quickly asked
                                            urgently.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s expression was full of admiration, and he gave a big thumbs up
                                            as he said: “A peerless piece of work, a peerless piece of work! If I am not
                                            wrong, this should be the first of a Legendary Set, meant for Agility type
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters.” Indeed, Yun Li’s design was the first of a
                                            Legendary Set, which was suited for Heavenly Jewel Masters with the Agility
                                            Type Physical Jewel, like Yun Li or Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li nodded and said: “Bro Zhou indeed has good judgement. Your design is
                                            also another peerless work! It is also the first of a Legendary Set right!
                                            Looks like this is truly a draw indeed. Amongst Consolidating Equipment
                                            Masters, I dare to say that those who have Legendary Set designs number less
                                            than ten! I really did not expect that we would meet like this, no wonder
                                            Bro Zhou had so much confidence to bet with me.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Indeed, indeed! My luck sure is bad.
                                            However, although our designs are both the first of Legendary Sets, there
                                            still remains to see which Legendary Set is of higher quality.”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li started, saying: “How do we compare that though? Unless we can
                                            Consolidate all of them, otherwise there is no real way of comparison. After
                                            all, they are of different attributes, and I can argue that I have the
                                            advantage of speed, while yours can be argued to have the advantage of
                                            strength.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “That’s not what I mean. There is one
                                            more point that Bro Yun Li has forgotten, and that is the quantity. Another
                                            way to determine the quality of a set is naturally the quantity of it as
                                            well. When a Set is made out of more Scrolls, its power is naturally
                                            stronger. Am I right?”</p>
                                        <p>Fear suddenly gripped Yun Li’s heart, as he said: “You are right, that is
                                            indeed true. However, the God Tier Legendary Sets are all 9 pieces… could it
                                            be that yours is… different?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh… I’m sorry about this.” As he said
                                            that, he waved his hands around his Spatial Necklace and took out his entire
                                            set design, placing it on the table in front of the sofa.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li swept his gaze on them, and he froze in shock. “Te...Ten… Ten
                                            pieces?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s face was filled with pride as he said: “In the past, when my
                                            Founder Teacher designed this Set, he did not even manage to attempt
                                            creating it as he passed away due to over-expenditure of spirit during the
                                            creation. He was a respected God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, and
                                            this set of 10 pieces can be said to be one of a kind. It is extremely
                                            difficult to create, but at the same time, it should be at the peak of
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scroll Sets! As such, just comparing quality of
                                            designs alone, I’m afraid that the win is mine.”</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing saw that the design that Yun Li had brought out was also a
                                            God Tier Legendary Set, he had been stunned for a moment. However, he had
                                            calmed down quickly. After all, even if this was a draw, he still would not
                                            lose to Yun Li in the end, as the worst case scenario for him was a final
                                            draw. After calming down, he finally thought of what Huyan Aobo had told him
                                            in the past - that although his Legendary Set had not been created before,
                                            it was one of a kind! It had even expended the spirit and life blood of a
                                            God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master to design, and prior to this, a set
                                            of ten was hitherto unheard of.</p>
                                        <p>A Legendary Set referred to a set designed by a God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master with at least eight pieces to it. Usually, they were made
                                            out of nine pieces. Do not underestimate the difference that just one piece
                                            could make. It was just the addition of that one extra piece that caused the
                                            Founder of Zhou Weiqing’s teaching sect to expend all of his energy and
                                            spirit, even so much so to his death, from that one could see how difficult
                                            it had been to create this set.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Yun Li’s expression turned ugly, a dark, uneasy
                                            look appearing in his eyes. At this moment, their competition was over.
                                            However, for a person like him, who also had a God Tier Founder Teacher, how
                                            could he be willing to just become Zhou Weiqing’s Follower just like that?
                                            That would be a disgrace and humiliation that he would never be able to wash
                                            clean, furthermore there would never be any escape from it. Lifetime
                                            Follower, that meant being Sealed for his entire life as well. Upon thinking
                                            about it, his heart hurt, as if it were being gnawed upon by thousands of
                                            snakes. Slowly, his face grew fierce, even savage, as he gripped his fists
                                            tightly. Staring at the ten designs on the table, he warred internally
                                            within his own mind.</p>
                                        <p><i>Kill him, kill him!</i> A voice kept yelling in Yun Li’s mind. As long as
                                            he killed off this Zhou Weiqing in front of him, not only would he escape
                                            the terms of the bet, he would also gain this unbelievable Legendary Set
                                            design, a one of a kind, ten piece set! At the most, he would have to move
                                            out of the Fei Li Empire forever, never to return; with his skills and
                                            talent, wouldn’t it be easy to find another place to accept him?</p>
                                        <p>As the darkness in his heart erupted forth, savagely clashing against the
                                            morals and ethics in Yun Li’s heart. As soon as that broke through, he would
                                            take action against Zhou Weiqing. In his eyes, with his four-Jeweled
                                            cultivation level, it would be extremely easy to kill off the three-Jeweled
                                            Zhou Weiqing. Both were Spatial Attribute Heavenly Jewel Masters, and he
                                            himself had the Agility Type Physical Jewel. After killing him, it would be
                                            easy to escape.</p>
                                        <p>However, despite the thoughts, Yun Li still did not move. As he battled
                                            himself within the deepest reaches of his heart, his body was trembling, his
                                            eyes revealing a blood lust. Yet, he did not move.</p>
                                        <p>Although he was filled with pride, but he had also never been a person who
                                            would break his word! Despite all the unwillingness in his heart, the
                                            unreconciled feelings he had, he still wasn’t willing to become a
                                            treacherous, disloyal person, a person who would be scoffed at by any
                                            others. After all, there was a huge crowd outside who had witnessed the bet.
                                            Could he really just go back on his word like that? More importantly, even
                                            if he did so, that would leave a mark, a shadow in his heart. With such a
                                            shadow in his heart, he would never be able to reach the peak of
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master… the peak that he had always longed for… to
                                            be a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood there silently, a faint smile on his face. He did not try
                                            to force Yun Li, or influence him in any way, but just stood there waiting
                                            for his own decision. Even with a Seal to restrict a person, it definitely
                                            wasn’t what he wanted. After all, there was a big difference between a
                                            willing Follower, and a Follower who complied in appearance but secretly
                                            opposed it in his heart. What Zhou Weiqing wanted was a Follower who truly
                                            worked for him with all his heart. In fact, Zhou Weiqing was extremely
                                            nervous. Naturally, it wasn’t due to fear that Yun Li might attack him.
                                            According to Zhou Weiqing’s estimation, although Yun Li was four-Jeweled, he
                                            did have a Legendary Set design. That meant that it was likely he only had
                                            two Consolidated Equipment. Even Ming Hua, who had four pieces of a Set
                                            Equipment, wasn’t a match for Zhou Weiqing, how could Yun Li be! If they
                                            truly had to fight, Zhou Weiqing had the confidence to beat, or even kill
                                            him off.</p>
                                        <p>“I have lost.” Those three words finally came out of Yun Li’s mouth, with
                                            much difficulty and bitterness. After saying those words, he folded down
                                            into the sofa behind him, like a deflated balloon, his eyes closed as tears
                                            streamed down his cheeks uncontrollably.</p>
                                        <p>“It’s my pride that destroyed me. Teacher, I have shamed you. I’ve lost… I’ve
                                            lost to a Consolidating Equipment Master whose cultivation level and rank is
                                            lower than mine.” Yun Li suddenly burst out crying, his body shaking as he
                                            lost control of his emotions.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to Yun Li’s crying, Zhou Weiqing was smiling, relaxedly. With
                                            that, he knew that he had gotten his first Follower. This was indeed a
                                            companion he could trust. Under such a circumstance, Zhou Weiqing was not
                                            confident that he could make the same decision, and that he might even break
                                            his own word. Yet, Yun Li had made the difficult choice. After all, there
                                            was no signed contract or bond they had done for this bet. If he had really
                                            wanted to run away, Zhou Weiqing might not have been able to stop him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing sat down silently once more, slowly keeping his own designs.</p>
                                        <p>He was not in a rush, allowing Yun Li to cry his heart out. After all, the
                                            poor fellow had just lost his lifetime freedom, how could he not allow him
                                            some time to vent?</p>
                                        <p>Currently, our dear Zhou Weiqing was grinning away in his heart. Although it
                                            had taken much effort, he had finally gotten a High Level Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master follower! Such good luck might never happen a second time,
                                            at least not before he became a lot more powerful than he currently was.</p>
                                        <p>Qin Feng and Shangguan Bing’er, who were outside, were startled by the sudden
                                            crying sound that came from within. Shangguan Bing’er could instantly tell
                                            that the crying sound was not Zhou Weiqing’s, but that did not stop her from
                                            feeling anxious and worried.</p>
                                        <p>“Young lady, calm down, we can’t enter right now.” Qin Feng quickly stopped
                                            her from trying to rush in. After all, he had given his word that they would
                                            not be disturbed in that chamber.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er was extremely worried in her heart, but right at that
                                            moment, a soft voice suddenly entered her ears. After a short, startled
                                            moment, she finally quietened down. Her pale, frightened face turning rosy
                                            red once more, and a faint smile crossed her lips.</p>
