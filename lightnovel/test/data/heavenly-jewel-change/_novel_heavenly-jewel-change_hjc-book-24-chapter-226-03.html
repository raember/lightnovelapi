                                            and it must have been the elites of the young generation from the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace. If even they had not been successful in their
                                            investigations, then Yun Li knew it would also be a difficult task for him.
                                            Furthermore, after entering the Lustre Spatial Realm, their positions would
                                            all be random, and not placed together. As such, if there were any sudden
                                            dangers, they would have to deal with it on their own without help from
                                            their team. Zhou Weiqing was thinking of his safety after all.</p>
                                        <p>Although he was rather unwilling to do so, in the end Yun Li nodded in
                                            agreement. As for Ma Qun and Crow, they were also disappointed about not
                                            being able to participate, but they had no choice. After all, their
                                            cultivation level had not reached the required stage yet.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin waved his hands, and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace personnel
                                            moved forward to present those Battle Team members who were entering the
                                            Lustre Spatial Realm with a set of Spatial Ring and Lustre Gem.</p>
                                        <p>Nodding his head, Shangguan Longyin said: “In the Spatial Ring you just
                                            received, there is sufficient food and water for thirty days. Prepare
                                            yourselves now, the teleportation will now begin.” As he said that, he
                                            lifted his hand and nodded towards the ten Elders behind him.</p>
                                        <p>Ten white figures moved as one immediately, as they moved backwards in a
                                            flash, disappearing into the thick mist.</p>
                                        <p>The mist around the Heaven’s Expanse Palace slowly began to change colour,
                                            the original white taking on a faint silver hue as the energy reverberations
                                            of the Spatial Attribute grew stronger and more obvious.</p>
                                        <p>The rich Heavenly Energy around gave all of them an extremely comfortable
                                            feeling, and the silver colour of the mist grew stronger and stronger.
                                            Slowly, the silver mist began to swirl around Shangguan Longyin’s body in a
                                            whirlwind.</p>
                                        <p>Piercing silver light began to shine forth from the centre of the whirlpool,
                                            and slowly the silver began to turn to gold from within the centre, as if a
                                            door was being opened. If one focused hard enough, they could almost sense
                                            that another world lay behind the gold light.</p>
                                        <p>As the gateway to the Lustre Spatial Realm was open, Zhou Weiqing
                                            subconsciously held onto Tian’er’s small hand. Both of them exchanged looks,
                                            and nothing else need to be said, as they instantly understood each
                                            other.</p>
                                        <p>As for the three Shangguan Sisters, their gazes all landed on Zhou Weiqing,
                                            though the three sisters had different expressions.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er was her usual icy cold self, as if expressionless. However,
                                            if one who knew her well examined her closely, they would be able to see a
                                            slight hint of envy in the depths of her eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er had her lips pursed, looking at Zhou Weiqing with unfriendly
                                            eyes, while Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes were gentle, without any reaction as
                                            looked at Zhou Weiqing holding onto Tian’er’s hand.</p>
                                        <p>Abruptly, Shangguan Longyin shouted out loud: “You may enter now, hurry up!
                                            Remember, no matter what, do not risk yourselves unnecessarily. As soon as
                                            you discover anything isn’t right, immediately use the Lustre Gem to
                                            transport yourselves out…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing, still holding onto Tian’er’s hand, was actually the first one
                                            to step forward. In a bright flash, both of them disappeared into the Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm.</p>
                                        <p>In a step, they entered the gold light. Instantly, both Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Tian’er felt an indescribable sense of freedom filling them, and the entire
                                            world around them turned illusory. Next, a massive suction force began to
                                            pull upon their bodies, and in a swoosh, they felt as if they had moved an
                                            uncountable distance in a single instant.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, the immense force of the Lustre Spatial Realm attempted
                                            to separate the two, but at the same time, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had been
                                            constantly keeping up the large Saint Energy whirlpool, and in that instant
                                            they circulated their Saint Energy to the greatest effect, unleashing it
                                            around them.</p>
                                        <p>With Shangguan Longyin’s warning, they naturally understood that entering the
                                            Lustre Spatial Realm this time would not be an easy task, and they would
                                            have to face large troubles. Under such a circumstance, if they wanted to
                                            investigate clearly what had happened, safety was their paramount importance
                                            first. To ensure that, being together was also of critical importance. As a
                                            result, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had decided to give a try to see if they
                                            could still maintain their transport together.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why Zhou Weiqing did not call upon the three Shangguan Sisters was
                                            not because they were on a different Battle Team, but because he did not
                                            have the confidence that this would work in the first place, let alone being
                                            able to protect so many others as well. However, if it were just him and
                                            Tian’er, that might be different.</p>
                                        <p>As the large Saint Energy whirlpool churned rapidly, a layer of thick silver
                                            white light instantly encapsulated the couple. The rest of the world around
                                            them was still a misty gold hue, but as soon as the silver white light
                                            appeared, both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er felt the dragging sensation on their
                                            bodies disappear at once.</p>
                                        <p>Their judgement had been accurate after all. The Saint Energy was an
                                            Attribute that was above all others, and even with the extremely powerful
                                            Spatial Attribute power of the Lustre Spatial Realm, it was unable to
                                            influence them under the protection of the Saint Energy. This was a total
                                            difference in stage.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>In a flash, the world began to reappear around them.</p>
                                        <p>Unlike the previous time they had entered the Lustre Spatial Realm, this time
                                            Zhou Weiqing did not feel the sense of out-of-sorts discomfort. After all,
                                            not only was his cultivation level much higher than before, his body and
                                            ability to withstand pressure was also much stronger. More so, he was also
                                            much more familiar with the Spatial Attribute and the pressure, far beyond
                                            the state he had been in the previous time.</p>
                                        <p>However, in the next instant, both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s expressions
                                            changed.</p>
                                        <p>The sensation of searing heat instantaneously overwhelmed their entire
                                            bodies. It had to be known that they were currently at the sixth and seventh
                                            Jeweled stages respectively, and ordinary high temperatures would not easily
                                            affect them. Furthermore, both their physiques were far tougher and stronger
                                            than any ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master, and for them to actually feel such
                                            heat, one could imagine the sheer temperature in the Lustre Spatial
                                            Realm.</p>
                                        <p>The truth of the matter was as bad as they had thought. As soon as the world
                                            came into clarity around the pair, both of them immediately saw a patch of
                                            hazy red in front of them.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, it was an entire hazy red. Besides red, in a short period of time,
                                            they actually could not see any other colours around.</p>
                                        <p>Just around them, there were large amounts of trees which were burning up in
                                            violent flames, and all the smaller plants around were already dried and
                                            withered. All about them, they could see the earth was parched and even
                                            cracked. Terrifying Fire Attribute Heavenly Energy raged through the skies,
                                            wave after wave bringing the heat continuously, as if wanting to turn them
                                            into mere fuel.</p>
                                        <p>Facing such an environment, though both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er were
                                            surprised, it was still not sufficient to affect them much. Instantly, their
                                            Heavenly Energy released, forming a milky white shield of light around them,
                                            forcefully cutting off the flames and temperature from affecting them.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s brow furrowed slightly and he said solemnly: “It looks like
                                            things have really gone seriously wrong in the Lustre Spatial Realm.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er nodded and said: “What do we do now? Which direction should we head?”
                                            Originally, she had planned to nag at Zhou Weiqing slightly once they were
                                            alone in the Lustre Spatial Realm. However, from the way things looked, the
                                            situation would no longer allow her to do so.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing paused to think for a while, before he finally said: “Wait here
                                            a moment, I’ll fly up to have a quick look.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er was caught by surprise, saying: “You want to fly up? Haven’t you
                                            forgotten what happened the last time?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile and said: “We do not have much of a choice
                                            now with such an environment… While it might not be too harmful for us, it
                                            is just too difficult to navigate or find anything. Furthermore, since the
                                            Lustre Spatial Realm has become like this, I am certain it has something to
                                            do with the dragons. Besides the two Dragons, who else would have such power
                                            to turn the entire Lustre Spatial Realm into an ocean of fire? I need to fly
                                            up to have a look, at least determine what is going on in the surroundings
                                            first before I can make any decisions.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er nodded, convinced. However, she still said: “Alright then, but do be
                                            very careful. As soon as you think anything is amiss, use your Saint Energy
                                            to protect yourself.”</p>
                                        <p>Nodding, Zhou Weiqing did not speak any further, instantly entering the
                                            Dragon-Tiger Transformation State. The wings behind his back unfurled,
                                            beating hard abruptly as he soared into the skies.</p>
                                        <p>The vegetation in the Lustre Spatial Realm were all extremely precious
                                            treasures. After all, it was obvious that such flames had been burning
                                            violently for much more than a day or two, yet the ‘fuel’ that these
                                            vegetation had become were still able to endure and hold on. Zhou Weiqing
                                            had to charge past a massive patch of flames before he finally reached the
                                            skies.</p>
                                        <p>However, as soon as his body burst through the canopy into the skies, he was
                                            immediately stunned by the sight before his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Fire. Fire everywhere. As far as his eyes could see, the entire Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm was completely immersed in red flames. Even stranger, although
                                            the flames were everywhere, there was no smoke at all. The thick Fire
                                            Attribute energies in the air seemed to repel the existence of any other
                                            attributes. The temperature in the skies was surprisingly even higher than
                                            that of the ground, as the blazing flames engulfed the entire air wave after
                                            wave, making it truly look like an ocean of flames.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing drew a deep breath. Facing such a situation, even he did not
                                            have any bright ideas left. All he could do was to attempt to find a
                                            direction to advance towards, and see what they could find.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing’s expression abruptly changed as he
                                            suddenly felt an incomparable and terrifying spiritual pressure force down
                                            upon him.</p>
                                        <p>Without any hesitation, the wings behind Zhou Weiqing’s back wrapped around
                                            his body. Around the wings, he poured in his Saint Energy without thought
                                            about wastage.</p>
                                        <p>*Puuu* A soft sound rang out, as the flames around Zhou Weiqing’s body in a
                                            hundred zhang radius were instantly extinguished by the massive blow, and
                                            his body plummeted down from the skies, smashing down onto the ground in a
                                            moment.</p>
                                        <p>“Dragon… it’s one of the dragons...” Zhou Weiqing gasped out instantly.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er rushed to his side, holding Zhou Weiqing’s hand as the pair quickly
                                            established the large Saint Energy whirlpool to help him recover.</p>
                                        <p>“What happened?” Tian’er asked concernedly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing replied: “I am certain that it was one of the Dragons who
                                            attacked me. Just now, a powerful spiritual blow sent me falling down. If I
                                            hadn’t used the Saint Energy to protect myself, perhaps I would have been
                                            severely injured just now…”</p>
                                        <p>The Dragons were Heavenly God Tier powerhouses, and their strength was
                                            definitely far beyond what Zhou Weiqing or Tian’er could handle.</p>
                                        <p>However, even as he spoke about that, Zhou Weiqing’s brow furrowed as he
                                            continued: “I still think something is amiss. Although that spiritual
                                            pressure was definitely from one of the Dragons, but I could sense that its
                                            spirit was filled with craziness… as if from deep within, wanting to destroy
                                            everything. Previously, when we entered the Lustre Spatial Realm, even when
                                            their child was in trouble, they did not show any of such craziness. I am
                                            now absolutely certain that the core reason for the troubles of the Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm is because something happened to the Dragons.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er also furrowed her brow, saying: “In that case, are we really going to
                                            look for them? It will be a huge risk… after all, in front of those Dragons,
                                            even if we have the Lustre Gem to teleport us back, it will still be a great
                                            danger. If we are not careful, we can be utterly destroyed even before we
                                            can activate it.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “That might be true for others, but
                                            since we have the Saint Energy to protect us, at least it should grant us
                                            sufficient time to activate the Lustre Gem and escape. Come on, just now I
                                            sensed the direction from which the spiritual pressure came from. We might
                                            as well investigate right now. After all, previously we have helped the
                                            Dragons, and as long as they have some lucidity and senses left within them,
                                            we should still be able to communicate.”</p>
                                        <p>Right at this moment, Tian’er was placing Zhou Weiqing at priority and as a
                                            leader. As a woman, she wanted to support her man no matter what he did, and
                                            not try to assert herself over him.</p>
