                                            State to continue the transformation of his Heavenly Energy, otherwise he
                                            might run into trouble in the further steps.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the tiger tattoos appear on Zhou Weiqing’s skin, as well as the
                                            bursting of his shirt as his muscles bulged out, the middle aged man’s eyes
                                            widened further, the surprise in them turning to sheer shock.</p>
                                        <p>His mouth twitched, and Long Shiya could hear him mutter: “Truly richly
                                            endowed by nature.”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, Zhou Weiqing had already displayed three Elemental Attributes, and
                                            now with the Demonic Change State, more so a controllable one, what else
                                            could he be described with? For any powerful Heavenly Jewel Master, if they
                                            could gain such a disciple, they would undoubtedly be on cloud nine. This
                                            was truly a talent that would invoke jealousy.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya could not resist any further, and a pleased smirk crossed his
                                            lips.</p>
                                        <p>In the Demonic Change State, Zhou Weiqing instantly felt more relaxed.
                                            Although this would greatly increase the drain of Heavenly Energy, it was
                                            also without question a great help to his control.</p>
                                        <p>The silver light flashed and began to diffuse, slowly turning to a black
                                            colour, thick and deep. The Darkness Attribute, perhaps the closest or most
                                            intimate Attribute of Zhou Weiqing’s. After all, his father also had the
                                            same Attribute. In the Demonic Change State, he could clearly sense the icy
                                            cold Darkness aura, and Zhou Weiqing slowly closed his eyes. At this point,
                                            he was no longer using his eyes to see, but his heart to sense his
                                            surroundings.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the change in Zhou Weiqing, Long Shiya couldn’t help but nod in
                                            approval. This disciple of his was not only unbelievably talented, even his
                                            intelligence, perception and capability of understanding was extremely
                                            strong. Although Zhou Weiqing had only started on the transformation of the
                                            fourth Attribute, Long Shiya was already extremely satisfied. After just
                                            half a year of training, being able to do so much, it was clear that it
                                            wasn’t just talent, but insanely hard work for Zhou Weiqing to be able to
                                            reach such a standard.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, when he saw Zhou Weiqing fight with Butler, Long Shiya was still
                                            a little worried. After all, Zhou Weiqing already had such powerful Stored
                                            Skills, and immersing himself in the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts
                                            would mean no improvement in power in the near future, perhaps even
                                            affecting his cultivation of Heavenly Energy. Would such a young man be able
                                            to keep at it with such so many short term drawbacks? In that moment, Long
                                            Shiya had began to question it.</p>
                                        <p>After all, no matter who it was, when one had such an unbelievable talent,
                                            and had clearly always improved so quickly… If he had to change to another
                                            cultivation method that did not have much clear gains, it was definitely not
                                            an easy thing to take. This was also the reason why Long Shiya had instantly
                                            asked Zhou Weiqing to show him the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts as
                                            soon as he saw him, to show the fruits of his training. Long Shiya had
                                            finally found a disciple after so long, and he did not wish for his precious
                                            disciple to end up being a rotten log.</p>
                                        <p>The truth had proven his worried were unfounded. Zhou Weiqing’s willpower and
                                            tenacity was far beyond most of those around the same age, and his character
                                            much more stable. He was able to keep at the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation
                                            Arts, putting in much effort in its training, also able to bring his teacher
                                            much face. The more Long Shiya looked at his disciple, the more pleased he
                                            was. Even if he was trying to best not to show emotion, it was hard for him.
                                            It was as if he had gotten a true son at an old age, as smug and pleased as
                                            one could be.</p>
                                        <p>The black light in Zhou Weiqing’s hands started to shrink, changing at the
                                            same time, in a very strange way. This time, Zhou Weiqing did not seize the
                                            advantage by imitating a Skill that he had Stored, instead forming a small
                                            ball of black light.</p>
                                        <p>The strange thing was that in the black ball, there was still a swirling dim
                                            green light. This was a Ball of Corrosion.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya also had the Darkness Attribute, and with a single look he could
                                            tell that this time Zhou Weiqing was totally using his Heavenly Energy to
                                            imitate the Skill, and did not have such a Skill Stored. From this, Long
                                            Shiya was confident that Zhou Weiqing had already truly entered the
                                            threshold of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, this was not the end. How could a person who could enter the
                                            Demonic Change State not have the Demonic Attribute? The speed of
                                            transformation from the Darkness Attribute to the Demonic Attribute was much
                                            faster, as the black turned into grey, a thick grey forming a small
                                            whirlwind around Zhou Weiqing’s palm, whirling at astonishing speed, causing
                                            the various elemental energies in the atmosphere to be drawn in towards it
                                            and making the whirlwind grow larger.</p>
                                        <p>A pleased look appeared on Zhou Weiqing’s face. This grey whirlpool was truly
                                            his greatest accomplishment thus far, and was also one of the greatest aid
                                            to his current power ever since he had started training in the Six Ultimate
                                            Skill Manipulation Arts. What he was doing now was using the Six Ultimate
                                            Skill Manipulation Arts to imitate the Devour Skill of the Demonic
                                            Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>After all, in order for Zhou Weiqing to use his personal Devour Skill, he had
                                            to use his palm to actually touch his opponent’s body. Conversely, he was
                                            able to draw in the various Elemental Attribute Heavenly Energy directly
                                            from the atmosphere now. That was to say, this Devour Skill that he used
                                            with the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts was now able to go from
                                            range.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Devouring from the atmosphere was definitely not as good as
                                            Devouring directly from a Heavenly Jewel Master or Heavenly Beast, not only
                                            was the Heavenly Energy mixed with all sorts of Attributes, it was much
                                            tougher to draw and absorb, the entire process much slower as well, and the
                                            cleansing and re absorption process later was also much delayed.</p>
                                        <p>Still, this was considered a Skill that Zhou Weiqing had created by himself!
                                            This external energy whirlpool, when combined with his internal Death
                                            Acupuncture Point energy whirlpools, it would undoubtedly be a great boost
                                            to his cultivation level.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy was now at the nineteenth stage. He had
                                            actually successfully crafted this new Devour Whirlpool Skill a month ago.
                                            Originally, when he had started committing full on in training the Six
                                            Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, his Heavenly Energy cultivation had slowed
                                            dramatically. Thanks to his Immortal Deity Technique, it was not as bad as
                                            Long Shiya had feared, but it was still only fully dependent on the normal
                                            draw of the energy whirlpools. At that point, he had still been quite some
                                            distance from breaking through his nineteenth death Acupuncture Point.
                                            However, after mastering this new Devour Whirlpool Skill, Zhou Weiqing had
                                            only used ten days before he had reached the Heavenly Energy requirement to
                                            break through the next stage. With the aid of the Demonic Change State and
                                            Solidified Dragon Spirit, he had actually managed to successfully break
                                            through, and was now only one stage away from his fifth Heavenly Jewel.</p>
                                        <p>This was also one of the reasons why he had been more confident in facing
                                            Butler earlier today.</p>
                                        <p>Upon seeing this Devour Whirlpool Skill, even Long Shiya was dumbfounded.
                                            After all, he did not have the Demonic Attribute of his own, but with his
                                            knowledge, experience and vision, how could he not see the miraculous use of
                                            this whirlpool? Envy… this teacher was almost starting to envy his own
                                            disciple… his talent was just too unbelievable. Long Shiya was now sure that
                                            if Zhou Weiqing continued training hard with his own guidance, he could
                                            definitely break through the Heavenly King Stage before the age of
                                            thirty.</p>
                                        <p>The middle aged man beside Long Shiya finally couldn’t hold back any longer,
                                            and he spoke out: “Fatty Long, where did you find such a monstrous little
                                            brat. Why do I not have your luck? My moral standing is clearly much better
                                            than you!!”</p>
                                        <p>“Bullshit, what moral standing? Your Father, I, is the one with the true
                                            upright moral standing. Look, even the heavens are taking care of me… aren’t
                                            you jealous now? Let me tell you, Weiqing is my disciple, don’t even think
                                            about it, I will definitely not let you have him. Do you know how hard it
                                            has been before I finally found a disciple with six Attributes?”</p>
                                        <p>“Six? You mean he still has another Attribute?! What is it?” The middle aged
                                            man exclaimed, his jaw agape.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said airly: “Look for yourself.”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, it was being displayed right before his eyes right now. As soon as
                                            the grey whirlpool appeared in Zhou Weiqing’s hands, the sweat on his
                                            forehead had actually lessened instead. With this Devour Whirlpool Skill,
                                            his Heavenly Energy was actually recuperating at a slightly faster speed
                                            than draining. Although it was only temporary, it was still sufficient for
                                            him to use. That was the reason why Zhou Weiqing had chosen to imitate that
                                            Skill as well, as it was the only way he could possibly complete the last,
                                            and most difficult, transformation and Skill.</p>
                                        <p>The grey whirlpool slowly faded from sight, but it was only the light
                                            dissipating, and the whirlpool was still somehow there in compressed form.
                                            Zhou Weiqing had used another difficult control technique of the Six
                                            Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts; one that could only be used with
                                            sufficient Heavenly Energy, which luckily had been replenished by his Devour
                                            Whirlpool.</p>
                                        <p>A similar Skill, but of different Attribute. This was the control technique
                                            that Zhou Weiqing was using. A similar whirlpool, but as the grey vanished,
                                            the whirlpool had turned transparent entirely, with only the twisting of
                                            light all around proving that it still existed, and both Long Shiya and the
                                            middle aged man could sense its power.</p>
                                        <p>The Time Disorder Skill. Another Skill that Zhou Weiqing had Stored
                                            previously. Attempting to imitate any Time Attribute Skill was just too
                                            difficult, as it was one of the strongest and most difficult Elemental
                                            Attributes. After training for so long, this was the only one that Zhou
                                            Weiqing had succeeded in. As such, he could only use it out right now. At
                                            the same time, he could only succeed with the advantage from the ‘similar
                                            Skill, different Attribute’ technique, greatly lowering the difficulty.</p>
                                        <p>Having finally completed all six transformations, Zhou Weiqing finally let go
                                            of his breath with a tiny sigh of relief as he carefully dismissed the
                                            invisible whirlpool in his palm. Once it was gone, his body sagged down in
                                            relief and his eyes opened wide once again. The sweat which had almost
                                            disappeared suddenly poured down abruptly, drenching him at once. It was
                                            clear how much spirit and mental toll it had taken on him just to complete
                                            the six transformations, and it showed in the sheer exhausted state he was
                                            left in.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had not seen the pleased, smug look on Long Shiya’s face,
                                            instead all he saw was the slightly furrowed brow on his face.</p>
                                        <p>“Teacher, did I do anything wrongly?” Zhou Weiqing asked tentatively. He had
                                            been so confident that he had already done the best he could, and if this
                                            was still not enough, he had nothing left to give.</p>
