                                            strong as one could be. Yet, right at this moment, in front of Long Shiya,
                                            he truly felt that his strength was of no match at all.</p>
                                        <p>Just in that single palm strike alone, though it might have seemed very
                                            simple, he had truly suffered a major disadvantage. With Long Shiya’s Six
                                            Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation, his six Attribute Heavenly Energy had
                                            truly merged together, and though his overall Heavenly Energy output was
                                            only slightly higher than Gu Site, the effect and offensive capabilities of
                                            the fusion was far superior to his own output. It was truly a case of
                                            quality over quantity. Furthermore, that was not even considering that Long
                                            Shiya was at the Max Level of the Heavenly Emperor Stage, even higher than
                                            himself. In just the single blow, the Lion King felt a terrifying power
                                            overcome him like waves from a boundless ocean… as if the entire space
                                            around them was fully under Long Shiya’s control.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the thirty six blades of light spring into existence in front of him,
                                            the Lion King could no longer care about face. Along with several continuous
                                            bouts of dark gold light flashing, an entire set of nine God Tier
                                            Consolidated Equipment appeared, coalescing into form around his body.
                                            Although it was no match for the Heavenly Snow Mountain’s own God
                                            Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set, it was already a rare and exceptional
                                            Legendary Set in the entire mainland.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion King Gu Site’s weapon was a massive heavy bastard sword, and as it
                                            pointed ahead, a strong red light shot forth into the skies. Behind his
                                            back, the illusory image of a huge gold-red ferocious lion appeared. It was
                                            clear that he was going all out now.</p>
                                        <p>The Tiger King Xue Aoying stood at the side unmoving, without any thought of
                                            intervening. Regarding Long Shiya, he was far more familiar than Gu Site
                                            was, especially since he had twice personally witnessed fights between Long
                                            Shiya and his brother Xue AoTian. He knew that Xue AoTian had an extremely
                                            high opinion and appraisal of Long Shiya. He had once told Xue Aoying that
                                            even for himself, even if he wanted to defeat Long Shiya, it would be
                                            extremely tough even for him, and would take him a lot of time and effort to
                                            do so. The Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation that Long Shiya had
                                            created could be said to be the greatest formation and invention today, and
                                            nothing could compare. If not for the fact that Long Shiya had not managed
                                            to break through to the Heavenly God Tier, the title of strongest powerhouse
                                            alive today would possibly be different now. At the same time, Xue AoTian
                                            had also told Xue Aoying very seriously that even if they offended the other
                                            four Great Saint Lands, they must never offend Long Shiya. The reason was
                                            simple - he was alone in the world with no other care. Such a powerhouse, if
                                            he truly wanted to cause trouble for them, even the Heavenly Snow Mountain
                                            would be hard pressed to deal with them. Of course, this was also because
                                            Xue AoTian did not have any reason to attempt to kill Long Shiya as
                                            well.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, Long Shiya coming here today to cause trouble definitely
                                            had some reason behind it, and without knowing the true reason, Xue Aoying
                                            would not take action.</p>
                                        <p>The competition and rivalry between the Lion Tribe and Tiger Tribe could be
                                            said to be existent since the start of the WanShou Empire. This time, for Gu
                                            Yingbing to marry Tian’er, in truth Xue Aoying was rather vexed by it in his
                                            heart. He was extremely clear that once Gu Yingbing inherited the position
                                            of Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, their Tiger Tribe would be in a downward
                                            spiral and their future would not be good.</p>
                                        <p>Even though the Tiger Tribe would take over the position of the Royal Family
                                            and Emperor of the WanShou Empire, that would not mean they could control
                                            the Lion Tribes. On the contrary, when that time came, the Lion Tribe would
                                            have the backing of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, having a higher status above
                                            all, and they would not need to listen to the Tiger Tribe even if they were
                                            the Royal Family. It was the exact status that the Tiger Tribe enjoyed right
                                            now, not Royal but having a status above the Lion Tribe. This was the power
                                            of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, one of the top Great Saint Lands.</p>
                                        <p>As a result, watching the Lion King Gu Site taking a disadvantage right now,
                                            Xue Aoying was more than happy to just keep watching; how could he possibly
                                            lend a hand? Let alone the fact that he did not think he could take on Long
                                            Shiya; even if he could he would still not take action. The fact that the
                                            Tiger Tribe did not have any talented geniuses in the younger generation
                                            that were outstanding enough to inherit the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord
                                            position was already vexing enough to him, and he was definitely in no mood
                                            to assist the Lion King without a good reason.</p>
                                        <p>Each and every one of the thirty six blades of light could be said to have
                                            the offensive power of maximum Heavenly Emperor. However, even at the
                                            Heavenly Emperor Stage himself, the Lion King Gu Site did not think he could
                                            come up with thirty six similar attacks at the same time; otherwise how
                                            could he not care about his own face and unleash all of his entire Legendary
                                            Set at once before his opponent had even used one.</p>
                                        <p>With a wave of his large hand, Long Shiya continued standing there unmoving,
                                            but the thirty six blades of light flew towards the Lion King Gu Site at top
                                            speed, as if they had eyes of their own.</p>
                                        <p>From an outside perspective, the clash of these two Heavenly Emperors did not
                                            seem particularly flashy or powerful, perhaps even less startling than two
                                            nine-Jeweled Upper Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters. Yet, in truth,
                                            that was because all their attacks were highly compressed, and may not look
                                            as impressive as their true power might be. Furthermore, this was after all
                                            the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and the two restrained themselves to prevent too
                                            much possible property damage.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion King Gu Site’s body starting spinning abruptly, gripping his heavy
                                            bastard sword in both hands, his entire person becoming like a massive fiery
                                            tornado. Spinning crazily, he ignored the six coloured lights striking
                                            towards him, instead charging straight towards Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>With his entire crimson red Legendary Set boosting him, currently the Lion
                                            King’s power had reached the Maximum stage of the Heavenly Emperor
                                            cultivation state.</p>
                                        <p>Facing such a whirlwind attack, if it had been the Tiger King Xue Aoying, he
                                            could only attempt to dodge it. However, Long Shiya did not even make a
                                            move, nor did he seem to care at all.</p>
                                        <p>A spark of light flashed in Long Shiya’s eyes, and the thirty six blades of
                                            light formed an array in front of him like a beautiful necklace stringing
                                            various different coloured beads, before intercepting the fiery red spinning
                                            figure of Gu Site.</p>
                                        <p>*Flop**Flop**Flop**Flop*</p>
                                        <p>A series of strange sounds rang out, as the blades of light smashed into the
                                            fiery whirlpool of crimson one after the other, vanishing as they did so.
                                            However, every strike from a blade would cause the crimson glow of the
                                            tornado to lower a little, slowing it down bit by bit.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya’s right hand lifted once again. This time, in a grab towards the
                                            empty space above his head. At once, lights of the same six colours started
                                            gathering at crazy speeds above his head, slowly gathering into and forming
                                            a massive six-coloured hammer.</p>
                                        <p>The consolidation speed of the hammer was rather slow, and behind his back,
                                            the illusory image of Long Shiya seemed to become even more solid and real.
                                            For the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor to have to gather power in order to
                                            unleash this Skill, one could imagine its power.. However, at this moment,
                                            Lion King Gu Site could not do anything else as all his attention was in
                                            blocking the thirty six blades of light.</p>
                                        <p>Suppression, an all-round, total suppression. As an outside observer, this
                                            was the only phrase that the Tiger King Xue Aoying could use to describe
                                            this fight. In front of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, even
                                            the High Level Heavenly Emperor Lion King Gu Site did not have any chance at
                                            all!</p>
                                        <p>Originally, when he was watching Long Shiya fighting against Xue Aotian, Xua
                                            Aoying did not have such a strong and intense feeling. However, when the
                                            opponent was changed to Gu Site, only then did he truly feel the terrifying
                                            power of Long Shiya. If that person fighting was himself, he knew that he
                                            would most likely fare even worse than Gu Site.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that massive, nearly ten metre long, six-coloured hammer forming, the
                                            Lion King Gu Site was also both surprised and getting worried. Those blades
                                            of light that seemed so easily summoned by Long Shiya had taken so much to
                                            deal with, and every time one of them detonated against his whirlwind, it
                                            would spark a chain reaction of the six Attributes.</p>
                                        <p>More surprising to Gu Site was that the chain reaction for each blade was
                                            different, causing him to have to use all his strength and care in blocking
                                            each and every one of them. He estimated that he had to use almost two to
                                            three times the amount of Heavenly Energy that Long Shiya used, in order to
                                            actually take care of each blade.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, even while Long Shiya was controlling those thirty six blades of
                                            light to attack him, this Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor actually had the
                                            strength and attention to spare to charge up another Skill, one that was
                                            obviously far stronger. This was a total shock to Gu Site. Only at this
                                            point did he realise the true gap between him and Long Shiya, and he knew
                                            that it was likely his opponent had not even shown the extent of his
                                            strength.</p>
                                        <p>A gold light sprang forth from Gu Site’s body. At this point, he could not
                                            hold anything back. The Divine Attribute, one of the Saint Attributes,
                                            showed itself, and the giant illusory lion behind his back also turned gold,
                                            with Golden Saint Flames surrounding him. At last, he could start moving
                                            while blocking Long Shiya’s attacks, and he continued doggedly step by step
                                            towards his foe.</p>
                                        <p>“Scram!” Long Shiya gave a cold humph.. The massive six coloured hammer
                                            descended from the skies, but it did not slam down directly, instead
                                            sweeping horizontally to smash savagely into the whirlwind of gold flames
                                            that was Gu Site.</p>
                                        <p>This time… there was finally a loud explosion… an explosion that seemed to
                                            resound deep into every single one of the observers. In the huge ringing
                                            sound, the mass of gold and red light and flame actually flew back, smashing
                                            right off the Heavenly Snow Mountain and flying off into the distance.</p>
                                        <p>With another wave of Long Shiya’s right hand, a three metre long six-coloured
                                            sword appeared out of nowhere. The entire atmosphere seemed to warp around
                                            it, and in a flash of light, the sword flew towards Gu Site’s body, which
                                            was still flying off into the distance, the light surrounding him having
                                            dimmed to almost non-existence.</p>
                                        <p>“Fatty Long, show mercy!”</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a gold light descended from the skies, warping into a
                                            shield to block the final six-coloured sword that Long Shiya had
                                            unleashed.</p>
                                        <p>The sword and shield slammed into one another, and both visible swayed
                                            violently before they dissipated into the air simultaneously. Throughout the
                                            fight, Long Shiya had not moved a single step, but at this point he actually
                                            swayed slightly, though he still did not stagger back.</p>
                                        <p>A snow-white figure appeared out of nowhere, silent and swift. No one had
                                            seen how he had appeared, but as soon as he did so, everything seemed to
                                            become a mere background to his presence.</p>
                                        <p>“Bro Long, how are you?” The one who had stopped Long Shiya’s final blow and
                                            even caused him to shake slightly was naturally the Heavenly Snow Mountain
                                            Lord, the strongest powerhouse in the world, the only Heavenly God Tier
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master… Xue AoTian.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at him, Long Shiya gave a cold smirk and said: “Old Monster Xue, you
                                            are finally willing to show yourself.”</p>
                                        <p>At that point, the Lion King Gu Site had finally recovered his balance, and
                                            with his own powerful Heavenly Energy, he flew back to them. Although he did
                                            not have the Wind Attribute, that just meant he would not be able to fly too
                                            quickly or for long periods of time. For a short distance, using his
                                            Heavenly Energy to fly was still a possibility.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Gu Site was extremely vexed and disappointed. That blow from Long
                                            Shiya’s hammer had not actually harmed him, but it had almost dissipated all
                                            of his protective aura and Heavenly Energy. If that final sword had actually
                                            landed on him, even if it did not kill him, he would definitely be severely
                                            wounded. Yet, Long Shiya had not even unleashed a single Consolidated
                                            Equipment… It was clear how far the gap between the two of them were.</p>
                                        <p>“Mountain Lord.”</p>
                                        <p>Gu Site glared angrily at Long Shiya, but he still bowed respectfully to Xue
                                            AoTian first.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian smiled faintly and said: “Lion King, you do not need to be vexed.
                                            Losing to Bro Long is not something to be ashamed of. In this entire
                                            mainland, Bro Long can be considered the strongest Heavenly Emperor. Even
                                            for myself, I dare not say that I can definitely defeat him.”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian’s words could be considered extremely kind, giving Long Shiya a
                                            lot of face. Even if Long Shiya was acting aggressively now, his expression
                                            couldn’t help but ease up.</p>
                                        <p></p>
