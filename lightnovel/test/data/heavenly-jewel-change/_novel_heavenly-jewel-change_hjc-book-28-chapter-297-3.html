                                            absolutely no chance for the Destruction dueling sword to leave its
                                            hands.</p>
                                        <p>This was the difference in power - one was an imitation of a god, the other
                                            was a projection of a god. In terms of the power of their gods, Fen Tian
                                            ultimately could not match up to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Additionally, because of the fact that Zhou Weiqing possessed the Demon God
                                            bloodline, to a certain degree, the Demon God projection that he summoned
                                            would manifest some of his characteristics.</p>
                                        <p>Hence, as a result, the Demon God was extremely powerful, as Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            ten-piece Hate Ground No Handle Set had increased his strength by 1024
                                            times. One could well imagine how significant the boost in strength would
                                            be. Even without the Demon God, Fen Tian might still be unable to match up
                                            to Zhou Weiqing when it came to strength.</p>
                                        <p>The Demon God moved its right leg - it was Zhou Weiqing’s strongest body
                                            part. Its lightning-like leg headed straight for the side of the Destruction
                                            God’s body and kicked him hard.</p>
                                        <p>At this time, the Destruction God had two options - he could either abandon
                                            the sword or forcefully fight back.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Fen Tian was unwilling to give up on the dueling sword - he had a
                                            weapon but the Demon God did not. In his eyes, that was the strongest
                                            advantage he had over them as of now. Hence, he chose to fight back
                                            forcefully. The Destruction God lifted his left leg, with his knee facing
                                            outwards, blocking the kick from the Demon God’s right leg.</p>
                                        <p>Boom——</p>
                                        <p>It was another violent boom. The Destruction God bellowed, causing the
                                            Destruction Celestial Territory in the sky to temporarily scatter. It could
                                            be clearly seen from below that apart from the ball of distorted light
                                            spreading out, the Destruction God’s right leg had also become somewhat
                                            distorted as well. Evidently, he suffered a big loss.</p>
                                        <p>The disdain within the Demon God’s eyes became more intense. However, at this
                                            moment, he let go of the Destruction dueling sword instead, because the
                                            Destruction Energy that was constantly being emitted from the Destruction
                                            dueling sword had caused the Demon God’s hands to give way. Nonetheless, it
                                            was good enough - the Destruction God was only left with one leg. It was
                                            extremely clear who had the upper hand.</p>
                                        <p>The Demon God’s actions were simple - as he released the Destruction dueling
                                            sword, his body suddenly became illusory. The Destruction dueling sword
                                            swung across the illusory thousand meter tall figure, slicing through the
                                            air.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had thoroughly exhibited his dominance via Spatial Law. He
                                            controlled the Demon God and utilized the Spatial Law.</p>
                                        <p>As the battle progressed, Fen Tian began to reveal his experience. He
                                            immediately realized that something was amiss the moment the sword sliced
                                            through thin air. Hence, he had reacted instantly.</p>
                                        <p>He abandoned the sword. Ultimately, he had abandoned his dueling sword.
                                            Putting his palms together in front of his chest, he happened to block the
                                            Demon God’s thrust from its palm. A violent collision erupted in the sky in
                                            an instant; the two gods were actually engaged in hand-to-hand combat.
                                            Additionally, the Destruction God’s right leg had recovered at an alarming
                                            speed. After all, it was not its actual body - as long as there was enough
                                            Destruction Energy, he would not die.</p>
                                        <p>Fen Tian’s thousand meter long dueling sword descended directly onto the
                                            grounds of Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, creating an intense rumble just like
                                            an earthquake. As a result, a huge canyon was immediately formed within the
                                            Ten Thousand Beast Heavens. The ground split opened; terrifying Destruction
                                            Energy continued spreading for almost a hundred miles before it stopped,
                                            leaving a permanent mark within the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens. </p>
                                        <p>The battle between the Demon God and the Destruction God seemed as though it
                                            had just begun; the speed of the attacks from both sides was extremely fast.
                                            Even though their bodies were massive, if one were to watch from the ground
                                            below, only a purple and a gray figure could be seen flashing in the sky.
                                            Circles of distorted light started to spread out from the center of their
                                            collision, erupting powerful energy ripples.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the victor had finally emerged within one of the five ongoing
                                            battles.</p>
                                        <p>It was the battle between Long Shiya and Shen Mo.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Mo had constantly been on the offensive - his frenzied attacks had
                                            caused the enormous figure that Long Shiya had metamorphosed to continuously
                                            weaken, and its energy ripples had also constantly decreased. Shen Mo
                                            realized that the most important thing was that Long Shiya’s will was
                                            becoming weaker and weaker - to the point he somewhat could not control his
                                            body anymore.</p>
                                        <p>Apart from the fact that Shen Mo was overjoyed, it was clear that the Six
                                            Ultimate Heavenly God, who had just became a Heavenly God not long ago, had
                                            engaged his magical control power to perfectly exhibit his six attributes in
                                            a bid to contend against Shen Mo’s Destruction Energy earlier, and even hurt
                                            himself. He was manipulating countless amounts of energy the entire time!
                                            The amount of will drained must have been devastating. He should be done for
                                            now, right? He should be unable to keep up any longer.</p>
                                        <p>Even though launching continuous powerful attacks also consumed a significant
                                            amount of Shen Mo’s energy, he was still feeling rather good - physically.
                                            He thought that after killing Long Shiya, he would have at least
                                            approximately half of his Heavenly Energy left - all he needed to do was to
                                            make some adjustments before he could enter the battlefields on the
                                            ground.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Mo was not an idiot either - he was not going to face the Sidhe’s
                                            formation by himself as there were too many powerhouses there. Additionally,
                                            he had noticed that Dongfang Hanyue was the one who brought a lot of
                                            casualties to the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley. She had already
                                            killed off more than twenty Heavenly God powerhouses of both the Blood Red
                                            Hell and the Passion Valley all by herself. Currently, her killing rate had
                                            slowed down to a certain degree as she had consumed a great amount of
                                            energy. If Shen Mo were to retrain her himself, it would not be long before
                                            the battle ends in their favor. As for Huang Xingyun and his wife - he
                                            couldn't care less. It would be best if they were to perish together with
                                            the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
                                        <p>Even though the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley were working together,
                                            serving the same master, they had different interests. To Shen Mo, when
                                            faced with a life-and-death situation, Huang Xingyun had only one option,
                                            which was to self-detonate - the self-detonation of a Heavenly God. From the
                                            looks of it, it was likely that both parties would perish together. If that
                                            were to happen, it would only benefit the Blood Red Hell in terms of ruling
                                            over the entire Mainland in future.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Long Shiya struggle so hard to the point he was about to cave in,
                                            Shen Mo had started to think of his next battle technique. He was not
                                            worried about Fen Tian and Zhou Weiqing’s battle. As an observer, as well as
                                            a Heavenly God powerhouse, he was even clearer about the situation than Fen
                                            Tian himself. This was because he constantly remembered the fact that Zhou
                                            Weiqing was a mere Max Level Heavenly Emperor, who was not even a Heavenly
                                            God. Even though he did not know what kind of method he used to summon the
                                            Demon God, how long could the Demon God last anyway? As long as Fen Tian was
                                            able to summon the Destruction God longer than he did, it was impossible for
                                            Zhou Weiqing to win.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Shen Mo was deep in thoughts planning his moves, all of a sudden, a
                                            huge force of impact appeared. The force of impact came from the Sidhe’s
                                            Nature Celestial Territory Formation. That was not to say that the Sidhe was
                                            directing it at him - instead, due to the fact that the energy erupted from
                                            the collision between the Demon God and the Destruction God was way too
                                            powerful, it forced the Nature Celestial Territory to shift once again, and
                                            naturally caused the force of impact to be diverted to them as a result.</p>
                                        <p>They had experienced such a situation earlier, hence Shen Mo was not anxious.
                                            His attack had only slightly slowed down as a result, it was not a big deal.
                                            He had already planned it out in his head - once the energy in the
                                            surroundings had stabilized, he would deliver a fatal blow to Long
                                            Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>However, Shen Mo had never expected that at this moment, Long Shiya had
                                            launched his very first offensive attack, in the two battles he fought with
                                            Shen Mo.</p>
                                        <p>Two unimpressive halos floated from Long Shiya’s body. Due to Shen Mo’s
                                            continuous attacks, Long Shiya had already revealed his actual body. Hence,
                                            the two six-colored halos only looked as though they were approximately one
                                            meter in diameter. They were each released from Long Shiya’s head, as well
                                            as the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation below his feet. </p>
                                        <p><em>Was this his final struggle before death?</em> Shen Mo’s eyes were filled
                                            with disdain. He did not care much about Long Shiya’s attack. His devouring
                                            mouth was still as powerful as before - it opened up without any hesitation,
                                            and immediately tried to devour the attack.</p>
                                        <p>However, just as the enormous devouring mouth was about to close, the two
                                            unimpressive six-colored halos that were releasing ordinary energy ripples
                                            immediately increased their speed.</p>
                                        <p>The two halos did not directly shake up the devouring mouth - they merely
                                            swiftly moved towards each other. To put it more accurately, they had
                                            overlapped one another.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the devouring mouth had closed itself, devouring them.</p>
                                        <p>From the start of the battle, the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya’s
                                            chubby face had a grave expression on it the entire time. However, at this
                                            current moment, there was finally a faint smile on his face.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Mo happened to see Long Shiya’s facial expression. <em>What is he
                                            smiling at?</em> This was Shen Mo’s first thought. Immediately after, a bout
                                            of gentle energy ripples erupted from within the devouring mouth.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, the energy erupted in a very gentle manner. However, this gentle
                                            energy had caused the Destruction Attribute within his body to collapse at
                                            an extremely fast speed.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Mo’s enormous devouring mouth was created using his actual body together
                                            with his Celestial Territory. In a way, it was his actual body! The sudden
                                            collapse of his Destruction Energy had shocked him first. After snapping out
                                            of it, when he wanted to spit out the halos, he could no longer do it.</p>
                                        <p>A deep thud was heard and clouds of thick purplish black light mist erupted
                                            in the sky. The devouring mouth had vanished, and Shen Mo’s actual body
                                            appeared in mid-air.</p>
                                        <p>Except for the fact that the current him no longer had the joy of victory on
                                            his face. He looked at Long Shiya, with his right hand pointing at him and
                                            his left hand pressed against his chest, “You, you……”</p>
                                        <p>The Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya looked at Shen Mo with a smile on
                                            his face, “You’ve lost to yourself. If you were not as overconfident, this
                                            battle would have ended in mutual destruction instead. Alas, I’ve spent too
                                            much time with Little Fatty and ended up being led astray - learning how to
                                            deceive others.”</p>
                                        <p>Beneath Shen Mo’s palm was a small palm-sized six-colored halo that was
                                            embedded in his chest.</p>
