                                            had been a huge jolt to Zhou Weiqing. Naturally, how could he easily give up
                                            continuing to Skill Store the Demonic Dragon Lady? As such, when he had
                                            reached the Four Jewel stage, the first thing he thought of was the Demonic
                                            Dragon Lady.</p>
                                        <p>Although the Demonic Dragon Lady was only a Heavenly Emperor Stage Heavenly
                                            Beast, due to its fusion of Demonic and Darkness Attributes, its Skills were
                                            already very close to the Heavenly God Stage. That was also why the Demonic
                                            Dragon Lady’s Skills could actually summon the Heavenly Skill Image.</p>
                                        <p>A half step to the Heavenly God Stage meant it was already approaching the
                                            door to the Heavenly God Stage! For example that Absolute Skill of Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal… hadn’t Zhou Weiqing used it earlier to Seal a Heavenly God
                                            Stage Dragon? Even Tian’er, from the Heavenly Snow Mountain, could even feel
                                            jealous about such a skill, one could imagine how powerful the Demonic
                                            Dragon Lady’s Skills were.</p>
                                        <p>What Zhou Weiqing was currently unleashing was the second Skill that he had
                                            Stored from the Demonic Dragon Lady, also a Fusion of the Darkness and
                                            Demonic Attributes. The name of the Skill was the Demonic Dragon God Seal,
                                            and it was also one of the Demonic Dragon Lady’s top Skills.</p>
                                        <p>The Demonic Dragon God Seal’s effect was actually very simple, yet it was
                                            rated eleven and a half Stars, and the most important factor in that was
                                            because it too was an Absolute Skill.</p>
                                        <p>The Demonic Dragon God Seal was released through both eyes, and just like the
                                            Dragon Silencing Seal, it did not take any Heavenly Energy. As long as the
                                            person met eyes with the caster, and their Heavenly Energy cultivation level
                                            was less than four stages below the caster, then this Skill would take
                                            effect.</p>
                                        <p>Demonic Dragon God Seal. What it Sealed was the Spirit. That was to say, a
                                            person who had been afflicted with the Demonic Dragon God Seal would have
                                            his spirit and soul totally Sealed, becoming like a mindless zombie, totally
                                            under the control of the caster… almost to the extent of being like a
                                            duplicate body of the caster.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, there was also a simple, though huge, restriction on the Demonic
                                            Dragon God Seal. That was to say that only one of it could take effect at
                                            any time. If he wanted to control someone else, he would have to give up the
                                            control of the first person.</p>
                                        <p>On the surface, the Demonic Dragon God Seal did not seem as terrifying as the
                                            Dragon Silencing Seal. However, when Zhou Weiqing saw the introduction to
                                            this Skill, he instantly sensed how extraordinary it was.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, the Demonic Dragon God Seal would grow in power along with
                                            his cultivation level. If one day Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation level was at
                                            the Heavenly God Stage, then he could even control a Heavenly Emperor Stage
                                            powerhouse. Of course, the caveat was that he had to be four stages above
                                            the one he wanted to control.</p>
                                        <p>Many times, a critical linchpin to matters was not just so easily solved by
                                            martial prowess. This Skill could come in surprisingly handy at times. It
                                            could be said that with this Skill, it allowed Zhou Weiqing to have a puppet
                                            to control.</p>
                                        <p>Wasn’t it just a perfect situation right now?</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing held onto the quartermaster’s hand, infusing his Heavenly Energy
                                            into his body. With just a simple check, he easily sensed that though the
                                            quartermaster also had Heavenly Energy, it was only at the sixth stage, far
                                            below his own. Without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing immediately activated the
                                            Demonic Dragon God Seal.</p>
                                        <p>The Demonic Dragon God Seal was definitely a well concealed skill. Besides
                                            the user and the puppet, no one else would be able to see the purple-red
                                            eyes of his, and even the Heavenly Skill Image was well hidden on Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s back.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst everyone present, only Shangguan Fei’er, whose cultivation level was
                                            higher than Zhou Weiqing, could faintly sense a hint of Heavenly Energy
                                            reverberating in the air. As for the others, they did not sense anything at
                                            all.</p>
                                        <p>The quartermaster faltered momentarily, a purple red light flashing faintly
                                            in his eyes for a split second before disappearing. After staring slightly
                                            dazedly at Zhou Weiqing for a while, he seemed to recover and exclaimed with
                                            a sudden realisation. “Ahh, no wonder, so it is you! I remember now, it is
                                            truly a great addition for the Sixteenth Regiment to have your presence! You
                                            must be here to take charge of the heavy cavalry of the Sixteenth
                                            Regiment.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded proudly, lowering his head to the quartermaster’s ear,
                                            saying something softly before passing a plaque to him.</p>
                                        <p>The quartermaster lowered his head to take a look at it, before returning it
                                            respectfully to Zhou Weiqing, saying in a solemn voice: “I understand.
                                            Please rest outside here for now, I will arrange for the supplies to be
                                            gathered here for you immediately.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, he turned and headed back into the camp. Zhou Weiqing also
                                            returned to his Ghost Demon Horse, giving the order for the rest of his
                                            company to dismount and rest as well.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion soldiers did not know what Zhou Weiqing was up to, and
                                            they were all rather curious. Wasn’t their Battalion Commander a fresh
                                            recruit to the army? Why was it that he seemed to know this quartermaster?
                                            However, despite all the questions in their hearts, they did not dare open
                                            their mouth to ask! After all, as soon as they did so, their money would
                                            disappear!</p>
                                        <p>As such, they could only bottle their questions inside and wait silently.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing’s entire back was covered in cold sweat. This was
                                            after all the first time he was using the Demonic Dragon God Seal, and
                                            though it seemed like two people were speaking, it was actually him
                                            controlling.</p>
                                        <p>Although his spirit energy was considerably high, it was still a massive
                                            drain to split his spirit into two like that.</p>
                                        <p>The effect of the Demonic Dragon God Seal was indeed powerful, and even had a
                                            range of more than 500 li. Just like the Dragon Silencing Seal, there would
                                            only be one more time when it would evolve; that would be when Zhou Weiqing
                                            broke through to the Heavenly King Stage.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, who else could guess that everything happening now was everything
                                            under Zhou Weiqing’s control! As the quartermaster returned to the camp, the
                                            busy sounds from within soon rang out, the bustling noise of movement,
                                            wheels and other general din.</p>
                                        <p>In bringing this hundred heavy cavalry soldiers for the operation tonight, it
                                            had actually been Zhou Weiqing’s back up plan in case the quartermaster here
                                            had a cultivation level higher than the restriction of his Demonic Dragon
                                            God Seal. Luckily, it looked like this lesser plan would not be needed
                                            now.</p>
                                        <p>He beckoned towards the Company Leader at the gate, who quickly hurried
                                            forward.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander Sir, what instructions do you have?” Having heard that
                                            Zhou Weiqing was from the top elite Ghost Demon Horse Legion, his attitude
                                            was extremely respectful.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said passively: “Since your quartermaster has already started
                                            preparing the supplies, I will not wait here. I am heading back now, later
                                            tell your quartermaster to send it to the destination I told him.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he waved to his company, and they moved out swiftly.</p>
                                        <p>Due to the two rules that Zhou Weiqing had set earlier, the Peerless
                                            Battalion soldiers were forced to keep silent despite their curiosity,
                                            following behind Zhou Weiqing as they headed east for a distance before
                                            turning north.</p>
                                        <p>At last, Shangguan Fei’er could not hold back any longer. After all, she did
                                            not care about the gold coins. “Zhou Little Fatty, What have you got up your
                                            sleeve? You know that quartermaster just now?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, everything is settled. You just wait
                                            and see.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said with a dissatisfied look: “I don’t care whether or not
                                            everything is settled. You told me that this operation would be fun. What so
                                            fun about this!? I’m just accompanying you to chill in the northern
                                            winds?!”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at this Little Demon Girl, Zhou Weiqing felt a sense of helplessness.
                                            Trying to put a bluff past her was not that easy.</p>
                                        <p>Left without a choice, he could only say mysteriously: “Fei’er, let me tell
                                            you a secret. Actually, I do not know that quartermaster at all, and the
                                            plaque that I gave him was merely my Battalion Commander plaque, not any
                                            secret orders… and it should have no use… That is truly the fun part of
                                            tonight’s operation… why did he listen to me? Can you guess?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er started momentarily, then lapsed into thoughtful silence.
                                            She was an intelligent girl after all, yet she still did not fully
                                            understand what Zhou Weiqing had said. Previously, she had thought he
                                            recognized that quartermaster somehow, but since he said he did not… what
                                            was going on?</p>
                                        <p>Seeing her lapse into deep thought, Zhou Weiqing let loose a relieved breath.
                                            Leading the company almost fifty li ahead, he finally stopped at a slightly
                                            taller hill.</p>
                                        <p>“Everyone rest right here, conceal yourselves. This operation is almost over,
                                            so watch your mouths still, be warned of the fine.” Zhou Weiqing gave the
                                            order.</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, he sat down easily and unrestrained just like that, and
                                            started cultivating, as if his plan had been to come here all along. Of
                                            course, no one else knew that he was currently focusing all his spirit on
                                            controlling that quartermaster. Shangguan Fei’er and the others were nearby
                                            protecting him, and he could wake himself up at anytime, so he did not feel
                                            the need to be afraid of being interrupted.</p>
                                        <p>After almost an hour, a troop of almost five hundred men walked towards them
                                            stealthily. The leader was Wei Feng.</p>
                                        <p>When Wei Feng arrived, he was surprised to see that Zhou Weiqing and the
                                            others were already waiting for them at this prearranged spot. Halting for a
                                            confused second, he quickly moved forward to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander, what is the situation?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes and turned to Shangguan Fei’er before saying:
                                            “Fei’er, you bring the heavy cavalry troops back first. They are much too
                                            obvious. Leave the rest to us.”</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Shangguan Fei’er was still in the midst of contemplating how
                                            Zhou Weiqing had accomplished all that. Her mind had run through countless
                                            possibilities, which she had thrown out one by one. Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            words, she nodded slightly, mounting her Ghost Demon Horse and leading the
                                            heavy cavalry soldiers away, still deep in thought.</p>
                                        <p>After sending Shangguan Fei’er away, Zhou Weiqing turned to Wei Feng and
                                            smiled faintly, full of confidence. “Order everyone to conceal themselves as
                                            best they can. We just need to sit still and watch the upcoming good
                                            show.”</p>
                                        <p>Two hours later, it was already in the wee hours way past midnight. The
                                            bitter cold of the night caused the many Peerless Battalion soldiers to
                                            shiver incessantly. Although they were all Jewel Masters with good
                                            physiques, staying here in the open wilderness was still not a comfortable
                                            thing. If not for the fact that Zhou Weiqing had promised them much gain,
                                            and he had previously kept his promises, perhaps they would have mutinied by
                                            then.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, the sounds of carts could be faintly heard in the
                                            distance. On looking, they saw rows of carts being pulled slowly by
                                            soldiers, led by the quartermaster mounted on a fine steed, looking
                                            extremely valiant. However, if one actually examined his eyes closely, they
                                            were currently soulless and empty.</p>
                                        <p>They continued along until they were about five hundred metres from where
                                            Zhou Weiqing and the Peerless Battalion were, before the quartermaster
                                            raised his hands and they all stopped.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Wei Feng was staring with his eyes wide open. There were
                                            almost two hundred carts full of supplies, with some livestock behind as
                                            well; some pigs, cows and sheep. If not for Zhou Weiqing’s hand on his
                                            shoulder holding him back, perhaps Wei Feng would have already led the men
                                            to rob them all. After all, there were barely five hundred soldiers pulling
                                            the carts. In terms of fighting prowess, how could those logistic troops
                                            compare to the Peerless Battalion soldiers.</p>
