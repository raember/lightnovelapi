                                            start in-fighting amongst each other. The death count will be no lesser. Do
                                            you understand my meaning?"</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head sheepishly: "Not really."</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian suddenly laughed. "It's good that you don't. You are not made out
                                            to be a politician, ruler or conqueror. Some things are not good to learn
                                            too early. You can leave now, bring Tian'er along, otherwise even if she
                                            stays here, her heart is no longer here. Every three years, I want you and
                                            Tian'er to return here, I will examine both your cultivation progress."</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was overjoyed. "Thank you Lord Father in Law!"</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian smiled faintly and said: "I can see a possible miracle on you,
                                            something I never thought I would see in my life. However, I do not wish
                                            that this miracle be just a passing or transient flight like the flowering
                                            of the broad-leaved epiphyllum. In this world, there are many geniuses and
                                            talents, but in the end they amount to nothing. That is because of the word
                                            - 'Pride'."</p>
                                        <p>"With Fatty Long by your side, I do not have to worry too much about that. I
                                            also know that there is much pressure on you from all sides. However, for
                                            youths, no pressure means no motivation. I hope that you can let me continue
                                            seeing more miracles, until that day when I can no longer interfere in your
                                            business. Oh yes. One more thing, both of you are not allowed to appear on
                                            the borders of the WanShou Empire any longer. Otherwise, I will personally
                                            catch you back and smack your ass."</p>
                                        <p>"Uhh.." Zhou Weiqing looked at his father-in-law speechlessly, before finally
                                            running off dejectedly.</p>
                                        <p>After Zhou Weiqing had left, Xue AoTian finally sighed softly. His wife had
                                            left, and now his daughter was also leaving, and even his disciple was gone.
                                            A sudden loneliness overwhelmed him. He sat there silently for a while, and
                                            all of a sudden his head turned in thought, and he muttered to himself:
                                            “That little brat does have a point... perhaps it is time for me to go have
                                            a walk outside. However, that will still have to wait until I settle
                                            everything here in the WanShou Empire…”</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>The next morning, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er said their goodbyes to Xue AoTian,
                                            before following Long Shiya to leave the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya did not bring Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er in flying with him, instead
                                            letting Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er make their own way while he returned to the
                                            Peerless Battalion camp first. To quote Long Shiya: “It’s too much for me to
                                            move along with you young folks. You two are always so intimate and
                                            affectionate, provoking this poor old man who is still a virgin at the age
                                            of hundred. Ahhh the inhumanity!”</p>
                                        <p>And thus, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor fled the scene. As for Zhou
                                            Weiqing, he entered the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, flapping his massive
                                            wings as he carried Tian’er in a bridal-style, slowly flying across the
                                            skies towards the northern border.</p>
                                        <p>Soaring and tumbling in midair, Zhou Weiqing was definitely not in a rush to
                                            go back; after all the borders were already over by now. From his
                                            father-in-law's words, Zhou Weiqing knew that his Peerless Battalion was
                                            definitely fine, and had even caused quite some trouble for the WanShou
                                            Empire. Furthermore, Long Shiya would already be returning in advance. As
                                            such, he decided to take his time and put his focus on Tian'er as they made
                                            their return.</p>
                                        <p>In the past few months, he had spent every waking hour cultivating and
                                            training with all his might. Now, he needed some relaxation time, to spend
                                            some time with his beloved Tian'er.</p>
                                        <p>“Tian’er, what do you say… if we were to do ‘that’ high up in the skies,
                                            wouldn’t it be extra sensational?”</p>
                                        <p>“You… stop dreaming!”</p>
                                        <p>“Come on, let’s try it. It’ll be a unique experience.” A voice filled with
                                            temptation rang out in the air.</p>
                                        <p>“No, what if I fall down, I don’t know how to fly.”</p>
                                        <p>“No you won’t… even if I fall down, I will never let you fall!”</p>
                                        <p>“No…”</p>
                                        <p>“Tian’er, your little buttocks are so perky. But… you have really lost so
                                            much weight. Come, let me help you rub them, your meat will grow back
                                            then.”</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou Weiqing! You are truly a bad egg, rotten to the core!”</p>
                                        <p>“Tian’er, haven’t you heard of that line? “If a man is not bad, a woman will
                                            not love him; if a man isn’t a rogue, women will not go to bed with him. A
                                            good guy will always remain a virgin! Anyway… I was already forced by you
                                            last time, you must take full responsibility for me!”</p>
                                        <p>“Who forced you! You... Wuuuu….”</p>
                                        <p>A similar occurrence happened almost everyday. Luckily, they were flying high
                                            above almost thousand metres into the sky. In the entire trip back, the
                                            greatest reward that Zhou Weiqing had was that his flying technique grew by
                                            leaps and bounds.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>North Border. ZhongTian Northwest Main Army Camp. Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>“The Battalion Commander has been gone for so long, why isn’t he back
                                            yet!”</p>
                                        <p>In the large headquarter tent of the Peerless Battalion, all the officers
                                            were present. Hua Feng, Mu En, and the other Heavenly Bow Unit god archers,
                                            as well as the Chief Instructor Shangguan Fei'er, Vice Commander Wei Feng
                                            and the various Main Company Leaders.</p>
                                        <p>The current Peerless Battalion, not only did they have an exalted status in
                                            the Northwest Armies, it was even in the entire ZhongTian northern
                                            border.</p>
                                        <p>The site where the Peerless Battalion was camped at did not change, but now
                                            around the Peerless Battalion there were fully six Heavy Armoured Regiments
                                            encamped, four of which were Heavy Infantry Regiments and two Heavy Cavalry
                                            Regiments.</p>
                                        <p>The entire Northwest Army originally did not have that many Heavy Armoured
                                            Regiments, and some of them had actually been moved over from the other
                                            Northern Armies. Their only mission was to defend and support the Peerless
                                            Battalion!</p>
                                        <p>In this year's border wars, the Northwest Armies had met an unprecedented
                                            number and power of enemies; not just in terms of quantity but also quality.
                                            A whole seventeen Companies of the WanShou Empire! Not only that, it was
                                            including a powerful Mammoth Company and the invincible flying Eagle
                                            Company. Yet, it was also in this year's border wars that the Northwest
                                            Armies had achieved an unforeseen and hitherto unknown success.</p>
                                        <p>When the WanShou Empire armies had retreated, out of the seventeen Companies
                                            that had invaded them, only eight remained. And the only reason this had
                                            happened was because of this single new formation that the Northwest Armies
                                            had - the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>The strength of combat prowess of the Peerless Battalion had already been
                                            proven to the extreme in just the first battle they had attended. In fact,
                                            it was only because of their brutal strength which had allowed them to turn
                                            the tide of the battle, forcefully turning a sure-loss into a shocking
                                            victory. The first full force advance of the WanShou Empire had turned into
                                            a full rout, and the ZhongTian army had even been able to chase to further
                                            kill some more enemies. In the subsequent battles that happened, the
                                            Peerless Battalion had truly become the stabilizing force and pillar [1.
                                            定海神针 - Literally translated would be the Godly Needle that Calms the Oceans.
                                            Another name for the Gold Heavenly Cudgel that Sun Wukong wields in
                                            legend.]of the Northwest Army. The WanShou Empire armies had tried all sorts
                                            of means and different offensive strategies, but besides the Mammoth
                                            Company, no other Regiment was able to withstand the rain of powerful
                                            Consolidated arrows.</p>
                                        <p>Under the leadership of Hua Feng and the other leaders, the Peerless
                                            Battalion was truly able to make full use of all their advantages. Against
                                            the Mammoth Company, they would immediately move aside in avoidance.
                                            Although the other Regiments of the Northwest Army were no match for the
                                            Mammoth Company or the other Companies of the WanShou Empire, but they were
                                            able to risk their lives to hold off the Mammoth Company for some time. The
                                            Peerless Battalion would then seize the chance to attack the other weaker
                                            Companies of the WanShou Empire. Under the constant onslaught of their
                                            Consolidated Bows, the fatalities amongst the WanShou Empire was just too
                                            high, too quick. As a result, though their enemies had been the strongest,
                                            it had actually been the Northwest Border which had ended the annual border
                                            wars the soonest.</p>
                                        <p>Being the linchpin of such an amazing victory, with countless military
                                            exploits under their belt in such a short time, it was no wonder that even
                                            the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian quickly learned of their
                                            existence.</p>
                                        <p>According to their military exploits, it was no problem for the Peerless
                                            Battalion to be upgraded to an actual Regiment. Let alone the Northwest
                                            Armies, even the main North Central Army Headquarters had sent several
                                            envoys in hopes of taking over the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, with the background of the Heaven's Expanse Palace there, especially
                                            with Shangguan Fei'er's presence as a stunning deterrent, how could the
                                            Peerless Battalion be given to anyone? The original Ruffians that were
                                            looked down upon by all had suddenly become the admiration and envy of all
                                            the ZhongTian Northern armies. Countless of people dreamed of entering the
                                            Peerless Battalion, even some of those Regiment Commanders or Vice
                                            Commanders were no exception.</p>
                                        <p>The treatment of the Peerless Battalion was just too good. After discussion
                                            between all the officers, Hua Feng had decided to swap all their military
                                            exploits and awards for gold and other necessary supplies. As for the
                                            Peerless Battalion side, in the last few months they had continuously been
                                            upgrading their gear, continuing their training without halt. It could be
                                            said that every day was an improvement to the entire Peerless Battalion, no
                                            matter how small. The only thing that remained unchanged was their
                                            numbers.</p>
                                        <p>Seated at the head of the table, Hua Feng swept his gaze across all the
                                            officers gathered. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly with emotion. It could
                                            be said that when they had left their dying Empire behind originally, the
                                            seven members of the Heavenly Bow Unit had been filled with despair and
                                            hopelessness. They did not contain any hopes of ever succeeding in their
                                            task of reviving their Empire, even thoughts of revenge seemed far off. Yet,
                                            now their hearts were all filled with endless hope. The strength of the
                                            Peerless Battalion warmed their hearts, allowing them to see the possibility
                                            of actually reviving their homeland in this lifetime.</p>
                                        <p>“I’m sure he will be returning soon. Since the Battalion Commander was
                                            brought away by Senior Long, I'm sure he has been in closed door
                                            cultivation. He must be in a critical period of his cultivation, otherwise
                                            he wouldn't have left during such a period of war.” Hua Feng smiled faintly
                                            as he spoke.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei'er sat not far from Hua Feng, and as she heard his words she
                                            pursed her lips. From the looks of things, she was clearly not very happy
                                            about it.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng said: “Battalion Commander Hua Feng, the war has already ended for
                                            some time. Should we return to our original Peerless Battalion camp? If we
                                            continue staying here, I'm afraid the rest of the Northwest Armies might end
                                            up rebelling.” As he spoke up to that point, he couldn't help but laugh out
                                            loud.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng was not even joking or being alarmist at all. Ever since the
                                            Peerless Battalion had proven their terrifying strength in war, countless of
                                            people had been trying all means to join the Peerless Battalion. This
                                            included the six Heavy Armoured Regiments that were camped around them...
                                            most especially the Heavy Infantry Regiment that had actually fought
                                            together with them in the war.</p>
                                        <p>Only those who had actually fought together with the Peerless Battalion and
                                            seen them in action could truly know how strong they were. As soldiers, who
                                            did not wish to have such powerful friends and allies by their side? Who did
                                            not dream of being invincible on the battlefield? Gaining military exploits
                                            and awards seemed to be as easy as picking things up from the ground!</p>
                                        <p>However, such a situation was actually pointless to the Peerless Battalion.
                                            The Northwest Army Headquarter had actually sent several envoys in hopes
                                            that the Peerless Battalion would expand to become a Regiment, or even a
                                            Legion. They promised that their leaders and officers would remain
                                            unchanged, and they would give them some strong Regiments to form a Peerless
                                            Legion, to become the strongest Legion in the entire ZhongTian Army as a
                                            deterrent threat against the WanShou Empire.</p>
                                        <p>This suggestion was actually made by the main ZhongTian Army headquarters,
                                            not just the Northern border armies. However, Hua Feng and the others had
                                            suppressed it.</p>
                                        <p>Regarding this matter, the ZhongTian Army Headquarters had even gone all the
                                            way up to the ZhongTian Emperor, Shangguan Tianxin. When Shangguan Tianxin
                                            learned of the Peerless Battalion and their supposed background, he had
                                            personally taken a trip down to the Heaven's Expanse Palace. However, the
                                            final result was a shock to everyone. The Heaven's Expanse Palace had given
                                            the order that the final decision would be left to the Peerless Battalion's
                                            Commander - Zhou Weiqing. That was to say, if Zhou Weiqing was willing to
                                            set up the Legion, then they could go ahead. Otherwise, remaining as status
                                            quo would also be fine.</p>
