                                            exited the cabin.</p>
                                        <p>When the youth saw Shangguan Bing’er after she had put on a change of clean
                                            and simple clothes, his eyes nearly popped out and he found it hard to even
                                            walk.  It wasn’t until Zhou Weiqing let out a gentle cough that the youth
                                            was awoken from his awe.</p>
                                        <p>The youth hurriedly lowered his now-blushing face, leading the way rather
                                            embarrassedly.  Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but secretly laugh. The kid had
                                            to be a young virgin! Bing’er’s beauty was most effective at enticing young
                                            male virgins.</p>
                                        <p>When Shangguan Bing’er had first followed Zhou Weiqing all those years ago,
                                            she was already quite dazzling.  The only difference was that back then she
                                            had seemed a bit fresh and immature. As three years had gone by, she had
                                            fully blossomed into a truly peerless beauty.  Although the three Shangguan
                                            sisters were identical, their auras were completely different. Shangguan
                                            Bing’er had a soft, gentle quality to her beauty that was the most enticing
                                            of the three.  Right now, she was dressed in water-green robes and wearing
                                            no makeup. She looked like a young orchid, filled with grace and
                                            spirituality. Anyone who saw her would feel that her only ‘fault’ was that
                                            the only man in her eyes was Zhou Weiqing.  She didn’t seem to even notice
                                            the way the youth had stared at her just now.</p>
                                        <p>The youth guided Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er into the interior of the
                                            ship.  This ship was truly enormous, over three hundred meters long and
                                            eighty meters wide.  Ships of such enormous size were extremely uncommon in
                                            the Boundless Mainland, and they wouldn’t even rock when beset by great
                                            waves in a storm.  They were extremely stable vessels for venturing deep
                                            into the ocean. Although this ship couldn’t match the Sea Emperor Shuttle in
                                            speed, it could hold far more than just one or two people!</p>
                                        <p>The youth continued to guide them deeper into the ship until they finally
                                            reached an enormous cabin.  This cabin actually had a banquet prepared
                                            within it, and the dishes prepared were all rather foreign and exotic to
                                            Shangguan Bing’er and Zhou Weiqing.  Clearly, they weren’t from the
                                            Boundless Mainland.</p>
                                        <p>Grandmaster Guyu sat in the main seat, while a serious-faced man who looked
                                            to be in his forties sat next to him.  Zhou Weiqing didn’t see this man
                                            earlier during the day, but judging from his clothes he was probably an
                                            important member of the crew.  It was very possible that he was the captain
                                            of the ship.</p>
                                        <p>Three tables had been prepared in total.  Aside from the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters he had seen earlier, the others were probably all important members
                                            of the ship’s crew.</p>
                                        <p>Guyu beckoned towards Zhou Weiqing and Bing’er, indicating that they were to
                                            join him at his table.  Zhou Weiqing understood that it was time to put on a
                                            play. These people definitely wanted to figure out what their background
                                            was.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he entered, he had put a grateful look upon his face.  When it
                                            came to acting, Zhou Weiqing was without a doubt one of the top figures in
                                            all the Boundless Mainland.</p>
                                        <p>He pulled Bing’er over to Guyu’s table, then bowed respectfully.
                                             “Grandmaster.”</p>
                                        <p>Guyu nodded towards them, indicating that they should sit.  The two youths
                                            seated below Guyu had appeared earlier in the day, and they couldn’t help
                                            but stare at Shangguan Bing’er.  Although they didn’t exactly look
                                            ‘lascivious’, they were pretty close. After having changed her clothes,
                                            Shangguan Bing’er looked like an orchid hidden within a gorge.  She put all
                                            the other women on this entire vessel to shame.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er didn’t even seem to notice their gazes.  She simply lowered
                                            her head, moving slightly closer to Zhou Weiqing to indicate that every part
                                            of her belonged to him.</p>
                                        <p>Guyu’s gaze flickered across the two of them.  He then smiled and said, “We
                                            were in a bit of a rush when we saved you earlier.  Can I ask where you are
                                            from? Can you tell me a bit more about the disaster which befell you?  I’m
                                            responsible for this entire ship’s safety in this dangerous ocean, after
                                            all.” His words were quite restrained, but he had made it unmistakably clear
                                            that he wanted to know more about Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er’s
                                            backgrounds.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, a flicker of grief flashing through his eyes.  Even
                                            Shangguan Bing’er, who knew that he was just putting on a show, couldn’t
                                            help but feel moved by his incredibly realistic grief.  How could the others
                                            not do so as well?</p>
                                        <p>“Grandmaster, you and your friends rescued our lives.  Of course we have to
                                            tell you about ourselves! My humble wife and I came from a small clan
                                            located near W’Batu Harbor.  We were riding a great vessel when we went out
                                            to sea. Our clan fell long ago, leaving behind just myself and my humble
                                            wife.  We had been hoping to hunt some sea monsters on this trip and claim
                                            their Heavenly Cores to make some money and improve our luck.</p>
                                        <p>“We never would’ve imagined that we’d run into a Terror Sea Dragon, one of
                                            the rulers of the seas.  I’m not even sure what happened. All I heard was
                                            someone scream the words ‘Terror Sea Dragon’, and in the next instant our
                                            ship was completely destroyed.  We were fairly lucky, as we were swept away
                                            by the waves and sent drifting across the seas. If a few more days went by,
                                            we probably would’ve both died. Oh, right!  My name is Zhou Weiqing, while
                                            my humble wife is Shangguan Bing’er. We are tremendously grateful for having
                                            been rescued by everyone, and we’ll find a way to repay you for saving our
                                            lives.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing spoke with what could only be described as ‘absolute sincerity’.
                                             It was perfectly in keeping with his status as a disaster victim, and it
                                            also gave a clear explanation as to who he and his wife were.  As for W’Batu
                                            Harbor, it was one of the other destinations that had been marked within the
                                            Sea Emperor Shuttle’s maps. The only other name Zhou Weiqing knew was the
                                            ‘Xuantian Continent’ itself, and these people here obviously wouldn’t
                                            suspect that he was from the Boundless Mainland.  For him to simply report
                                            W’Batu to skip over this question was more than enough.</p>
                                        <p>When they saw the bitter look on his face and heard him narrate his tale,
                                            most of the people present revealed looks of pity.  The only one to be
                                            unmoved was Grandmaster Guyu. He said calmly, “In other words, you are
                                            independent cultivators? Judging by appearances, you are less than twenty
                                            years of age.  For an independent cultivator of your age to become a
                                            five-Jeweled expert couldn’t have been easy.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing let out a sigh.  Not seeming to have heard the suspicions
                                            underlying Guyu’s words, he explained, “Although my clan has fallen upon
                                            hard times, we’ve never lost our legacies and our cultivation techniques.
                                             Grandmaster, how about this? Since you saved our lives, if you wish I can
                                            hand over my clan’s cultivation techniques to you. This is just a small
                                            token of gratitude from the two of us.”</p>
                                        <p>If there was anyone else who still felt suspicious of him, their suspicions
                                            were now completely allayed by his words.  Everyone could sense his absolute
                                            sincerity.</p>
                                        <p>In both the Boundless Mainland and the Xuantian Continent, ancestral
                                            cultivation techniques were incredibly valuable to any and all Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters.  Zhou Weiqing expressing willingness to hand his over was
                                            more than enough to demonstrate his sincerity. Every single person’s
                                            cultivation technique was unique in its own way, and it could be used to
                                            judge many things.  For him to not even hold back on something as priceless
                                            as an ancestral technique meant that he was essentially laying himself
                                            completely bare.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, when Guyu heard these words his expression instantly became much
                                            friendlier.  He waved his hand and said, “When we have some spare time,
                                            let’s spar a little. For you to have reached the five-Jeweled level at such
                                            a young age means that you are a promising talent.  This old man is willing
                                            to give you a pointer or two.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s words were beautifully spoken, but Grandmaster Guyu wouldn’t
                                            be so easily convinced.  <em>If you wish to offer up your techniques, then
                                                I’ll first see for myself just how your techniques are</em>.  Besides,
                                            any technique which could allow a twenty-year-old to reach the five-Jeweled
                                            stage had to be a decent one.</p>
                                        <p>The hidden verbal exchange between the two was ‘invisible’, but it was the
                                            most dangerous of all confrontations.  If something went wrong, the two
                                            sides could instantly find themselves enemies. The reason why Zhou Weiqing
                                            was able to remain composed was because he truly didn’t have any intentions
                                            of harming the people aboard this vessel.  In addition, even if something
                                            did go wrong he didn’t have to be afraid. So long as he had the Sea Emperor
                                            Shuttle, they would still be able to reach the Xuantian Continent. However,
                                            if they reached the continent via this vessel they would have a new, proper
                                            identity.  They would also be able to learn many things regarding the
                                            continent, which would be of great use to them.</p>
                                        <p>The meals on the ship were naturally centered around seafood.  Large ships
                                            like this would only bring fruits, vegetables, and a small amount of dried
                                            meat and grains.  The vast majority of their provisions, they had to catch
                                            for themselves from the sea. This was the only way for them to continue to
                                            sail for extended periods of time.</p>
                                        <p>However, this rather plain banquet was more than enough to awaken the
                                            appetites of Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er.  Any sort of hot food would
                                            be unspeakably appealing after the month they had spent subsisting on
                                            grains! Their very voracity served as another testament to the terrible
                                            experience they had suffered at sea.</p>
                                        <p>After the meal, Grandmaster Guyu didn’t release Zhou Weiqing.  Instead, he
                                            invited Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er to his private quarters.</p>
                                        <p>Compared to Zhou Weiqing’s residence, Guyu’s cabin was much larger and better
                                            furnished.  This single cabin took up all the space in the ship’s highest
                                            level, and it even came with its own exercise area.  From here, they had a
                                            superb vantage point to see the ocean around them.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er waited outside, while Zhou Weiqing was ushered inside the
                                            cabin.  The two peculiar-looking youths were Guyu’s disciples, and they
                                            waited outside as well.  They tried to strike up a conversation with
                                            Shangguan Bing’er and get closer to her. If it had been Shangguan Fei’er who
                                            was here, all their secrets would’ve been revealed in a snap.  Bing’er,
                                            however, was different. No matter what they said, she simply listened with a
                                            smile while saying very little. This simply spurred them on, but they
                                            remained quite courteous and didn’t act improperly at all.</p>
                                        <p> Roughly an hour later, Grandmaster Guyu let out a startled cry from within
                                            his cabin.  “This cultivation technique of yours is absolutely suicidal! For
                                            you to have reached such a level is just incredibly lucky.  ‘Immortal Deity
                                            Technique’? More like ‘Doomed Deity Technique’!”</p>
                                        <p>The door to the cabin swung open.  Zhou Weiqing walked out with a rather
                                            helpless look on his face, Grandmaster Guyu by his side.  Guyu had an
                                            absolutely stunned look on his face, and he couldn’t help but stare at Zhou
                                            Weiqing strangely.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Shangguan Bing’er heard this, she knew what had happened.  She
                                            lowered her head and forced back her laughter as she walked over to stand
                                            next to Zhou Weiqing.  The cute and reliant way she acted towards him filled
                                            the two youths with jealousy.</p>
                                        <p>Guyu let out a long sigh.  “Weiqing, this old man has honestly never even
                                            heard of a technique like this, nor can I give you any pointers.  Go back to
                                            your cabin and have a rest. We’re already on our way back. If we run into
                                            any enemies enroute to the continent, I’ll need to ask the two of you to
                                            lend a hand.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said respectfully, “Of course.”  His earlier performance had
                                            clearly won him Guyu’s acknowledgment, and he was now a member of this
                                            vessel’s crew.</p>
                                        <p>Next came the long trip back.  To the people on the boat, this was an
                                            extremely boring trip.  All they did was occasionally hunt a few weaker sea
                                            beasts to add to their harvests.  To Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er,
                                            however, this was a far better life than the one they had experienced on the
                                            Sea Emperor Shuttle.  They didn’t need to do anything at all, but they were
                                            still headed where they needed to go. Most importantly, they were learning
                                            many new things about the Xuantian Continent.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was highly adaptable to any new environment, and he made friends
                                            very easily.  He quickly began to learn a great deal of information through
                                            his conversations with the people aboard this ship.</p>
