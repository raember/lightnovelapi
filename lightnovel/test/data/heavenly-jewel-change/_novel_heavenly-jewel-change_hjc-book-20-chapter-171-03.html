                                            all fully presented in his subconscious, every ebb and flow, reverberation,
                                            energy movement displayed before his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Abruptly, delight sparked in Zhou Weiqing's eyes as comprehension dawned upon
                                            him. He realised that if he did not fully grasp and master all those energy
                                            reverberations, even if he tried another hundred thousand more times,
                                            million times, he would never succeed.</p>
                                        <p>Even within the same group, the three Elemental Jewels had extremely
                                            different energy signatures and reverberations, almost drastically
                                            different.</p>
                                        <p>As he slowly began to understand the sheer magnitude of the task before him,
                                            Zhou Weiqing did not immediately try to gain control. Instead, he did not
                                            move at all, allowing himself to stay in that strange, miraculous state,
                                            observing every single change in all the six Elemental Jewels. Every tiny
                                            miniscule change, any ebb or flow, slightest movement or change… all of it
                                            imprinted into his mind.</p>
                                        <p>At the side, Long Shiya was a little surprised to see Zhou Weiqing freeze
                                            like that. Naturally, he knew it was a very troublesome process while
                                            merging the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formations. However, sensing the
                                            energy fields and signatures of the various Elemental Jewels was not
                                            something that could be simply taught or spoken about.</p>
                                        <p>This was something that had to be discovered by oneself, to stumble in the
                                            dark and grasp it. If he told Zhou Weiqing about it beforehand, he would
                                            definitely intentionally be seeking it, and the likely result would be that
                                            he would never be able to find it. He could only hope that with Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s intelligence and power of understanding, he would be able to
                                            understand it eventually.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, when he clearly saw Zhou Weiqing’s originally urgent and impatient
                                            eyes calmed down abruptly, and the six Elemental Jewels floating in front of
                                            him settled down in stillness. Not only then, within those deep purple eyes
                                            of Zhou Weiqing’s, a brilliant light shone, and Long Shiya could sense a
                                            powerful spiritual energy reverberation from his body… despite the fact that
                                            Zhou Weiqing did not have the Spirit Attribute. Such a powerful spiritual
                                            energy reverberation was far beyond any Upper Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master.</p>
                                        <p>“This is… power from the Solidified Dragon Spirit?! Or… perhaps that strange
                                            tiger bloodline he has…?” Even Long Shiya was left puzzled. In truth, one
                                            could say that no matter a Dragon or the Dark Demon God Tiger, both had
                                            extremely powerful spiritual energy. When both their bloodlines were fused
                                            together, there was a qualitative change, causing their spiritual energy to
                                            become even stronger. As Zhou Weiqing focused his full attention, it also
                                            slowly brought up this powerful spiritual energy for his use, otherwise his
                                            senses could not have boosted to such a degree in an instant.</p>
                                        <p>A faint smile. A faint smile revealed upon Zhou Weiqing’s face, as the two
                                            triangles in front of him slowly started to show change.</p>
                                        <p>Lightning, Darkness, Demonic. The three Elemental Jewels shone with a gentle
                                            light. Slowly, the triangle started spinning, the individual light which
                                            each gave forth growing stronger as time passed.</p>
                                        <p>What followed next was the triangle with the Wind, Spatial and Time
                                            Attributes, also starting to spin, but in a different direction.</p>
                                        <p>From just the outlook alone, with the two triangles both spinning, it would
                                            be even more difficult to merge together. However, Long Shiya watching
                                            calmly at the side knew fully that Zhou Weiqing was allowing the two
                                            triangles to maintain a temporary balance before bringing them to the actual
                                            fusion. In this way, as long as the two moving energy frequencies reached a
                                            compatible state, they could be fused together, and not like previously
                                            attempting to match six energy signatures.</p>
                                        <p>As the two triangles moved closer to one another, six different colours
                                            started flashing in the center, in erratic fluctuations. At this moment,
                                            Zhou Weiqing once again stopped the two triangles. This was not a time to
                                            advance too quickly and impulsively, otherwise he would fail on the last
                                            moment again.</p>
                                        <p>The reason he stopped the two triangles was simple - to wait for resonance
                                            between the two. Perhaps, it would be a long wait, but this was after all a
                                            resonance between two. It was a simple matter of probability, waiting for it
                                            to happen between two energy signatures was definitely a greater chance than
                                            between six energy signatures!</p>
                                        <p>Time passed, seconds… then minutes… Zhou Weiqing’s forehead was now beaded
                                            with fine drops of sweat. To maintain the six Elemental Jewels in such a
                                            manner was a huge toll on his Heavenly Energy and Spiritual Energy. Even
                                            though the wings behind his back was drawing in Heavenly Energy from the
                                            atmosphere, it was still far from being sufficient to replenish the massive
                                            drain.</p>
                                        <p>15 minutes… half hour… one hour...</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing still maintained in the exact same position, not having even
                                            moved a muscle as he maintained full control on the two triangles, keeping
                                            them both in the same position as they spun away. The only visible change
                                            was the gathering sweat on his forehead was clearly much more than
                                            before.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s vision was starting to blur, the two spinning triangles
                                            seeming to turn almost illusory, unreal. Maintaining full concentration and
                                            focus for such a long period of time, no matter how strong his spiritual
                                            energy was, there was still a limit.</p>
                                        <p><i>This is it, I’m at my limit… I can’t hold on any longer.</i> No matter
                                            Heavenly Energy or Spiritual Energy, Zhou Weiqing was already nearing the
                                            limit. However, he was at the awkward position that he could not allow
                                            himself to breakdown now, as his six Elemental Jewels were separated from
                                            his body. If he did not withdraw them back before breaking down, then he was
                                            in danger of losing his Power Jewels permanently. If that really happened;
                                            even the best case scenario would be him being crippled for life.</p>
                                        <p><i>I guess this is it. I’ll rest a while and try again.</i> Zhou Weiqing
                                            sighed deeply inwardly. Just as he was prepared to withdraw his six
                                            Elemental Jewels with a fluctuation of his will, all of a sudden the two
                                            triangles shuddered momentarily. In that moment, Zhou Weiqing sensed that
                                            the two triangles had suddenly miraculously entered a state of perfect
                                            resonance.</p>
                                        <p>Not a hint of warning, happiness just came too quickly. Of course, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had prepared for this for so long; how could he possibly give up
                                            this long-awaited chance.</p>
                                        <p>His spiritual energy exerting at maximum in that instant, and the two
                                            triangles came together at once, accompanied by a loud explosion, all six
                                            Elemental Jewels glowing brightly as they burst forth with energy. The
                                            original two triangles suddenly became a full star-shaped hexagon as they
                                            merged together, and the six different coloured lights rose forth, a
                                            powerful Heavenly Energy reverberation resonating through the entire
                                            air.</p>
                                        <p>Instantly, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that the last bits of remaining
                                            Heavenly Energy in his body being drained at a crazy rate by the six glowing
                                            lights, his entire body felt like it was being sucked dry. At this critical
                                            moment, an unbelievably pure Heavenly Energy surged into his body through
                                            his back, replenishing his almost fully-drained reserves at the last second.
                                            At the same time, the six lights in front of him shone brilliantly, and they
                                            clearly changed.</p>
                                        <p>Success! At that point, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense the harmony between
                                            all six Attributes. No matter how exhausted he was physically, mentally and
                                            spiritually; he would not give up such a perfect opportunity. Hiw own
                                            personal Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation had finally been formed,
                                            and this was his chance to fully explore its entire structure, energy
                                            signature and multitude of changes within. He did not dare to waste anytime
                                            celebrating; once again putting his full focus in controlling his spiritual
                                            energy. The six lights slowly lowered down to his feet, and Zhou Weiqing sat
                                            down right at the side of the newly raised formation, closing his eyes as he
                                            extended all his senses to their maximum to explore the formation and the
                                            energy reverberations around.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing’s Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation did not
                                            have the same bright brilliance that Long Shiya’s one did; and it was also
                                            currently unable to unleash the same insane power that Long Shiya could,
                                            able to mimic Heavenly God Tier Skills. However, he had finally taken his
                                            first step in this major breakthrough. It could be said that he had finally
                                            entered the realm of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts and achieved
                                            some small measure of success.</p>
                                        <p>A faint smile crossed his lips, his face glowing as he placed his hands on
                                            his knees, still fully concentrating on the six Attribute Heavenly Energy
                                            reverberations in front of him.</p>
                                        <p>At present, Long Shiya was standing right behind Zhou Weiqing. Indeed, at
                                            that previous moment of near-failure, that infusion of pure Heavenly Energy
                                            had been from this Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor. Currently, he was standing
                                            there, a clear look of delight on his face. It had only been a few days, and
                                            his disciple had already succeeded! More so, that Little Fatty’s Six
                                            Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation was totally different from his own,
                                            and Long Shiya was truly excited to see what sort of differences would occur
                                            from that.</p>
                                        <p>After all, Long Shiya had been researching these arts for so many years, and
                                            he could clearly sense that this newly created Six Ultimate Skill
                                            Manipulation Formation by Zhou Weiqing was truly a miraculous feat in its
                                            own right, and would have its own unique capabilities compared to his own.
                                            As for what those changes were, he would have to wait for Zhou Weiqing to
                                            awaken from his own explorations to find out.</p>
                                        <p>Slowly pulling back his hands from Zhou Weiqing’s back, Long Shiya stopped
                                            the infusion of Heavenly Energy to Zhou Weiqing. At this moment, he no
                                            longer needed the extra infusion; the fusion had been complete and the wings
                                            behind his back from the Dragon-Tiger Transformation was sufficient to
                                            sustain his energy expenditure.</p>
                                        <p>There was still some time before their deadline of the Winter Solstice [1. I
                                            previously translated this literally as ‘coldest day of winter’, after some
                                            reading I think this should be referring to the Winter Solstice, though
                                            technically that is the ‘shortest day’ or ‘longest night’ of winter. In any
                                            case I’ll use it from now on when that term is used. Haven’t been reading
                                            comments in the past few chapters so I’m not sure if anyone already
                                            mentioned this previously], and Zhou Weiqing’s training speed and
                                            achievements had already far surpassed Long Shiya’s previous expectations.
                                            From the looks of things, they would be able to prepare more before they
                                            ascended the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>Thinking about it with much satisfaction, Long Shiya’s gaze subconsciously
                                            turned towards the direction of the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>The normally cold and cheerless, almost desolate Heavenly Snow Mountain, had
                                            suddenly turned lively, bustling with noise and excitement. The reason was
                                            simple, the ‘True God’ of the entire northern ice plains, the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain Lord, had announced that his daughter was about to be married.
                                            Furthermore, the person she was about to be married to was the heir of the
                                            throne of the Royal Family of the WanShou Empire, the Heavenly Divine Earth
                                            Spirit Lions, and he could possibly even be the heir to the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain Lord position as well… the Lion Prince Gu Yingbing. Not long ago,
                                            Gu Yingbing had actually officially announced that he would be stepping down
                                            from the position of heir to the Royal Family, to focus on cultivation and
                                            training in the Heavenly Snow Mountains.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, this news did not cause Gu Yingbing’s status in the WanShou Empire
                                            to drop by any means, instead rising in stock drastically. The entire
                                            WanShou Empire knew of Gu Yingbing, and how talented and outstanding he was.
                                            Although he did not succeed in breaking through the Heavenly King Stage
                                            before the age of thirty, he was still one of the top in the entire younger
                                            generation, a leader in his own right amongst his peers. Just not long ago,
                                            he had broken through to the nine-Jeweled stage at the extremely young age
                                            of thirty two, becoming a Upper Stage Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, just
                                            a step away from reaching the Heavenly King Stage.</p>
                                        <p>As the saying went, breaking through to the Heavenly King Stage before the
                                            age of thirty would give one the chance to actually reach the Heavenly God
                                            Stage, but that was not an absolute thing. The main thing was that the early
                                            one broke through to the Heavenly King Stage, the greater the chance one
                                            would actually have to actually reach the Heavenly God Stage, however low
                                            that was still.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, Gu YingBing was the main disciple of the Heavenly Snow Mountain
                                            Lord, with all the resources of the entire north at his disposal. Who could
                                            say that Gu Yingbing would not reach the same height as the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain Lord, to ascend to the Heavenly God Stage in the future?</p>
                                        <p></p>
