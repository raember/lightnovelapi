                                        <p>Both sides were already extremely close by this point, and this abrupt change
                                            happened too suddenly for the two to react. Ao Le had already thought they
                                            had the victory in their grasp, and was in the midst of ‘acting cool’ when
                                            the sudden change occurred. As such, he did not have any time to react
                                            before Zhou Weiqing appeared right in front of him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s other hand was pointed at Liu Yinan, striking out thrice.
                                            Three Skills flashed out at her; the Fetters of Wind, Touch of Darkness and
                                            Spatial Shackles.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, unleashing these three powerful Control Skills at once was
                                            a huge drain on Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy. However, at this moment, he
                                            could not take any risk, the risk of Liu Yinan who was so close by having
                                            the possibility of disrupting his perfect plan.</p>
                                        <p>The Fetters of Wind and Touch of Darkness tightened around the five-Jeweled
                                            Liu Yinan instantly. She was after all not six-Jeweled like her husband, and
                                            the gap between her and Zhou Weiqing wasn’t as large, and it would
                                            definitely take her a longer time to break free of his Control. Finally, the
                                            Spatial Shackles snapped into place as a silver shield shimmered into place
                                            around her, at the same time breaking the handhold between her and Ao Le,
                                            forcing them apart.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time as he unleashed the Skills upon Liu Yinan, Zhou Weiqing also
                                            gave a vicious kick towards Ao Le’s chest with his right foot.</p>
                                        <p>Everything happened just too abruptly, and Ao Le was caught totally by
                                            surprise. When a person met with something that was totally out of his
                                            imagination, he would definitely be stunned momentarily, no matter how high
                                            his cultivation level was. As such, despite their disparity in power levels,
                                            he only had the time to move his hands up to protect his chest, channeling
                                            as much Heavenly Energy as he could to protect himself from Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            kick.</p>
                                        <p>Everything Zhou Weiqing had done up to this point could be said to be in
                                            preparation for this very move. Even the extent of how he had been affected
                                            by the Slow Barrier, as well as how it affected his archery, all of it was
                                            real, but also targeted to numb his opponents and to let them think he was
                                            totally helpless against their Slow Barrier and give him the opportunity to
                                            have this one decisive strike. Now that his plans had come together to this
                                            moment of fruition, how could he possibly let Ao Le have a chance to
                                            react?</p>
                                        <p>Power and strength was definitely extremely important in a fight, but
                                            intelligence could always be another deciding factor indeed.</p>
                                        <p>A massive explosion, as Zhou Weiqing’s right foot slammed hard into the
                                            intersection of Ao Le’s arms at the center of his chest. *Crackkk* Along
                                            with the explosion, the sickening sound of Ao Le’s right arm being broken
                                            could be heard, and he flew backwards from the sheer impact and inertia, as
                                            a mouthful of blood sprayed out involuntarily.</p>
                                        <p>This was also after considering the fact that the Heavenly Energy difference
                                            between the two was just too huge, with Ao Le’s cultivation level far above
                                            Zhou Weiqing, allowing him to dissipate a large portion of the impacting
                                            force. After all, the sheer power and brute strength of Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            Demonic Right Leg was absolutely terrifying, able to shake even Lin TianAo’s
                                            Five-Jeweled Assembly Shield Set.</p>
                                        <p>Knocking Ao Le back did not put a gap between the two. That was because under
                                            the effects of the Demonic Change State, Zhou Weiqing’s right leg had
                                            transformed into the scorpion hook, which he had managed to hook onto Ao
                                            Le’s arm, and his entire body followed suit along with Ao Le.</p>
                                        <p>The sharp pain in his arm, the absolute agony of his sternum being broken,
                                            combined to cause Ao Le’s eyes to turn bloodshot. At the same time, he
                                            sensed a bone chilling energy invade his body from Zhou Weiqing’s right
                                            foot, causing him to shudder violently. In a fluster, he quickly gathered
                                            all his remaining energy to unleash his strongest Skills and Consolidated
                                            Equipment. At this point, he could no longer afford to hold back at all, and
                                            all that was left in his heart was the desire to rip Zhou Weiqing into
                                            shreds.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, at this point, a strange warped light seemed to spread out from Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s right leg. Instantly, not just the Skills and Equipment that Ao Le
                                            was about to unleash, but also the source of cold invading his body was
                                            interrupted.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing vaulted backwards in the air, retreating instantly, while Ao Le
                                            landed hard on the ground with a loud thud.</p>
                                        <p>Blue. Black. Grey. Three lights swirled around his broken right arm for a
                                            moment, before vanishing. Ao Le wanted to leap to his feet, but he suddenly
                                            lost control of his body as it trembled uncontrollably. Once again, he was
                                            chilled to the bone, but this time it seemed to come from within, as his
                                            entire body convulsed, and lost in the spasms, his original thought of
                                            jumping up to strike at Zhou Weiqing was lost, and he could barely use the
                                            original Heavenly Energy for his offensive Skill and guide it to protect his
                                            heart. At the same time, he had to focus all his might in gathering all his
                                            Heavenly Energy in an attempt to drive out that terrifying cold from his
                                            body.</p>
                                        <p>“Ao Le!” Liu Yinan finally broke free of Zhou Weiqing’s three Control Skills.
                                            She could not even care about striking out at Zhou Weiqing, quickly leaping
                                            to Ao Le’s side to support his unsteady, shaking body.</p>
                                        <p>Landing at a distance from them, Zhou Weiqing was totally pale and shaking as
                                            well, but he still maintained himself in the Demonic Change State, though he
                                            half-knelt on the ground, panting heavily as he tried to gather himself once
                                            more. In just that short span of time, he had expanded more than seventy
                                            percent of all his Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, having an Elemental Jewel with six Attributes provided him
                                            with much power, with a large amount of great Skill Selections to use. Alas,
                                            his Heavenly Energy was just not sufficient to unleash all of these Skills
                                            without repercussions, especially since some of those Skills he had just
                                            used were extremely energy consuming.</p>
                                        <p>“How did you do that? I do not believe that you can dodge past my
                                            Interlocking Time Skill!” Ao Le stood up straight with Liu Yinan’s help, but
                                            instead of tending to his injuries, he asked Zhou Weiqing urgently.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned, saying: “Heh… it was an unexpected surprise right? You
                                            are right, your Interlocking Time Skill is indeed extremely powerful, and
                                            isn’t something that I can withstand. Even under the Demonic Change State,
                                            if I was under effects any longer, I would have probably died. Alas, you
                                            were just too overconfident in your own Skills. The Interlocking Time Skill
                                            is not perfect, or unbreakable. To be more accurate, every skill, under a
                                            particular circumstance, has a chance of being broken or resolved. What I
                                            used was the Time Disorder Skill… so you can rest assured it is definitely a
                                            Skill worthy of your loss.”</p>
                                        <p>Ao Le’s eyes widened; even his pupils dilated with shock. This time, even Liu
                                            Yinan couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise: “Time Disorder?! You… you
                                            actually have the Time Attribute as well?! But… but… why do you not have the
                                            specific yellow colour light of the Time Attribute?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged, saying: “I do not know about that… The Time Disorder
                                            Skill, with my low cultivation level, only has a mere one second effect, but
                                            that one second was more than enough to disrupt Bro Ao Le’s Interlocking
                                            Time Skill, and also temporarily disabling your Slow Barrier. That allowed
                                            me to escape their area of effects just in time to launch my attack. You
                                            were too confident, and too careless, and so I succeeded.”</p>
                                        <p>Liu Yinan gave a cold laugh: “Hmph, do you think that just by breaking Ao
                                            Le’s arm, you can beat us?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, saying: “Look carefully at your husband.
                                            Indeed, you can definitely beat me alone now at the state that I’m in, and
                                            force me to leave the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. However, if you do that,
                                            I’m afraid that Bro Ao Le’s life will be lost.”</p>
                                        <p>Surprised by his words, Liu Yinan quickly turned to examine Ao Le. She
                                            immediately discovered that perhaps Zhou Weiqing might not be lying.
                                            Unknowingly, Ao Le’s face was ashen grey, his body trembling violently.
                                            Although he was still awake, his teeth were gritted as he tried to contain
                                            the pain, and he could not even speak.</p>
                                        <p>Earlier, when Zhou Weiqing had kicked Ao Le and followed him as he flew back,
                                            he had unleashed his strongest offensive Skill in his arsenal in midair -
                                            the Dark Demon God Lightning!</p>
                                        <p>At such a close range, if Zhou Weiqing had unleashed the full power of the
                                            Dark Demon God Lightning on Ao Le, it would be without a doubt that Ao Le
                                            would perish. However, if that happened, Zhou Weiqing would be too weak, and
                                            Liu Yinan would definitely go crazy in trying to take revenge on him.
                                            Without considering Fat Cat’s intervention, he might be killed or forced to
                                            escape via the Lustre Gem.</p>
                                        <p>Even if he could escape the Lustre Spatial Realm, the Fei Li Battle Team had
                                            already made too enemies this Tournament. The Bai Da Empire, Dan Dun Empire,
                                            both of whom had fresh enmity towards them. If they added another BaoPo
                                            Empire, it would definitely not be a good sign. No matter what, Zhou Weiqing
                                            would definitely not kill off Ao Le, even if it might cost him the
                                            Tournament.</p>
                                        <p>In the time that the Dark Demon God Lightning was unleashed, the triple
                                            Attribute venom was forced out from Zhou Weiqing’s right foot into Ao Le’s
                                            body. Although it wasn’t as powerful as the direct strike from the Dark
                                            Demon God Lightning, the strong venom still caused him a large amount of
                                            pain.</p>
                                        <p>The next moment after unleashing the Dark Demon God Lightning, Zhou Weiqing
                                            used his other new Stored Skill, also of the Time Attribute, called: Time
                                            Interrupt.</p>
                                        <p>That was a Skill that Zhou Weiqing had Stored from a Heavenly King Stage
                                            Heavenly Beast. At that time when he was attempting to Store it, even with
                                            Fat Cat’s help, he had tried a total of twenty six times before finally
                                            succeeding. Even without active resistance from the Heavenly Beast, his
                                            Skill Storing had still failed so many times… one could just imagine how
                                            insanely powerful that Heavenly Beast was.</p>
                                        <p>The reason for the successive failures was just exactly this Personal Skill
                                            of this Heavenly King Stage Beast, the Time Interrupt.</p>
                                        <p>The Time Interrupt Skill was an area of effect Skill, and according to the
                                            records of the Skill Storing Palace, if a Heavenly King Stage Master
                                            activated this Skill, within a hundred yards radius, all Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters who were activating Skills or Consolidated Equipment would have them
                                            disrupted, or any channeling Skills would be interrupted as well.</p>
                                        <p>The difference from the Heavenly Lightning Shock was that Consolidated
                                            Equipment which had already been summoned would not vanish, but Skills which
                                            were already in effect would be disrupted.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, this was another powerful Control Skill, but Zhou Weiqing
                                            had to think for a long time before finally deciding to Store it.</p>
                                        <p>The Skill he had used earlier to disrupt Ao Le’s Interlocking Time, the Time
                                            Disorder Skill, was a life-saving type support skill, and this Time
                                            Interrupt was a powerful Crowd Control Skill. Its only shortcoming was that
                                            when it was unleashed, it would not differentiate between friend and foe,
                                            and everything and anyone caught within its area of effect would be affected
                                            by it. The most powerful and overbearing thing about it was actually its
                                            success conditions - it actually had an Absolute Success Rate as long as the
                                            person in question was within three levels of the user. Anyone of more than
                                            three levels higher than the user would have its effects reduced
                                            accordingly. Perhaps this Skill was too powerful, and its cooldown was an
                                            astonishing one hour!</p>
                                        <p>With Zhou Weiqing’s mere three-Jeweled cultivation level, when he used the
                                            Skill it would only be a three yard radius with him at the center, pretty
                                            much only of use at close range.</p>
                                        <p>However, at that point, he was right beside Ao Le,almost joined to him by the
                                            scorpion hook, and naturally the effect of the Skill was at its maximum.</p>
                                        <p></p>
