                                            purple figure of Zhou Little Fatty and his attacks were much more terrifying
                                            that he had expected. That was not a power that a six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master could have.</p>
                                        <p>A Zhou Little Fatty who had lost consciousness could only use the most basic
                                            attacks, both his hands extended out in a claw shape, almost like a dragon’s
                                            claws, glowing with a chilling purple light. Every time he attacks, it
                                            contained a powerful piercing effect. The scariest was the purple hook that
                                            his right leg had warped into, and it was the blows from it that actually
                                            managed to shake the six coloured shield of light that Long Shiya had
                                            summoned, even causing a tiny crack.</p>
                                        <p><i>Have I helped to raise up a true monster now? That strength… that is
                                            unbelievable indeed. </i></p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya couldn’t help but think to himself.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing was fully consumed by a primeval instinct, a wild and
                                            raw craziness that showed his consciousness was not awakened, and now that
                                            was the final process he had to go through. Long Shiya sighed inwardly, his
                                            right hand jabbing at Little Witch several times lightly, sending her into
                                            the shield of light. At the same time, he used a powerful Fetters of Wind to
                                            temporarily bind Zhou Weiqing’s body.</p>
                                        <p>When she saw that purple figure pouncing at her, Little Witch closed her
                                            eyes. In that instant, her heart had died. She knew that there was no more
                                            chance of her escaping.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, she was astonished to suddenly discover she had
                                            recovered her ability to move. However, all her Heavenly Energy had been
                                            sealed away.</p>
                                        <p>A wild and incandescent aura overwhelmed her, provoking her entire body to
                                            shudder, and she subconsciously opened her eyes.</p>
                                        <p>The first thing that entered her eyes, causing her heart to tremble violently
                                            in fear, was a pair of wild and invasive purple orbs. The deep purple gave
                                            one an impression that these orbs came from hell itself, giving forth an
                                            irresistibly scorching heat, as if the gaze was about to melt her body.</p>
                                        <p>On his face, there was a layer of fine scales, yet they did not protrude out,
                                            and alongside the pair of wild purple orbs that were his eyes, it seemed to
                                            have a strange attraction or glamour.</p>
                                        <p>His upper body was totally naked, with not even hair or fur on his body. His
                                            powerful body gleamed, the lines of his muscles well defined, full of power
                                            and beauty as he glowed in that eerie purple light, as if he was perfectly
                                            sculpted from a unique gemstone.</p>
                                        <p>Such a strange looking person, and it could be said that Little Witch had
                                            never seen or heard of such a person. Yet, as she looked upon his
                                            countenance, there was a strong sense of strange familiarity.</p>
                                        <p>“I’m really sorry, little girl, I have no choice but to use you as a
                                            sacrifice to awaken his consciousness. However, do not worry, I will ensure
                                            you are safe from harm.” At the side, Long Shiya waved his arm, and the
                                            six-coloured shield of light brought both Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch onto
                                            a small plateau of level ground.</p>
                                        <p>Although Long Shiya was very open minded and liberal, he would not possibly
                                            just watch his disciple do ‘that’.</p>
                                        <p>It was no surprise that Little Witch did not recognize Zhou Weiqing.
                                            Currently, he looked just too unbelievably different from previously, not
                                            just the purple hue around him, even his figure and stature was larger and
                                            more muscular than the previous time Little Witch had seen him, and he
                                            definitely looked more mature as well. More importantly, the tattoos and
                                            scales on his body from the two powerful bloodline powers had changed his
                                            looks in many small but myriad ways.</p>
                                        <p>All these changes added together, coupled with the terror in Little Witch’s
                                            heart, naturally she was not able to recognize him with a single look. In
                                            truth, having that small sense of familiarity was already rather impressive,
                                            after all Zhou Weiqing’s aura was extremely different from his previous one
                                            as well.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Long Shiya say the word ‘Sacrifice’, Little Witch almost fainted. As
                                            a member of the Heavenly Demon Sect, how could she not know what that
                                            entailed? Originally, the Demonic Attribute was so ostracized because of
                                            such an issue in Awakening the Attribute, often causing a huge change in
                                            character for the Demonic Jewel Master in question.</p>
                                        <p><i>This is it...it’s really over for me… </i>Seeing Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            magnificently robust body, and the dragon claws that seemed to threaten to
                                            tear her apart at anytime… as well as that large and thick, ferocious
                                            looking ‘weapon’ at the ‘particular place’, Little Witch’s mind blanked out.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, Long Shiya released his restriction on Zhou Weiqing.
                                            The scent of a female instantly filled Zhou Weiqing’s nose. Currently, he
                                            was controlled only by his base instincts, and almost subconsciously he
                                            pounced upon Little Witch, bringing her to the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch did not even struggle; she knew that it would be futile, and
                                            only bring her more pain or injury. Perhaps more accurately speaking would
                                            be that she was currently in a totally stunned and muddled state, filled
                                            with an unprecedented sense of weakness, helplessness, humiliation and pain,
                                            and if given a choice she would rather die now. However, though she had
                                            regained her ability to move, but under Long Shiya’s control, she had no
                                            strength left; even if she wanted to take her own life, she was not able to
                                            do so.</p>
                                        <p>Heat. Scorching heat. As Zhou Weiqing embraced Little Witch’s body, the first
                                            thing she felt was an intense heat emanating from his body, as if she would
                                            be instantly melted. Yet, there was no pain, instead the wild ferocity and
                                            strange aura from him caused her blanked out mind to suddenly have a strange
                                            feeling.</p>
                                        <p>The scent from Zhou Weiqing’s body was not unpleasant, instead having a
                                            strange attraction, a faint fragrance even, a sort of elegance that clashed
                                            with the aura he was giving off. Even so, after smelling it, Little Witch
                                            felt as if her entire blood vessels were ignited, the heat rising from
                                            within her body.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, when Zhou Weiqing had first Awakened his Power Jewels, entering
                                            the Demonic Change State for the first time, he had used Shangguan Bing’er
                                            as his Sacrifice, becoming a Heavenly Jewel Master that day. At that time, a
                                            black mist had emanated from his mouth, filled with a type of aphrodisiac of
                                            sorts, causing Shangguan Bing’er to lose herself. At this point, he now held
                                            both the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline and the Dragon bloodline fused
                                            together, and no matter each of these powerful Heavenly Beasts had been
                                            lustful creatures. Fused together, how could their auras be any lesser? This
                                            was perhaps even stronger than any of the most powerful natural medicines,
                                            especially since Little Witch was still a poor little innocent girl. In her
                                            current state of mind, being inflicted by such a strong stimulation, how
                                            could she possibly fight against this?</p>
                                        <p>A loud tearing sound. The dragon claws which Zhou Weiqing’s hands had turned
                                            into did not vanish, but strangely they were currently flying about at an
                                            unbelievable speed, but at such accuracy and unerring movement that did not
                                            touch Little Witch’s skin at all. However, within a few moments, the two
                                            were both naked.</p>
                                        <p>A low howl and soft cries and moans, intertwining into the most base and
                                            stirring of melodies. As compared to the first time he needed a Sacrifice,
                                            it was without a question that even cultivation level aside, Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            body and physique was far stronger and superior now. However, at the same
                                            time, Little Witch was almost at the seven-Jeweled cultivation level, and
                                            her body and endurance was also much superior to Shangguan Bing’er at that
                                            time. Furthermore, she had the Life Attribute, and her own recovery rate was
                                            far superior due to that.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch only managed to keep her wits about her for a few moments before
                                            finally falling to the onslaught, unable to resist that strange scent aura
                                            from Zhou Weiqing. The massive wings behind his back spread out fully,
                                            wrapping around the entwined duo. As they merged together, Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            hands and legs slowly returned to their original state, as if even in his
                                            unconscious state, he was still able to maintain some level of
                                            tenderness.</p>
                                        <p>Long Big Fatty sat at the entrance to the volcano. Naturally, though he did
                                            not eavesdrop, he could stay too far away, as he needed to monitor the
                                            changes in Zhou Weiqing, and more importantly to be able to react in case of
                                            any danger to any of the two. Of course, at the same time, he needed to keep
                                            his promise to Little Witch to keep her safe at all costs; after all she was
                                            already having her most precious thing stolen from her, and if she were
                                            further injured or lost her life, that would not be good.</p>
                                        <p>Long Big Fatty had been contemplating what sort of compensation he could give
                                            her.</p>
                                        <p>However, at this current moment, he was extremely vexed indeed. Although the
                                            billowing smoke from the volcano covered him from seeing anything, but the
                                            loud hoarse cries of Zhou Weiqing and the sweet tender moans of Little Witch
                                            continuously clashed against his keen senses.</p>
                                        <p>“Damn Little Fatty, don’t you have any conscience and humanity! Continuously
                                            provoking this hundred year old virgin… how can you bear to do it to your
                                            poor master! You little brat!” Long Shiya couldn’t help but mutter to
                                            himself.</p>
                                        <p>After a while, he burst out laughing at himself, shaking his head helplessly.
                                            “Dann it, this little brat is vigorous indeed. He hasn’t even solved his
                                            problem in the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and now he is incurring a new problem
                                            with the Heavenly Demon Sect. Very good, very good, with another Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace one at home. Maybe this little brat can conquer the five
                                            Great Saint Lands and unite them as one with his crotch, hahahahahaha. Sigh…
                                            I have spent too much time with this little brat, even my mind and thinking
                                            have been contaminated by him. Tcheh Tcheh.”</p>
                                        <p>If Zhou Weiqing was awake to hear Long Big Fatty’s mutterings, he would have
                                            immediately protested. How could he possibly have ‘contaminated’ others with
                                            dirty thoughts!</p>
                                        <p>The ‘activity’ around the volcano entrance would continue on, abruptly loud
                                            and sonorous, suddenly soft moaning and whimpers… a perfect description of
                                            highs and lows, as if the billowing smoke of the volcano was following the
                                            rise and fall of the sounds.</p>
                                        <p>An entire day and night. The activity at the top of the volcano did not cease
                                            for a long time, and this most primeval of sounds gave Long Big Fatty a
                                            bigger headache than even the thirty six days of constant watch and
                                            vigilance on Zhou Weiqing when he was fusing his bloodline powers.</p>
                                        <p>Without knowing when, the huge wings had wrapped around both their bodies,
                                            the thick purple light pulsing rhythmically about them. Around the purple
                                            mist that formed around them, there were a faint layer of green, but it was
                                            clearly on the weaker side.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch’s nubile young body had turned a faint pink, wrapped in Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s embrace. She had not fully lost consciousness, as she reached her
                                            peak time after time, substantiated and satiation filling her time and time
                                            again; all of this far from what she had expected and feared. If she died
                                            like this now, perhaps it would not be a bad thing… or so she thought.</p>
