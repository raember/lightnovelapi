                                        <p>Blink. Left with no choice, Zhou Weiqing could only use his last line of
                                            defensive, and two flashes of light passed by where his body was a moment
                                            ago, barely missing him.</p>
                                        <p>“Wait! Hold on a second!” Zhou Weiqing shouted out loud, as he dodged behind
                                            a tree.</p>
                                        <p>Surprisingly, the two BaoPo Battle Team members actually listened to him.
                                            They did not attack any further, resuming their hand holding, though their
                                            attentions and spirits were fully focused on Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stuck his head out cautiously, the customary honest grin on his
                                            face as he said: “Please, let’s not fight first, hear me out if you will, I
                                            have a proposition.”</p>
                                        <p>This BaoPo Battle Team couple were extremely attractive; the guy suave and
                                            handsome, and his lady beautifully stunning, looking the picture of a match
                                            made in heaven. Still, Zhou Weiqing recalled that they were not the two who
                                            had been leading the pack of BaoPo Battle Team members earlier, and
                                            shouldn’t be the most powerful in the team.</p>
                                        <p>The two of them looked at him curiously, interested in what he had to say.
                                            They were not in a rush; they had seen all of the Fei Li Battle Team’s
                                            fights, and Zhou Weiqing’s fight against Shen Little Demon had definitely
                                            left them a deep impression. Still, that did not mean that it was sufficient
                                            for them to attach too much importance to him.</p>
                                        <p>After all, not only did they have the numbers advantage, but as the members
                                            of the Passion Valley, they were extremely well versed in fighting together
                                            as a couple. Besides that, they had their pride as a member of a Great Saint
                                            Lands, and they felt they already had a good grasp on his powers and
                                            abilities, and were hence not afraid that he could escape their control.
                                            More importantly, the Blood Red Hell had always been the weakest of the four
                                            Great Saint Lands joining the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, usually taking the
                                            last position.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that they did not take action and were willing to hear him out, Zhou
                                            Weiqing stepped out from behind the tree, smiling as he said: “Hello, my
                                            name is Zhou Weiqing, may I have the honour of knowing your two esteemed
                                            names?”</p>
                                        <p>The man said: “My name is Ao Le, and this is my wife, Liu Yinan. Brother
                                            Zhou, your fight with Shen Little Demon in the preliminary heats was indeed
                                            amazing, beating her then has truly given you a name in that one fight, and
                                            it should be my honour to meet you.” As he said that, he lifted up his hand
                                            and smoothed his hair. Clearly, he placed much importance on customs and
                                            ceremony.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly said: “You are too kind, you are too kind. That was
                                            mostly luck indeed.”</p>
                                        <p>Ao Le smiled faintly, saying: “Bro Zhou, your Demonic Change State is indeed
                                            impressively powerful. I am quite clear about Shen Little Demon’s power,
                                            having fought her before, and I am confident of being equal to her. If I
                                            were to meet Bro Zhou for the first time, I would also definitely be hard
                                            pressed to take you down. In any case, enough with the pleasantries, why did
                                            Bro Zhou call out to us? This Lustre Spatial Realm is not very peaceful, and
                                            we do not want to stay too long here.”</p>
                                        <p>Inwardly, Zhou Weiqing was cursing away. <i>What call out to you?! Isn’t it
                                            you two who chased me all the way? </i>From this Ao Le’s words, he could
                                            tell that this fellow would be extremely difficult to handle. Although he
                                            was smiling away, his gaze was unwavering and focused, clearly the type who
                                            had a strong heart and resolute mind. This would not be an easy foe indeed.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>“Bro Ao Le, it is like this. As you know, this is the first time our Fei Li
                                            Battle Team has actually entered the Finals of the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament, and we have no experience at all, and are all unfamiliar with
                                            the Lustre Spatial Realm. As such, we know that we have no chance at all to
                                            get the championship, and have resigned ourselves so. However, in truth, we
                                            are likely to get the 4th position, but that would be rather sad and
                                            embarrassing. As such, I hope that we can cooperate together with the BaoPo
                                            Battle Team.”</p>
                                        <p>“Cooperate?” Ao Le looked on with interest at Zhou Weiqing, saying: “So… what
                                            sort of cooperation did you have in mind?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued: “Amongst the four teams in the Tournament, our Fei Li
                                            Battle Team is definitely the weakest. Also, I might be wrong, but I think
                                            that your BaoPo Battle Team should not be stronger than the WanShou or
                                            ZhongTian Battle Teams right? That is to say… both our teams are the two
                                            weakest teams in the Tournament. If we can work together, we could possibly
                                            get a much better result in this Tournament. For example, the three of us
                                            are currently together… Under such a situation, working together, if we meet
                                            any of the ZhongTian or WanShou Battle Team members, we will have a good
                                            chance of winning. If we meet anyone from our two Battle Teams, that would
                                            be even better, and we can keep growing our team while slowly whittling down
                                            the numbers of the ZhongTian and WanShou Battle Team members. In the end…
                                            perhaps we might actually be able to throw them all out of the Lustre
                                            Spatial Realm.”</p>
                                        <p>“At that point, the final champion will naturally be your BaoPo Battle Team,
                                            and we can also benefit from association to get a second position. Isn’t
                                            that a win-win situation ripe for cooperation?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Ao Le laughed heartily, saying: “Bro Zhou… that
                                            is a very good suggestion, and a great plan indeed. however , do you know
                                            what was the final placing in the last Heavenly Jewel Tournament?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started a little before saying: “No, I do not.”</p>
                                        <p>Ao Le smiled faintly, saying: “The final placement last Tournament was
                                            ZhongTian in the first place, us BaoPo in the second place, WanShou in the
                                            third place and DanDun in the fourth, and last place. Can you guess why
                                            something like that would happen?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s heart sank as he said: “Could it be… you and the ZhongTian
                                            Battle Team…”</p>
                                        <p>Still smiling faintly, Ao Le inclined his head, saying: “Indeed, your guess
                                            is very accurate. Our BaoPo Empire and ZhongTian Empire have always been
                                            allies, no matter in war, or in this Heavenly Jewel Tournament. The WanShou
                                            Battle Team is indeed powerful, but they are our common enemies.
                                            Furthermore, our Passion Valley also has a secret arts allowing man and wife
                                            like us to have a very close connection. As such, even though we are in this
                                            Lustre Spatial Realm, we are able to reunite relatively easily, to get a
                                            numbers advantage. Your plan is very good indeed, and I am truly impressed,
                                            but I’m afraid that your Fei Li Battle Team does not have the qualification
                                            to work together with us. I’m sorry Bro Zhou… Now, do you want to use your
                                            Lustre Gem directly, or do we have to force you to do so?”</p>
                                        <p>Ao Le had been polite, almost amiable, the entire time, but with those words
                                            of not having the qualification, he showed the pride and arrogance of a
                                            disciple of the Great Saint Lands, as well as his disdain for the Fei Li
                                            Battle Team. From the beginning, he had not even felt they were worthy of
                                            his attentions as opponents, and naturally would not cooperate with
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned broadly. Naturally, he had hoped that his suggestion
                                            would be accepted, and if it were, he was confident in making it work, as it
                                            would be a good win-win situation. As for how the final result would be, it
                                            would be hard to say. Yet, that did not mean he was afraid of them. Ao Le’s
                                            words had confirmed that there was no longer any shred of possibility of
                                            them working together, and a fight was definitely coming.</p>
                                        <p>Ao Le saw that natural big grin on Zhou Weiqing’s face, and couldn’t help but
                                            ask: “Bro Zhou, what are you grinning about.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said calmly: “I’m grinning because your time in this Tournament
                                            has come to its end.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he struck the ground hard with his right foot, his entire
                                            body charging forward towards the pair like a cannonball. In midair, his
                                            entire body turned a darker black shade as the familiar black tiger tattoos
                                            covered his entire body and a powerful, violent aura erupted from him. It
                                            was the Demonic Change State.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing charge at them, A cold light flashed in Ao Le’s eyes, and
                                            he smiled coldly: “Hmph, I am not Shen Little Demon!”</p>
                                        <p>Both Ao Le and Liu Yinan raised their hands, unleashing their Heavenly Jewels
                                            at once.</p>
                                        <p>Ao Le was at the six-Jeweled cultivation level, while Liu Yinan was at the
                                            five-Jeweled level. Ao Le’s Physical Jewels were the same as Zhou Weiqing’s,
                                            the Icy Jade representing Strength, while Liu Yinan’s were the Waxy Jade
                                            representing stamina. As for their Elemental Jewels, both of theirs were
                                            exactly the same, and they did not bother concealing them at all.</p>
                                        <p>It was a rather strange looking gemstone, its entire body a dull dim yellow
                                            colour, but it was glowing with a soft light that seemed to twist and warp
                                            the very air around it.</p>
                                        <p>A weird yellow light flashed out from their hands respectively, twisting the
                                            light rays as it sped towards Zhou Weiqing and enveloped him,</p>
                                        <p>Instantly, Zhou Weiqing slowed drastically in mid charge, as if he was acting
                                            in some slow motion picture.</p>
                                        <p>Slow Barrier!</p>
                                        <p>That strange barrier of yellow light was naturally the Slow Barrier that Ao
                                            Le and Liu Yinan had unleashed with their combined efforts. They both had
                                            Stored the same Skill, and releasing it together would not only increase its
                                            power, but also its area of effect.</p>
                                        <p>Realising that his speed had been slowed drastically, a alarmed, panicked
                                            look appeared on Zhou Weiqing’s face, as his flailing fists in the air
                                            slowed to a crawl as he struggled with all his might, only to see his speed
                                            grow slower and slower.</p>
                                        <p>Ao Le did not rush into attacking Zhou Weiqing, instead smiling as he said:
                                            “Bro Zhou, how is the feeling of this Slow Barrier of our husband and wife
                                            team? In truth, losing to our Time Attribute should be an honour to you.
                                            After all, the Time Attribute is one of the three Great Saint Attributes;
                                            even in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, no one has an Attribute like this.
                                            Although your Evil Attribute is not bad, but alas your cultivation level is
                                            just too low. Facing this Slow Barrier that both of us have worked together
                                            to release, you do not stand a chance…”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, Ao Le lifted up his left hand, waving it towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing. At the same time, he stuck out his index finger and middle fingers,
                                            slowly drawing a line in midair at Zhou Weiqing’s body.</p>
                                        <p>Two lines of yellow light shot out from his two fingers, not making a sound
                                            as they struck out at Zhou Weiqing, who felt everything darken around him,
                                            as if everything had become unreal, all part of an illusion.</p>
                                        <p>Ao Le’s voice seemed to come from all directions: “This Skill is called
                                            Interlocking Time. The two bouts of light from my fingers will each slow and
                                            hasten the time in the area by one second respectively. Time will start
                                            changing, warping and become unstable, causing a massive energy field. This
                                            is similar in principle to your Spatial Rend, just that my Interlocking Time
                                            cannot be dodged. Goodbye now, Bro Zhou.”</p>
                                        <p>The Interlocking Time Skill was not just a powerful attacking skill, but was
                                            also considered a Control Skill at the same time. As one of the Great Saint
                                            Attributes, the Time Attribute was definitely a force to be reckoned with,
                                            and not one of its Skills could be considered ‘simple’.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had already been slowed and stuck in the Slow Barrier, and now
                                            with this Interlocking Skill used upon him, it was as if his entire body was
                                            frozen in space and time, unable to move. From the way things were going, it
                                            seemed as if the two bouts of yellow light were about to tear his body into
                                            two.</p>
                                        <p>From Ao Le’s perspective, the only hope for Zhou Weiqing now was to activate
                                            his Lustre Gem and retreat from the Spatial Realm, otherwise he would be
                                            torn apart by his powerful skill. After all, the power levels between the
                                            two of them was just too huge, and his Interlocking Time Skill was also one
                                            of the top Time Skills available.</p>
                                        <p>Yet… just as Ao Le and Liu Yinan thought that victory was in their grasp, a
                                            strange sight occurred…</p>
                                        <p>A layer of invisible, twisting light appeared around Zhou Weiqing’s body,
                                            streaking across momentarily before disappearing.</p>
                                        <p></p>

                                            mentioned that the teams would enter in order of their previous ranking, and
                                            WanShou Battle Team was actually mentioned before BaoPo. Checked several
