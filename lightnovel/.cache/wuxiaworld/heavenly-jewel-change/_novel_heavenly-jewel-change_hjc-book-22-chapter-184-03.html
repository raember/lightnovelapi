                                            disadvantageous position, the ‘crying-face’ Hammer in his right hand swept
                                            forward, a thick blue light exploding out from it.</p>
                                        <p>A massive explosion. Only then did the snow white light rebounded away,
                                            revealing Shangguan Xue’er there, but Zhou Weiqing had staggered back six
                                            steps before he recovered his balance.</p>
                                        <p>With a single blow from her sword, Shangguan Xue’er had not only broken
                                            through five layers of his Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura, she
                                            had even forced him back. More so, that intense sword intent caused Zhou
                                            Weiqing to feel a slight sense of numbness.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Shangguan Xue’er still had her eyes closed. As for Zhou Weiqing,
                                            even as he was staggering back, his dual Legendary Hammers were already in
                                            movement.</p>
                                        <p>The Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation glowed brilliantly, and balls of blue
                                            light floated out from the Legendary Hammers one after the other, blotting
                                            up the area as they floated towards Shangguan Xue’er.</p>
                                        <p>This was the major advantage of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, not
                                            only the nearly infinite Heavenly Energy, but also the lack of a cooldown
                                            for those mimicked Skills. In his training, Zhou Weiqing had chosen his main
                                            offensive Attribute to be the Lightning Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst his six Attributes, the Lightning Attribute was not the strongest.
                                            However, it was without question that the burst damage potential of the
                                            Lightning Attribute was one of the strongest, without too much Heavenly
                                            Energy expenditure. Zhou Weiqing’s choice was a constant stream of attacks
                                            that wouldn’t stop. If it were any of his other Attributes, that would not
                                            match his requirement. As such, he had chosen the Lightning Attribute. After
                                            all, do not forget that his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation also allowed
                                            him to Fuse Attributes.</p>
                                        <p>With Zhou Weiqing’s current cultivation level, he would not be able to fuse
                                            all Six Attribute like Long Shiya could, but fusing two or three was no
                                            issue.</p>
                                        <p>At least several hundred of those Lightning pearls flew out, and under the
                                            fine control of Zhou Weiqing, it fully covered Shangguan Xue’er and any
                                            possible retreat or dodging options and angles.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s eyes remained closed, the Boundless Infinitum Sword was
                                            trembling slightly. That trembling was actually due to the strike from the
                                            ‘crying-face’ hammer.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s sword skills and sword intent, along with the explosive
                                            power of the Boundless Infinitum Sword, it was truly a terrifying power
                                            indeed. However, Zhou Weiqing with his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set
                                            and all the pure physical strength he had was not something that could be
                                            easily dismissed as well, especially in his Dragon-Tiger Transformation
                                            state. Even Shangguan Xue’er at full power was not able to clash with him
                                            directly. The reason why Zhou Weiqing staggered back six steps was not
                                            because of the direct power, but the sword intent held within. If he had not
                                            retreated, he would have been injured by the sword intent.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s expression remained impassive, as if those several hundred
                                            Lightning pearls were not a threat to her.</p>
                                        <p>In that next instant, the Boundless Infinitum Sword burst into action. As
                                            compared to the previous ‘body and sword as one’, it was now a steady and
                                            smooth flow of actions. All Zhou Weiqing could see was countless slim white
                                            threads burst forth from the sword.</p>
                                        <p>Each and every strike landed perfectly on a Lightning pearl, as Shangguan
                                            Xue’er spun around in a move that seemed like a beautiful dance move, all
                                            the Lightning pearls had been swept aside, not a single one exploding.</p>
                                        <p>This was not an easy feat indeed. In order to ensure that a Lightning pearl
                                            did not explode, the only way was to strike it right in the center heart of
                                            it, destroying its core before it could explode, not allowing the Lightning
                                            Element Attribute Heavenly Energy within to be unleashed.</p>
                                        <p>More importantly, those several hundred Lightning pearls were all under Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s control. Yet, all of them had been dealt with by Shangguan Xue’er
                                            in a single instant. What kind of swordsmanship was that?! Let alone seeing
                                            anything like this before, Zhou Weiqing had not even heard of such a
                                            thing!</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Shangguan Xue’er’s entire body was surrounded by a layer of
                                            blue light; after she destroyed several hundred Lightning pearls, the vast
                                            amount of Lightning Attribute Heavenly Energy had been released back into
                                            the atmosphere.</p>
                                        <p>Thus far, Shangguan Xue’er had only showed her swordsmanship twice. The first
                                            time was the simple piercing strike at the start of the fight, a simple and
                                            seemingly basic move that was actually so boundlessly heavy. As for the
                                            second strike, it was a countless stream of fine attacks.</p>
                                        <p>With just two mere attacks, Zhou Weiqing, who had always thought of himself
                                            as invincible amongst any equal stage enemies, was left drenched in cold
                                            sweat. The only thing in his mind was - he had actually been intimate with
                                            such a beauty, was this luck?!</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er would not change her actions just because of Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            psychological changes. The Boundless Infinitum Sword swirled around in the
                                            air, white light shining brightly. Abruptly, the Boundless Infinitum Sword
                                            seemed to have a strange suction force, and the thick Lightning Attribute
                                            Heavenly Energy was drawn into it, turning the blade of the sword into a
                                            purplish blue.</p>
                                        <p>A step forward, a forward pierce. All of Shangguan Xue’er’s actions seemed so
                                            basic, yet terrifyingly powerful. If Zhou Weiqing had to describe that
                                            attack, he would say it was simple, yet resplendent.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, simple but resplendent, and more so, he found he was unable to dodge
                                            it. This sword was not just with the powerful sword intent, but filled with
                                            all of the Lightning Attribute Heavenly Energy that Zhou Weiqing had
                                            summoned up earlier!</p>
                                        <p>A path that brought the basics to the extreme. This was the core of Shangguan
                                            Xue’er’s sword mastery. She did not have any Stored Skills, everything used
                                            on the single sword, and with it she could destroy everything.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was left with no other choice, and the only thing he could do
                                            was to lift up the ‘crying-face hammer’ in his hands to block the incoming
                                            blow</p>
                                        <p>*BOOOM*</p>
                                        <p>An explosion that seemed to almost shake the world, and Zhou Weiqing’s body
                                            was blown back instantly.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s body also flew back, the Boundless Infinitum Sword in her
                                            hands trembling once more. It was not that she did not want to press the
                                            advantage and follow up on the attack, but she was just unable to do so. The
                                            strength behind those Legendary Hammers were just too terrifying. Though she
                                            had been able to knock Zhou Weiqing back with her sword intent and the
                                            explosive power of the lightning elements, she was still unable to fully
                                            dissipate the power from those hammers.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, the defensive capabilities of the Dragon-Tiger
                                            Transformation was just too disgusting. Although Zhou Weiqing had been sent
                                            flying back, he was actually totally unharmed. It was just that this was the
                                            first time he had ever experienced a foe like Shangguan Xue’er, as such,
                                            caught by surprise and off balance, he had not been unable to react properly
                                            to such unfamiliar techniques. It was somewhat like how the Lion King Gu
                                            Site had felt when facing him indeed!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not rush into releasing other Skills, instead taking a
                                            stance with his hammers. He took a deep breath, trying to clear his mind and
                                            calm down.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s power had far surpassed all of his expectations. Only if
                                            he calmed down, cleared his mind and focused with all his might could he
                                            stand a chance at all.</p>
                                        <p>The tip of her feet touching the ground lightly, Shangguan Xue’er flew up
                                            into the air once more. As her body rose into the air, the sides of her
                                            shoulder pauldrons actually extended. Although they were not actually wings
                                            that could beat and fly like Zhou Weiqing had after entering his
                                            Dragon-Tiger Transformation, those extensions enabled her to glide in
                                            midair. Her movements quick like lightning, the sword in hand warped into
                                            thousands of different strikes from all directions, slashing and piercing
                                            down towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Clearly, Shangguan Xue’er knew that she could never gain any advantage by
                                            clashing directly. The pure physical strength behind the hammers were more
                                            than enough to close any gap from Heavenly Energy, even able to suppress a
                                            portion of her sword intent. As such, she switched to using her techniques,
                                            overwhelming him with her fine swordsmanship.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of fine technique, even ten of Zhou Weiqing was no match for a
                                            single Shangguan Xue’er. The pure strength behind his hammers might be much
                                            more terrifying, but in terms of speed and agility, how could they compare
                                            with her sword?</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing still had his own advantages. More so, he had always
                                            been a person who was extremely adaptable and able to use any advantage in
                                            the best possible way.</p>
                                        <p>Once again, an almost exact replica of the previous scene came into play, as
                                            several hundred Lightning pearls were unleashed from Zhou Weiqing’s hammers.
                                            To any Heavenly Jewel Master, using his Heavenly Energy so generously like
                                            that was pretty inconceivable. Yet, to Zhou Weiqing, it was no big deal with
                                            his insane regeneration. Perhaps in that instant, he could not regenerate
                                            all the Heavenly Energy back, but his terrifying regeneration was a constant
                                            effect, and he was not using his Skills all the time. As such, Zhou Weiqing
                                            was not worried that he might run out of energy at all, especially since he
                                            was using his Lightning Attribute, not the Darkness, Spatial, Time or
                                            Demonic Attributes which were even more costly. For those, he would still
                                            have to take energy into account before unleashing too many Skills.</p>
                                        <p>It was not that Zhou Weiqing had not thought of switching to other Attributes
                                            as his main offensive force, but Long Shiya had told him. In terms of the
                                            Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, at least before his cultivation level
                                            reached the Heavenly King Stage and beyond, it would be best for him to
                                            focus on one and train in it, and it would be far superior to trying to
                                            practice every single Attribute. After all, such training and usage of power
                                            all had their similarities, and once he had mastered a single Attribute to
                                            the extreme, when his cultivation level reached a certain level in the
                                            future, it would be easy to transfer that knowledge to using the other
                                            attributes as well. The reverse would actually be slower and detrimental to
                                            his overall growth. Furthermore, one of Zhou Weiqing’s strongest future
                                            power would be the widespread use of his Dark Demon God Lightning, akin to
                                            how the Dark Demon God Tiger had used it in his vision. Currently, using his
                                            Lightning Attribute as his main offensive tool in the Six Ultimate Godly
                                            Light Formation was a suitable start for him indeed.</p>
                                        <p>Another several hundred Lightning pearls against Shangguan Xue’er’s
                                            terrifying swordplay. Would the result be the same, with the pearls being
                                            destroyed, and their energy used by Shangguan Xue’er? The answer was a
                                            definite no.</p>
                                        <p>With the fine control over the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation towards the
                                            Lightning pearls, would Zhou Weiqing really make a similar mistake
                                            twice?</p>
                                        <p>Just as the rain of light from Shangguan Xue’er’s sword was about to strike
                                            the sea of Lightning pearls once more, there was a strange energy
                                            fluctuation from the pearls. At the same time, a layer of grey light sprang
                                            into existence around Zhou Weiqing’s body.</p>
                                        <p>*Boom**Boom**Boom**Boom**Boom* A series of small explosions that seemed
                                            infinite, combining into one massive major soundwave. In the seemingly small
                                            energy wave reverberation, the massive amount of Lightning pearls exploded
                                            in a series of chain reactions.</p>
                                        <p>Since you are able to disable them and prevent my Lightning pearls from
                                            exploding, I’ll just set them off before you do so! That was Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            current action. He controlled the energy reverberations of the Lightning
                                            pearls and caused them to explode as he willed. The terrifying explosion was
                                            the pushed outwards with the Ward of the Demon God he had summoned, causing
                                            the external force of the explosion to be magnified. These two Skills might
                                            seem independent, but they had a surprising synergy indeed. Besides Blink,
                                            the Ward of the Demon God was the second Stored Skill that Zhou Weiqing had
                                            imbued into his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation this time.</p>
                                        <p>As the Lightning pearls exploded, Zhou Weiqing ignored the sudden massive
                                            drain on his Heavenly Energy. At the same time, a purple-red light appeared
                                            above his head, forming a faint illusory figure… It was the Demonic Dragon
                                            Lady!</p>
                                        <p></p>
