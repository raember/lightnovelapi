                                            eyes.</p>
                                        <p>*BANG* Even as Zhou Weiqing was struck by Zhan LingTian’s piercing attack,
                                            how could it be without any price to pay? The crying-face Hammer slammed
                                            savagely into his shoulders, and Zhan LingTian’s entire body flew like a
                                            cannonball several hundred metres away. As for Zhou Weiqing, though his body
                                            was swaying, he still stood firmly there.</p>
                                        <p>The wings behind his back slowly retracted into his body as he left the
                                            Dragon-Tiger Transformation state, and Zhou Weiqing pointed his Hammers
                                            towards Zhan LingTian, shouting coldly: “You have lost.”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, Zhan LingTian had lost. Although he had a Legendary Set, one uniquely
                                            tailored for his Light-Dark Divine Spear… he had still lost.</p>
                                        <p>His armour could not withstand the final blow, and as soon as Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            savage hammer blow landed, it totally shattered the Consolidated armour
                                            around Zhan LingTian’s shoulder. At the same time, his entire shoulder was
                                            smashed up, the Heavenly Energy in his body almost scattered totally by the
                                            blow. His defenses were far from being able to handle such a hit from Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian no longer had any capacity of fighting left within him. He had
                                            never imagined that even with such a mighty blow that held all his power, in
                                            the end he was still unable to defeat Zhou Weiqing. The damage from this
                                            final hammer blow, he would need to cultivate and recuperate for at least
                                            half a year to one year before he could fully recover. This was an estimate
                                            that was even after the aid of the precious Heavenly Jewel Island
                                            medicines.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had won this fight between love rivals, but as he spoke the
                                            words ‘You have lost’, his eyes subconsciously turned to the other side.</p>
                                        <p>Three young women, looking exactly the same, with astonishing beauty that
                                            could topple kingdoms, were rushing towards them at a surprising speed. In a
                                            flash, they had appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Perhaps the true tragedy was that these three beautiful women only had eyes
                                            for Zhou Weiqing, none of them even looking at Zhan LingTian who had been
                                            blown away.</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty!” A voice… so familiar… one that he had dreamed of countless
                                            times… rang out suddenly. In that instant, Zhou Weiqing felt his entire soul
                                            shudder.</p>
                                        <p>A rich, strong sense of yearning, filled with love. His body glowed in a
                                            flash as the Consolidated Equipment disappeared. Looking at the worried and
                                            concerned figure in front of him, he abruptly opened his arms, pulling her
                                            into his embrace.</p>
                                        <p>However, in that instant, Zhou Weiqing’s body slowly fell back, toppling down
                                            onto the ground even as the startled cries of the young girl rang out.</p>
                                        <p>The other two beautiful young ladies could clearly see that at Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            chest area, a scary looking ‘flower’ of blood slowly appearing. In that
                                            instant, it was as if they had lost their ability to breathe.</p>
                                        <p>The three young ladies who had just appeared were naturally the three
                                            Shangguan Sisters. The news that Zhou Weiqing had ascended the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Island had traveled to them rather quickly, and Shangguan Bing’er’s
                                            yearning and longing for Zhou Weiqing was no less than his! With her strong
                                            pleading, the three sisters had rushed towards the inn where the Heavenly
                                            Bow Battle Team had settled in. Alas, Zhou Weiqing had been too urgent,
                                            having rushed out after the team settled in and bringing the team to the
                                            Consolidating Equipment Pavilion. As a result, the three sisters had missed
                                            the Heavenly Bow Battle Team totally.</p>
                                        <p>After which, the three sisters had headed to the Consolidating Equipment
                                            Pavilion, but after walking through it once, they were still unable to find
                                            Zhou Weiqing. It was only until they met Tian’er there did they realise Zhou
                                            Weiqing had actually gone to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, thus delaying
                                            their arrival so much.</p>
                                        <p>As Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er saw the spreading flower of blood at
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s chest, both stared in shock momentarily before throwing
                                            themselves down, supporting him from each side.</p>
                                        <p>This was the front of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and the guards in front
                                            could only stare in shock, their mouths agape. Naturally, they recognized
                                            the three Shangguan Sisters, they were the three Princesses of the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace! However… they were actually currently… for the same
                                            man…This… this was something far out of their imaginations!</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er held onto Zhou Weiqing tightly, tears streaming down her
                                            face uncontrollably. Looking at the ashen complexion of Zhou Weiqing, she
                                            said anxiously: “Little Fatty, Little Fatty, don’t scare me!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stared at Shangguan Bing’er, unable to tear his eyes off her.
                                            “Bing’er, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…”</p>
                                        <p>After the three apologies, Zhou Weiqing fainted right in her arms.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er held Zhou Weiqing tightly, tears streaming down her cheeks
                                            as she was sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er both had worried looks on their faces.
                                            As Shangguan Xue’er’s cultivation level was the highest, she started to
                                            infuse her Heavenly Energy slowly into Zhou Weiqing’s body, and she could
                                            instantly sense the Light and Darkness energy still raging wantonly in his
                                            body. Luckily, it wasn’t a large amount of it, and as Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            Heavenly Energy circulated, it was slowly being dissipated by the energy
                                            whirlpools of the Death Acupuncture Points.</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, although Zhan LingTian was severely injured, he was still
                                            able to barely stand up. Upon seeing the three Shangguan Sisters all
                                            surrounding Zhou Weiqing and ignoring him, he suddenly vomited a mouthful of
                                            fresh blood and also fainted. As the one who injured Zhou Weiqing, even if
                                            he was from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, at this current moment the three
                                            Shangguan Sisters did not sympathize with him, and the other Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace members quickly supported Zhan LingTian away.</p>
                                        <p>“That’s not right! With his current combat abilities, how could he be injured
                                            so easily by Senior Brother Zhan?” After sensing the light and darkness
                                            energies in Zhou Weiqing’s body slowly dissipating, Shangguan Xue’er
                                            couldn’t help but say curiously.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er did not have her usual demeanor of the Little Demon Girl of
                                            the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, saying urgently: “What’s so wrong about that?
                                            Didn’t you see as we were rushing here, he was just trying to end the fight
                                            as quickly as possible so that he could see Bing’er quickly, so he actually
                                            used his body as bait to lure his opponent in.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded, the shred of uncertainty in her heart vanishing.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er was indeed correct. At that time, when Zhou Weiqing had
                                            struck out at Zhan LingTian, he was prepared to use such a method of direct
                                            clashing to resolve their fight quickly; after all, Zhan LingTian was no
                                            easy foe, so it was considered a type of tactics to lure in the enemy.
                                            However, one thing she had not realised was that Zhou Weiqing had actually
                                            purposely allowed the spear blow to hit him, and he had been willing to do
                                            so.</p>
                                        <p>To accept Zhan LingTian’s blow like that was not because Zhou Weiqing wanted
                                            to garner sympathy from the three Shangguan Sisters, but it was a form of
                                            self punishment. He felt that he had let down Shangguan Bing’er so much,
                                            three days he had not seen her, yet he had ended up having unclear relations
                                            with Tian’er, Fei’er and Xue’er one after the other. Now that he was about
                                            to see Shangguan Bing’er again, although he missed her so much, he did not
                                            know how to face her. As such, he had purposely let down his own guard and
                                            defenses, allowing Zhan LingTian to injure him. Of course, since it was
                                            under his control, that was not too serious an injury.</p>
                                        <p>If not for him allowing that, with the Light-Dark Divine Spear of Zhan
                                            LingTian that had already expended so much energy, it would definitely not
                                            be able to break through his Immortal Deity Shield and the powerful physique
                                            and skin of him in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state.</p>
                                        <p>The three Shangguan Sisters carried Zhou Weiqing into the Heaven's Expanse
                                            Palace, directly entering Shangguan Bing’er’s room. However, when they
                                            removed his shirt to check his wounds, they discovered that the previously
                                            severe looking wound on his chest was actually closing and healing at an
                                            astonishing rate, and the light and darkness energy Zhan LingTian had
                                            infused in had disappeared totally.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that Zhou Weiqing was no longer in any danger, the three Shangguan
                                            Sisters heaved a sigh of relief. In truth, at that time when Zhou Weiqing
                                            fainted, the wound on his chest was secondary. More importantly, when he saw
                                            Shangguan Bing’er he had been overly agitated, thus aggravating the wound in
                                            his chest, and he had thus lapsed into a short faint.</p>
                                        <p>Although Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er really wanted to stay here to
                                            continue looking after her, in the end the two sisters exchanged looks and
                                            left stealthily, leaving the room to Shangguan Bing’er, who had tears in her
                                            eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s physique was extremely powerful indeed, and it did not take
                                            long for him to slowly regain consciousness. As he woke up, Zhou Weiqing
                                            instantly sensed a small, soft hand gripping his own tightly, as if afraid
                                            that he would disappear as soon as it let go.</p>
                                        <p>“Bing’er.” As soon as Zhou Weiqing’ opened his eyes, he saw the beautiful,
                                            gentle eyes that were red from crying. The emotions and love in his heart
                                            burst forth, and he sat up abruptly, enveloping her in his embrace tightly.
                                            In that instant, it was as if he wished he could hug her so hard that they
                                            merged together.</p>
                                        <p>It was just a normal, pure hug. With Zhou Weiqing’s character, he actually
                                            did not make any further intimate contact with her, just hugging her tightly
                                            as the emotions and love surged in his heart. In his warm embrace, as if his
                                            entire chest was molten, Shangguan Bing’er felt as if she were melting right
                                            into him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing’er for a time, not even knowing how long he
                                            did so, until his feelings calmed down slightly. At last, he murmured: “I’m
                                            sorry, Bing’er. I…”</p>
                                        <p>Bing’er moved her face to nuzzle Zhou Weiqing’s neck closely, saying: “Don’t
                                            say anymore, Little Fatty. If I really blamed you, would I come to see you
                                            now? I should be the one to apologise to you…”</p>
                                        <p>“Ah?” Zhou Weiqing was given a fright, almost thinking that Bing’er was
                                            speaking in opposites. Subconsciously, he looked up at her, but all he saw
                                            was a pair of beautiful, gentle and loving eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Lifting her hand to stroke Zhou Weiqing’s cheek, Shangguan Bing’er said
                                            gently: “Little Fatty, it is my fault. I was not able to be by your side
                                            during your toughest times, to accompany you through that suffering. I only
                                            discovered what happened to our Heavenly Bow Empire not long ago when I came
                                            out of the closed door cultivation… our homeland… your family… all
                                            destroyed; yet at that time I was not able to accompany you by your side. I
                                            can imagine how much you have suffered these three years, how much pain you
                                            must have been in… all the stress and pressure you must have been under,
                                            that you had to shoulder everything, all the responsibilities. I do not
                                            blame Tian’er, nor do I blame sisters. In that most difficult time, the pain
                                            and weakness in your heart, I can imagine that. As long as there was someone
                                            to accompany you and help you through it, I can only be happy and ashamed. I
                                            should not have chosen to stay here… at that time, I only thought that if I
                                            did not work hard and improve my strength, I would not be able to follow
                                            your footsteps any longer. I’m so sorry Little Fatty, can you forgive
                                            me?”</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Shangguan Bing’er’s apologetic look, Zhou Weiqing once again held her
                                            tightly in his arms, as he couldn’t help but cherish her even more. With
                                            such a wife, what else could a man want? In that instant, Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            heart was full of love and tenderness.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed! She was his Bing’er, forever only thinking about him… even when he
                                            had other women, she had never complained or showed any ‘colours’ towards
                                            him, instead blaming herself… pulling all the burdens upon her own
                                            shoulders!</p>
                                        <p></p>
