                                        <p>Xue AoTian looked at the two of them and said in a serious tone: “Next, you
                                            will both be facing Heavenly Emperor stage Heavenly Beasts. I do not need to
                                            remind you too much, for Heavenly Beasts to reach the Heavenly Emperor
                                            stage, it is without question that they also have extremely high quality
                                            bloodlines. As such, your advantage of bloodline will not be that obvious,
                                            and you may even run the risk of being counter-injured.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing’s faces turned serious. Overwhelming a Heavenly
                                            Emperor stage Heavenly Beast. They had never even dreamed of doing it at
                                            their current levels, let alone trying it out, and they did not know whether
                                            or not they could succeed.</p>
                                        <p>*Boom* *Boom* *Boom*</p>
                                        <p>A low, rumbling thunder shook the entire cave as it rang out. The Heavenly
                                            Beasts that they would face had not even appeared, but a terrifying and
                                            oppressive presence could already be felt.</p>
                                        <p>The expressions of both Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing instantly changed. In
                                            their hearts, they suddenly had the strange misconception - Who was the one
                                            doing the overwhelming?! The two Heavenly Emperor stage Beasts had not even
                                            appeared, and they were already barely able to hold on. Such a level of
                                            power, was it really possible for them to succeed? Wasn’t that just a
                                            fantastical dream?</p>
                                        <p>Even if it were a lowest level Heavenly Emperor Stage Beast, it was still the
                                            difference of heaven and earth compared to a max level Heavenly King Stage
                                            Beast!</p>
                                        <p>The two youths were not the only ones whose expressions changed. Long Shiya,
                                            the Tiger King and Lion King also looked serious. With their cultivation
                                            level, they could easily sense the sheer power of the two incoming Heavenly
                                            Beasts - not Low Level Heavenly Emperor Stage, but at the Mid Level Heavenly
                                            Emperor Stage! Besides Xue AoTian, only Long Shiya actually had any
                                            confidence that they could overwhelm Beasts of such a level with only their
                                            aura and presence.</p>
                                        <p>Soon, two unbelievably immense figures appeared in their sights, so massive
                                            that it was almost terrifying. This cavern was extremely huge and spacious,
                                            but as soon as the two Heavenly Beasts appeared, it was as if the cavern had
                                            suddenly become too tiny.</p>
                                        <p>Both Beasts were more than ten metres tall, fifteen metres in length, their
                                            bodies covered with long white fur with huge tusks protruding out like two
                                            terrifying lumbering mountains of doom.</p>
                                        <p>Mammoths! These were Mammoth - Type Heavenly Beasts!</p>
                                        <p>Mammoth Type Heavenly Beasts were extremely talented, their bloodlines
                                            ensuring they could reach at least Upper Level Zong Stage or higher. These
                                            two were magnificent species amongst their kind, obviously with their
                                            Heavenly Emperor Stage, and they were Lords and Leaders amongst all Mammoth
                                            type Beasts.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya muttered: “Snow Lord Mammoths. These huge fellows. Old Monster
                                            Xue, you are already bringing these out on the eighth round? How can they
                                            possibly succeed in overwhelming them? Do you think they have already
                                            reached our level?”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian glanced at Long Shiya before saying passively: “From this round
                                            onwards, the test is reversed. Yingbing, you and Zhou Weiqing will have to
                                            withstand the oppressive pressure of these Snow Lord Mammoths for 5 minutes.
                                            If anyone fails in that time, you will have lost the round. If both of you
                                            can withstand the pressure, then we will go on to the ninth round…”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes, Master.” Gu Yingbing said respectfully. He couldn’t help but heave a
                                            huge sigh of relief in his heart. At least it was not an impossible task.
                                            Withstanding pressure and attempting to overwhelm these Heavenly Beasts was
                                            a hugely different task.</p>
                                        <p>By this time, the two massive mammoths had already lumbered to the front of
                                            Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing respectively. If one thought their presence was
                                            terrifying just now, the addition of their massive bodies in front of them
                                            brought some strange new pressure!</p>
                                        <p>Snow Lord Mammoths. These monstrous beasts had the Ice, Earth and Wind
                                            Attributes, and their innate talent was to berserk. In the entire Ten
                                            Thousand Beast Heavens, they were highly ranked and respected. In the
                                            WanShou Empire, there was a Legion of controlled Heavenly Beasts controlled
                                            only by the Heavenly Snow Mountain. It was also one of the main reasons why
                                            the other four Great Saint Lands feared them so much. The Legion Commander
                                            of that Legion had a Snow Lord Mammoth mount, and one could imagine how
                                            powerful it was for such a high ranked powerhouse.</p>
                                        <p>They were able to control winds and snows, trample across the earth in
                                            stampedes. They were considered a rare breed that were equally power in both
                                            offense and defense.</p>
                                        <p>Such powerful Heavenly Beasts, even Long Shiya would have a bit of trouble in
                                            defeating them. For Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing, it was definitely
                                            impossible for them stand against them. The Snow Lord Mammoths might not
                                            seem to have any scales or armour, but their pure white fur was actually
                                            deceptively tough, one of the strongest defenses. Even a full powered attack
                                            from a Max Level Heavenly King Stage powerhouse might not be able to cause
                                            any damage to them. Of course, one had to consider that these powerful
                                            Heavenly Beasts were under full control of Xue AoTian, and from that alone
                                            one could tell how powerful this Heavenly God Tier powerhouse was.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion King Gu Site’s somber eyes were suddenly filled with a burning heat.
                                            Even he had not expected that the Heavenly Snow Mountain held so much power.
                                            If… his son could control the Heavenly Snow Mountain in the future… perhaps…
                                            they would be able to sweep over the entire mainland!</p>
                                        <p>*ROARR* Almost at the same time, two resounding roars rang out from the two
                                            Snow Lord Mammoths, their long trunks raised up in the air. Instantly, a
                                            powerful layer of green-blue light sprang forth from their bodies,
                                            enveloping Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing’s bodies respectively.</p>
                                        <p>In the next instant, Zhou Weiqing felt as if he was trapped in a world of ice
                                            and snow. The surrounding air plummeted to absolute zero, the frigid
                                            temperatures buffeting him along with the cruel pressure of the Mammoth’s
                                            terrifying aura, feeling like uncountable sharp ice shards slicing all over
                                            his body. A massive spiritual pressure descended upon him like a huge
                                            mountain from the skies, smashing down over his head.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a muffled grunt as he staggered back subconsciously. Even
                                            under the Demonic Change State, he was almost unable to withstand this
                                            terrifying pressure.</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, Gu Yingbing was in a much better state than Zhou Weiqing.
                                            After all, his cultivation level was at the nine-Jeweled stage, much higher
                                            than Zhou Weiqing. He had not staggered back, holding his ground, though his
                                            expression had turned very ugly and his body was trembling slightly. The
                                            golden-red light around him was so thick that it was as if an actual solid
                                            burning shroud was around him, as the thick Heavenly Energy reverberations
                                            around him denoted his channeling of his spirit to the maximum.</p>
                                        <p>Alas for these poor two young souls, both Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing had
                                            just been foolish enough to be relieved and think that withstanding the
                                            pressure would be easier than overwhelming. Now, they knew what a joke their
                                            previous thoughts had been just an instant ago. Facing a Heavenly Emperor
                                            stage was never a trifling task.</p>
                                        <p>Having reached the Mid Level Heavenly Emperor stage, as soon as the Snow Lord
                                            Mammoths’ powerful aura smashed down upon them, they realised it was far
                                            more difficult than when they were trying previously to overwhelm the Max
                                            Level Heavenly King Stage Beasts!</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, this pressure was now reverse. That was to say, they definitely
                                            had to hold on the best they could, otherwise failure would also lead to
                                            serious injury. More importantly… that already-terrifying pressure was still
                                            increasing slowly!</p>
                                        <p>The terrifying pressure was crushing down upon both Zhou Weiqing and Gu
                                            Yingbing, draining their energy at a crazy rate. When Zhou Weiqing staggered
                                            back a step, he felt as if he could no longer hold on. However, after moving
                                            back one more step, he finally stopped staggering back just like that.
                                            Although he was still having trouble holding on, at least he had finally
                                            stabilized himself and not lost just immediately.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, even the Tiger King Xue Aoying couldn’t help but reveal a
                                            hint of admiration on his face. For a six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master,
                                            even with the aid of the Demonic Change State, to be able to withstand a Mid
                                            Level Heavenly Emperor Stage Heavenly Beast for so long, it was already
                                            unbelievably astonishing. He could imagine that any other six-Jeweled
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master would have already imploded internally from facing
                                            such pressure. After all, the gap in cultivation level was just too
                                            huge.</p>
                                        <p>*Haaahhh* Gu Yingbing yelled softly in exertion as his arms raised up
                                            abruptly, palms facing upwards. The next moment, the golden-red light around
                                            his body actually turned pure golden, as if flames rising into the air.</p>
                                        <p>Divine Flames. This was not any Skill, but the pure merger of Heavenly Energy
                                            of the Divine and Fire Attribute merging together fully. This was also one
                                            of the ultimate secrets of the Heavenly Snow Mountain that was never to be
                                            passed outside. With the sheer power of the Divine Flames, Gu Yingbing
                                            finally managed to hold his ground, but his Heavenly Energy expenditure was
                                            now several times his original.</p>
                                        <p>Gu Yingbing finally had a moment of respite to turn to look at Zhou Weiqing.
                                            In his mind, Zhou Weiqing could not possibly hold on for five minutes.
                                            Although the Divine Flames was a huge drain on himself, he was confident of
                                            at least holding on for that long, and without question that would put him
                                            as the ultimate victor.</p>
                                        <p>However, a shocking sight followed next. Just as everyone thought the swaying
                                            body of Zhou Weiqing would fall, abruptly a tearing sound rang out, and the
                                            back of Zhou Weiqing’s shirt ripped apart in a burst. A pair of huge wings
                                            sprang forth from his back without warning.</p>
                                        <p>The black grey wings were like an artifact calming the seas. When they
                                            appeared, the massive amounts of various energies suddenly started surging
                                            crazily towards Zhou Weiqing. At the same time, it was as if Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            bloodline aura abruptly raised up to an even higher state. Although his
                                            cultivation level was still the same, the gap between them still like an
                                            unbreachable chasm, his bloodline aura was suddenly at a massive advantage
                                            against the Snow Lord Mammoths!</p>
                                        <p>Using bloodline alone to suppress a Heavenly Emperor Stage Snow Lord Mammoth
                                            of noble blood!??</p>
                                        <p>Both the Tiger King and Lion King widened their eyes. This time, as Xue
                                            AoTian saw the wings spreading out from Zhou Weiqing’s back, even he was not
                                            able to maintain his impassive expression.</p>
                                        <p>Paired wings that could actually upgrade one’s bloodline?! What the h*** was
                                            going on?!</p>
                                        <p>In that instant, Xue AoTian suddenly realised that he had severely
                                            underestimated that ancient tiger bloodline of Zhou Weiqing’s. He had
                                            previously thought he had already judged it very highly, but it appeared it
                                            wasn’t as simple as he thought… perhaps… it was even at a far higher level
                                            than his own bloodline… a nobler and higher grade than even the Divine
                                            Heavenly Spirit Tigers!</p>
                                        <p>As soon as the wings burst forth from Zhou Weiqing’s back, shock filled the
                                            eyes of Snow Lord Mammoth in front of him. Abruptly, the pressure on Zhou
                                            Weiqing almost halved, and in the short instantaneous respite, Zhou Weiqing
                                            had actually taken a huge step forward, regaining the footing lost
                                            previously.</p>
                                        <p>Black and grey light swirled around him as if burning into the air. It was a
                                            mix of his Darkness and Demonic Attributes.</p>
                                        <p>The Divine Attribute and Demonic Attribute were both Saint Attributes, and it
                                            was hard to compare which was stronger than the other. However, if one
                                            compared Darkness and Fire Attribute, there was an obvious difference. Zhou
                                            Weiqing had somehow managed to just use his Demonic Change State to somehow
                                            merge his Darkness and Demonic Attributes, fusing them perfectly like the
                                            Divine Flames of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. All this without any secret
                                            arts! This was the advantage of his bloodline power!</p>
                                        <p>The Dark Demon God Tiger was originally of the Darkness, Demonic and
                                            Lightning Attributes, and had full control over all these Attributes, able
                                            to merge them easily. As such, under the Demonic Change State, instinctively
                                            having them fuse together was not that difficult a task.</p>
