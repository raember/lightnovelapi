                                        <p>Regarding the Peerless Battalion, the WanShou Empire were definitely well
                                            prepared. After all, when the Swift Wolf Regiment’s Commander Butler was
                                            wounded, the Heavenly Snow Mountain had learned about it. Furthermore, the
                                            other Wolf Cavalry Regiment and Unicorn Cavalry Regiment had been critically
                                            damaged previously, how could the Peerless Battalion not stirred up the full
                                            attention of the WanShou Empire? The two Eagle Tribesmen Regiment were
                                            specially sent to take care of the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>However, the WanShou Empire had made a mistake… an error in judgement
                                            regarding the true numbers of the Peerless Battalion. According to their
                                            reports, the Peerless Battalion numbered about a normal Battalion and maybe
                                            a little more. How could they possibly know that the Peerless Battalion had
                                            long since grown to more than five thousand men!</p>
                                        <p>As they watched the incoming flying air troops, the Drunken Rogue Luo Ke Di
                                            said with a strange expression on his face: “Those… in the skies… they are
                                            here for us right?”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng said with an ugly expression on his face: “What else could it be.
                                            Heavy Infantry Regiment, prepare a defensive formation against the top.
                                            Everyone, slow down, safety first.”</p>
                                        <p>The two Battalions of Eagle Tribesmen Air Force had come just too quickly.
                                            Before the Peerless Battalion could even reach the left wing, they had
                                            already risen into the air, and a rain of arrows descended from the skies,
                                            targeting the Peerless Battalion. The titanium mail of the Peerless
                                            Battalion might be strong, but their brilliant glow was also rather obvious,
                                            making them an easy target visually.</p>
                                        <p>Without hesitation, the Peerless Battalion soldiers raised their Consolidated
                                            Bows and returned fire. Alas, much to their vexation, even with their
                                            archery skills and powerful Consolidated Bows, it was extremely difficult to
                                            strike a target in mid air especially at the height of more than a thousand
                                            metres… even if they found their mark, many of them had lost momentum and
                                            were easily batted aside by the claws of the War Eagles.</p>
                                        <p>Along with the string of *ding**ding**dang**dang* sounds of metal clashing on
                                            metal, the Heavy Infantry Regiment soldiers’ towwer shields easily blocked
                                            the rain of arrows from the skies. However, the next salvo that descended
                                            was no longer arrows, but the javelins thrown down from above.</p>
                                        <p>The *ding**dang* sounds warped into a thunderous roar. If the previous rain
                                            of arrows could perhaps be said to be easily blocked by the Peerless
                                            Battalion titanium mail alone, the javelins would have totally destroyed
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, everybody, including Hua Feng, felt an unbelievable sense of
                                            admiration and respect for Zhou Weiqing. His foresight and preparation in
                                            this… had indeed avoided the greatest critical danger to the Peerless
                                            Battalion since it was set up.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander, let my First Main Company go up and greet them. Air
                                            force against air force… we can teach them a lesson.” Lei Zi piped out.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng glanced at him and said: “Stop talking rubbish, listen to orders.
                                            You want your men to fly up and give their lives for nothing? They already
                                            have the high ground advantage far above us… before you all can even get
                                            halfway the distance to them, their javelins would have nailed you all.”</p>
                                        <p>The momentum of falling from a thousand metres height… let alone being thrown
                                            at full strength, even the thick tower shields were dented from the sheer
                                            smashing impact. Even though the First Main Company were the top elites of
                                            the Peerless Battalion and wearing their titanium mail, if they were not
                                            careful they could be totally wiped out. The Peerless Battalion could not
                                            afford such a major loss! As such, Hua Feng definitely would not take such a
                                            massive risk. Zhou Weiqing had left him with a Peerless Battalion at full
                                            strength, and he wanted to return it to his command in perfect
                                            condition.</p>
                                        <p>Mu En sidled up closer to Hua Feng and said softly: “Let’s wait a while, let
                                            them continue throwing the javelins. I do not believe that they can hold
                                            that many of such javelins on an airborne mount. Once they have finished
                                            throwing all their javelins… then we can deal with them. For now, we can
                                            just be careful and go according to our original plan to deal with the
                                            Unicorn Cavalry Regiment… and catch us some Unicorn Heavenly Beasts.”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng exchanged a look with Mu En, an appreciative look of two cunning
                                            geniuses recognizing and appreciating each other. Very soon, he issued out a
                                            series of orders down. The Heavy Infantry soldiers lifted up their thick and
                                            heavy tower shields in an interlocking formation towards the skies, forming
                                            an impenetrable from above. Under the protection of such a moving metal
                                            fortress, the Peerless Battalion ignored the threat of the airborne Eagle
                                            Tribe Battalions, instead continuing to move slowly and steadily towards the
                                            left flank, though they had slowed down by a lot.</p>
                                        <p>Just like what Mu En had said, the javelins of the Eagle Tribesmen soldiers
                                            were extremely limited, and they could not possibly continue such an
                                            onslaught forever. After several rounds of the javelins raining down, they
                                            slowed down and stopped, seeking a better opportunity to take out the
                                            Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Very quickly, the Peerless Battalion reached the left flank. Instantly, the
                                            shrill cries of arrows in flight rang out once more. The Eagle Tribesmen
                                            soldiers above were extremely vexed to see from their vantage point wave
                                            after wave of arrows fly out towards their allies, and accompanying the
                                            shrill cries they could only watch and see the Dog Tribe Scimitar Infantry
                                            Regiment soldiers and Unicorn Cavalry soldiers get mowed down like wheat
                                            during harvest season.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of continued sustained fighting capabilities in the air, the
                                            Peerless Battalion was undoubtedly no match for the Eagle Tribesmen
                                            Battalions. After all, the Eagle Tribesmen were mounted upon their trust War
                                            Eagles and had their support. However, in terms of sheer destructive power,
                                            being all Jewel Masters with Consolidated Bows, the Peerless Battalion was
                                            far beyond the Eagle Tribesmen Air Force.</p>
                                        <p>As the slaughter started once again, Hua Feng stealthily called Lei Zi to his
                                            side and gave him some instructions in a low tone. Soon after, the Peerless
                                            Battalion First Main Company stopped their firing, lying low under the
                                            protection of the Heavy Infantry soldiers as they took a rest, recovering
                                            their Heavenly Energy as they prepared for the next incoming order.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since the Eagle Tribesmen Regiment was set up, it could be said that
                                            everything had gone smoothly for them, and they had never been defeated in
                                            battle. Currently, they were actually being blocked by the tower shields of
                                            the Heavy Infantry Soldiers, how could they not be furious. Another flurry
                                            of javelins and arrows descended from the skies; alas the force from the
                                            arrows was insufficient, and while the javelins were rather powerful, and
                                            even for the Heavy Infantry soldiers’ strength and physique, being struck by
                                            them continuously was almost too much for them, having to make use of the
                                            interlocking formation to rest their tower shields on the edge of their
                                            companions to increase the holding power. As a result, the firing of the
                                            Peerless Battalion was affected, and their offensive power dropped
                                            somewhat.</p>
                                        <p>Beastmen Warriors did not fear death, and in this moment, it was truly
                                            displayed out. Although the Peerless Battalion had slain quite a number,
                                            they still continued charging in an ever greater frenzy. From the ten
                                            Regiments at the back, four more charged out. Amongst them, two charged
                                            directly to the right wing to replace the charge there. As for the other
                                            two, they headed to the left wing to reinforce it. Of the two headed to the
                                            left wing, one was particularly attention catching.</p>
                                        <p>This Regiment obviously did not number ten thousand. To be more accurate,
                                            they only numbered that of a Battalion, yet, they were considered an entire
                                            Legion within the army.</p>
                                        <p>They were all over four metres tall, their muscles bulging far beyond even
                                            that of those Bear Tribe Heavy Infantry Soldiers. They all had brownish
                                            yellow hair, and as they started charging from a distance, the entire earth
                                            seemed to shake, the pounding reverberating through the ground like an
                                            earthquake, from far to near as they charged at a speed belying their huge
                                            forms.</p>
                                        <p>The Mammoth Regiment, the ultimate elite and ace of the WanShou Empire. In
                                            the entire WanShou Empire, the number of Mammoth Berserkers only totalled
                                            two thousand forming two Regiments of a thousand each. The reason why they
                                            were still known as a Regiment even though they only numbered a thousand was
                                            because even with such a number their combat strength was beyond ten
                                            thousand of any other Beastman Tribe.</p>
                                        <p>The Mammoth Berserkers were known as the meat grinders of the battlefield.
                                            Their weapons were Mammoth Totemic Poles over six metres long and with a
                                            diameter of about half a metre. They were crafted from a unique wood from
                                            the north, known as the Metal Strength Wood, and each weighed over a
                                            thousand jin.</p>
                                        <p>Every time the Mammoth Berserker Warriors appeared on the battlefield of the
                                            north, it would normally be in the Central North lines, and they would be
                                            met by the ZhongTian Heavenly Jewel Master Battalion. In terms of Beastmen
                                            soldiers and their individual personal strengths, the Mammoth Beastmen could
                                            be said to be at the very top.</p>
                                        <p>The WanShou Empire armies had controlled any spread of news just too
                                            perfectly, and up until the point that the Mammoth Berserker Regiment
                                            entered the battlefield, only then did the ZhongTian Northwest Armies learn
                                            that the WanShou Empire had actually dispatched this terrifying force to
                                            this side.</p>
                                        <p>For the Peerless Battalion, the WanShou Empire had actually sent out both
                                            their aces, the Eagle Tribe and Mammoth Tribe Regiments… one could see the
                                            sheer importance they placed on the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, as the WanShou Empire started their own movement of troops, the
                                            ZhongTian empire side were not idle. Previously, the Peerless Battalion had
                                            cleared out all the enemies on the left flank, and it was a huge disruption
                                            to the WanShou Empire’s attack and formations, and it stabilized their own
                                            defensive formations.</p>
                                        <p>On the right flank, they swiftly reinforced with a Heavenly Infantry Regiment
                                            and two ordinary Infantry Regiments, while the center lines were also
                                            reinforced with two Heavy Infantry soldiers to help hold back the defensive
                                            formation, blocking the crazed onslaught from the Tyrannical Bear Regiment
                                            and the two Raging Bull Regiments.</p>
                                        <p>The strongest reaction was naturally to the left flank, where three entire
                                            Heavy Cavalry Regiments charged to reinforce it. That was not all; with
                                            another Cavalry Regiment riding to join in, dressed fully in a light mail,
                                            wearing helmets with purple red coloured tassels. Their speed was extremely
                                            fast, and they soon reached quickly. They were all wielding long spears, and
                                            amazingly, all the javelins and arrows that rained down from above were
                                            easily dodged or parried with those spears. The WanShou Empire had their ace
                                            forces, how could the ZhongTian Empire not have their own ace up the sleeve?
                                            This Purple Tasseled Regiment was Admiral Brando’s Personal Guard Regiment,
                                            and they were the finest elite force in the entire Northwest Armies.</p>
                                        <p>With the Purple Tasseled Regiment at the lead, supplemented by the three
                                            other Heavy Cavalry Regiments, their only goal now was to protect the
                                            Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>No matter what they thought about the Peerless Battalion or their previous
                                            actions, when they heard the shrill cries of the arrows and the effect of
                                            their slaughter of the enemies, all the Northwest Army forces couldn’t help
                                            but feel respect for them. Even the Purple Tasseled Regiment would not dare
                                            to boast of such unbelievable offensive capabilities.</p>
                                        <p>After so many years of warring against the WanShou Empire, both small and
                                            large scale battles alike, but for the ZhongTian Empire, for them to
                                            actually kill off almost two entire Regiments of Beastmen soldiers was
                                            nearly unheard of totally. Yet, just the five thousand soldiers of the
                                            Peerless Battalion had already nearly wiped out three whole Battalions of
                                            WanShou Empire armies since winter had begun, and it looked like the number
                                            was steadily increasing.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander, Tribe Leader Ma Long has brought his Berserker Tribe
                                            brothers to the front lines.” One of the Peerless Battalion soldiers ran
                                            over to report to Hua Feng.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng nodded and said: “Tell Tribe Leader Ma Long not to rush to join the
                                            battle. Ask him to wait for us to start suppressing the Eagle Tribe Regiment
                                            before they head out to collect those Unicorn Heavenly Beasts.</p>
                                        <p>As the Peerless Battalion entered the fray, the Dog Tribesmen Infantry
                                            soldiers and Unicorn Cavalry soldiers were starting to sustain heavy
                                            injuries and casualties, and from the looks of things, they would not be
                                            able to hold on for long.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the Mammoth Regiment and the supporting Nimble Panther
                                            Regiment still had some distance to close before reaching the front lines.
                                            It was clear that they would not be in time to reinforce the now-belaboured
                                            left flank.</p>
                                        <p>The battle had already entered a white hot stage, and every minute both sides
                                            lost large amounts of soldiers, leaving their lives forever on this
                                            battleground. By now, the total kill-count of the entire Peerless Battalion
                                            alone had already surpassed the grand total of all the other ZhongTian
                                            Empire Northwest Armies added together. On the left flank, besides the Eagle
                                            Tribesmen Air Force Regiment, the rest of the WanShou Empire armies were on
                                            the verge of breakdown.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander, please let us set out now!”</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi urged Hua Feng to give the order, rather impatiently.</p>
                                        <p></p>
