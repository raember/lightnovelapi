                                            who had entered the top eight, not all of them were happy and excited. Of
                                            course, the easiest example would be the Dan Dun Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>Although they had entered the top eight, their vice leader Han Bing had died
                                            at Fei Li Battle Team’s Han Bing’s hands, and although Shen Little Demon had
                                            survived, she was still currently in the midst of recovering and would not
                                            be able to fight.</p>
                                        <p>Normally, the top eight quarterfinals fight would not have any surprise
                                            factors, but this year, it seemed like it would be different. Once again,
                                            citizens and visitors flocked to the ZhongTian Plaza early in the morning, a
                                            much larger crowd than normal. After all, it had been many decades since
                                            there had been any change in the top four teams, and today, perhaps history
                                            would be in the making. All of them wanted to witness this miraculous
                                            event.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, the Fei Li Battle Team’s popularity had risen to the top.
                                            After defeating the Dan Dun Battle Team, in the eyes of the ordinary
                                            audience, they were a miraculous team that could definitely beat this
                                            relatively unknown team of the Kalise Empire to enter the top four, to
                                            create a legend of the first team outside of the four seeded teams to enter
                                            the top four in the last few centuries.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, even the ZhongTian Empire officials seemed to think the same, as the
                                            betting on their match was closed, as it seemed like they did not want to
                                            lose out on this seemingly sure-win match. Of course, perhaps Zhou Weiqing
                                            winning a hundred million gold coins had something to do with that
                                            decision.</p>
                                        <p>Many of the surrounding Rest Houses were already empty; after the preliminary
                                            heats, the Battle Teams which did not enter the top eight were still allowed
                                            to stay and watch the last quarterfinals fight, but many of the eliminated
                                            teams had not chosen to do so, choosing to leave instead. After all, they
                                            had not entered the top eight, why stay and look at proof of their
                                            embarrassment?</p>
                                        <p>In the Dan Dun Battle Team Rest House.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Little Demon still sat on the prime seat, her face an unhealthy pale
                                            complexion as she stared out of the Rest House. Looking at the bright
                                            sunshine and clear skies, a bitter smile crossed her lips. If the weather
                                            had been like this the other day, how could she possibly let that fellow win
                                            so easily like that?</p>
                                        <p>As she thought up to that point, she gave a slight shudder as she couldn’t
                                            help but recall the Dark Demon God Lightning and the feeling as it struck
                                            her. If she had to describe it, it would be all pervasive, invasive,
                                            terrifying.</p>
                                        <p>Although her Holy Flames of Light had already taken out a major bite of the
                                            Dark Demon God Lightning, and weakened it considerably, that deceptively
                                            small but savagely powerful attack had still landed on her, unblocked by her
                                            own powerful strike.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Little Demon could still clearly remember how she felt the instant the
                                            Dark Demon God Lightning struck. At first, all she felt was cold, a bone
                                            chilling cold that was at its maximum. What followed next was a total
                                            darkness over her eyes, as she felt as if her meridians and internal organs
                                            were about to explode. That was the last thing she felt before she was
                                            knocked out, and the next thing she knew, she had awoken in her hotel
                                            bed.</p>
                                        <p>The other Dan Dun Battle Team members did not try to hide the process of her
                                            healing from her, and she was told everything that had happened since she
                                            lost the fight. Towards Zhou Weiqing, she definitely did not have any shred
                                            of gratitude, just a strong hatred and anger. However, she knew that with
                                            Shangguan Longyin’s promise, she definitely could not take revenge, to repay
                                            his ‘kindness’ with ingratitude. Of course, the current Dan Dun Battle Team
                                            did not have the power to even contemplate taking revenge, and they could
                                            only wait til they returned to the Blood Red Hell before seeing what could
                                            be done.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, a venomous look entered her eyes uncontrollably as she
                                            clenched her fists. <i>Han Bing, do not worry. No matter what, I will take
                                                help you take revenge.</i></p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, Lan Feng, who had been standing at the entrance of the Rest
                                            House, suddenly said softly: “They are here.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Little Demon’s eyes shot wide open, her pupils narrowing as she took a
                                            step forward, seeing the Fei Li Battle Team members enter their Rest
                                            House.</p>
                                        <p>Subconsciously, her fists clenched again, and she gritted her teeth as her
                                            gaze fixed upon Zhou Weiqing. She could not forget the two large dark
                                            bruises forming palm marks on her chest that she saw when she awoke from her
                                            injuries…</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing did not really do anything to her, it was because the
                                            Dark Demon God Lightning’s venom had been drawn out from there, causing the
                                            mark to form. Of course, that little rascal had obviously touched her there,
                                            and it was no wonder she hated him.</p>
                                        <p>“Leader, what will our formation and strategy be today?” Lan Feng asked
                                            carefully.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing him mention today’s fight, Shen Little Demon’s body wavered a little.
                                            To the Dan Dun Battle Team, after losing to the Fei Li Battle Team in the
                                            preliminary heats, they were out of luck as they would definitely have to
                                            face one of the other seeded teams in today’s quarterfinal fights. Alas,
                                            their streak of bad luck had continued… as they had drawn the WanShou Battle
                                            Team. The WanShou Battle Team had always been the champion for many years of
                                            the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and were definitely the last opponent they
                                            would want.</p>
                                        <p>As a team leader of a seeded team, Shen Little Demon was extremely clear that
                                            they would not have any hopes of victory against either the WanShou Battle
                                            Team or the ZhongTian Battle Team, as those two were usually the last two
                                            fighting for the champion spot in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament.
                                            Furthermore, the entire WanShou Battle Team main members were all of the six
                                            Jeweled cultivation level!</p>
                                        <p>“There is no need to arrange any strategy. We will surrender without
                                            fighting. I will take full responsibility for our loss this time.” After
                                            saying that, Shen Little Demon turned around resolutely and walked back into
                                            the Rest House. Before doing so, she glared angrily at Zhou Weiqing more, as
                                            if trying to imprint his features into her mind.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, no one ever pays attention to the losers, and the glory is always on
                                            the victor.</p>
                                        <p>The Dan Dun Battle Team were not the only people looking at the Fei Li Battle
                                            Team. No matter the VIP Stage, other Battle Teams and even the audience,
                                            many of them were examining this ‘upstart’ team.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch walked directly to the Fei Li Battle Team, dressed in a Fei Li
                                            Battle Team uniform that she had actually ordered and bought specially,
                                            before sitting down right beside Zhou Weiqing. Currently, she kept her
                                            mischevious side well hidden, looking like a noble young lady, innocent and
                                            harmless to the core. Such a skilled acting, she was no lesser than Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>When Little Witch showed up early in the morning at their hotel wearing their
                                            Fei Li Battle Team uniform to look for them, the last worries in their
                                            hearts fell away and dissipated. No matter what, Little Witch was of high
                                            rank and status in the Heavenly Demon Sect, and there was no need for her to
                                            act like this just to try and cheat the Fei Li Battle Team. After all, in a
                                            true fight between both sides, no one could be a hundred percent confident
                                            of victory.</p>
                                        <p>As Shangguan Tianxin proclaimed the start of the quarterfinals, it all
                                            officially began. Alas, it was as if fate had designed that the day would
                                            not be an exciting day, and as soon as the fights started, the first two
                                            were disappointing direct surrenders, much to the dismay of the entire
                                            crowd.</p>
                                        <p>Kalise Battle Team. Surrender.</p>
                                        <p>Dan Dun Battle Team. Surrender.</p>
                                        <p>As such, the Fei Li Battle Team and WanShou Battle Team both won without a
                                            fight, entering the top four easily. The next two fights were almost just as
                                            unexciting, almost boring. The ZhongTian Battle Team showed their
                                            overbearing power, only sending out a single member to finish the entire
                                            fight. Under the elimination system of the quarterfinals, he destroyed all
                                            five of his opponents easily, and their team got through without any
                                            hiccups.</p>
                                        <p>As for the last seeded team, the BaoPo Battle Team, backed by the Great Saint
                                            Land Passion Valley, they also showed their power, managing to win easily
                                            with only two team members. The day ended with two surrenders and two
                                            overwhelming victories, and the entire process was rather boring for the
                                            audience.</p>
                                        <p>As such, the quarterfinals ended in less than half a day, and the final
                                            result was the ZhongTian Battle Team, WanShou Battle Team, BaoPo Battle Team
                                            and the Fei Li Battle Team ascending to the top four.</p>
                                        <p>Although they had won without a fight, the entire Fei Li Battle Team members
                                            were filled with excitement. Top Four! By entering the top four, they had
                                            already created history, and would become heroes in the Fei Li Empire! Even
                                            Little Witch couldn’t hide her excitement. After all, it had been several
                                            decades since the Heavenly Demon Sect had last been able to enter the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island, and she had at least successfully completed her
                                            mission.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin walked out from the VIP stage, walking directly from the
                                            top onto the air as if there were some invisible steps in midair, walking
                                            slowly step by step towards the tournament stage in the center of the grand
                                            Plaza.</p>
                                        <p>“ZhongTian, WanShou, BaoPo, Fei Li Battle Teams, the four of you have entered
                                            the top four. Tomorrow morning, please report to the Skill Storing Palace to
                                            receive your Heavenly Jewel Plaque. We will then head to the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Island in preparation for the next stage of the Tournament, and the rules
                                            and format of the latter portion of the Tournament will be announced in the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island.” Shangguan Longyin announced in his deep voice to the
                                            crowd.</p>
                                        <p>“We did it! We did it! We’re actually in the top four! Wahahaha---!” The
                                            excited Fei Li Battle Team members had been controlling themselves the
                                            entire morning, and they were finally able to leap up in excitement. Excited
                                            cheers erupted from all their mouths, and even Little Witch was no
                                            exception.</p>
                                        <p>The past weeks through the entire tournament had definitely been a huge
                                            stress and toll on all of them, even the two members Xiao Yan and Drunken
                                            Bao who had not truly fought in any of the fights had been because of their
                                            severe injuries when meeting Little Witch on the road to the ZhongTian City.
                                            It could be said that, the entire Fei Li Battle Team had taken a huge toll
                                            in injuries throughout the course of their entire run, with Little Four and
                                            Zhou Weiqing both almost dying in their fights. It could be said that almost
                                            every step they took to get ahead in this Tournament had been fraught with
                                            peril and difficulty!</p>
                                        <p>However, the moment they heard Shangguan Longyin’s proclamation, the previous
                                            bitterness, difficulty and pain seemed to all fall away. In their hearts,
                                            there was only pride and excitement. It had all been worth it. Top four, it
                                            was a rank that belonged to them, to the Fei Li Empire!</p>
                                        <p>The other three seeded teams looked silently at the crazed members of the Fei
                                            Li Battle Team. None of them could mock their almost exaggerated cheers and
                                            celebrations. Indeed, for the Fei Li Battle Team to have done what they did,
                                            they indeed deserved their pride.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo held out his hands, and everyone piled their palms onto his.
                                            Looking at their leader’s red eyes, all of them followed suit as their
                                            emotions were carried along in the wave of happiness and excitement.</p>
                                        <p>With a loud cry, Lin TianAo exclaimed: “Tonight, we shall not return unless
                                            we are drunk!”</p>
                                        <p>Top Four! Even if it was ‘just’ the top four, they had already written a new
                                            page in the history books of the Fei Li Empire, a page that would shock the
                                            annals of the Fei Li Empire, and perhaps unrepeatable! Not just the history
                                            of the Fei Li Empire, but even perhaps the entire Mainland!</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>That night, the bunch of fellows with too much surplus excited energy drank
                                            out nearly half of their inn’s alcohol, before falling in a dead drunk
                                            stupor.</p>
                                        <p>When they first met, Zhou Weiqing, Ye Paopao and Shangguan Bing’er had been
                                            there as the substitute members, and they had been rather rejected and
                                            looked down upon. Of course, after that bet, and as they slowly showed their
                                            abilities and strength, they were slowly accepted by the main members of the
                                            Fei Li Battle Team, and their relationship had grown from there.</p>
                                        <p>By the time the Heavenly Jewel Tournament had began, their cohesiveness,
                                            teamwork and friendship had grown bit by bit with every day they spent
                                            together, every fight, until now, when they were almost a single unit.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Dawn.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing slowly awoke from his sleep. His body was rather different from
                                            an ordinary person, especially after several evolving, and was even stronger
                                            than any other Heavenly Jewel Master of the same cultivation level. As such,
                                            he had a much stronger resistance against any ‘poisons’, and a much stronger
                                            recovery rate, and alcohol was no different. Although they had binged so
                                            much the night before, he still awoke on the break of dawn.</p>
                                        <p><i>Eh? Why is my arm feeling so numb?</i></p>
                                        <p></p>
