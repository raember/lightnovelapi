                                        <p>Still in mid air, Zhou Weiqing forcibly turned his body, the Overlord Bow in
                                            his right hand, while his left hand slid forth and waved at the incoming
                                            shadow. In a flash of silver light, a large, three yard wide tear in the air
                                            appeared below his feet.</p>
                                        <p>As the black shadow clashed with the rift, an earsplitting sound rang out in
                                            the plaza. At that point, Jiang Fei’s Darkness Skill, and its terrifying
                                            offense, was displayed in its full glory. Even facing Zhou Weiqing’s Spatial
                                            Rend, her Sealing Technique was still not disrupted. Although a portion of
                                            it vanished into a puff of black smoke, some of it managed to get around the
                                            Spatial Rift, continuing to chase Zhou Weiqing. The strangest thing was
                                            that, as they passed each other, it seemed to leave a black stain in the
                                            air, as if even though weakened by the Spatial Rend, it had left its mark in
                                            the air.</p>
                                        <p>If Zhou Weiqing had been at the same cultivation level as Jiang Fei, at five
                                            Jewels, even without any boost from Consolidated Equipment, his King Stage
                                            Skill Spatial Rend would definitely be able to block her Darkness Sealing
                                            Technique. Alas, the difference in power levels and Heavenly Energy quality
                                            was just too great, and even the King Stage Spatial Rend was unable to
                                            completely dissipate the attack.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, two consecutive explosions rang out, as Crow had
                                            finally reached Wu Zhengyang in her charge, under the cover of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s arrows. Having fought with him earlier, she knew that he was no
                                            pushover and she immediately released her legendary axes and swung them
                                            savagely at his shield of light.</p>
                                        <p>Wu Zhengyang was at the four-Jeweled cultivation level, one Jewel more than
                                            Crow, but how could Crow’s attacks be looked upon with ordinary logic. With
                                            the legendary axes each weighing more than a thousand jin, along with her
                                            terrifying strength, what sort of power did that hold?</p>
                                        <p>Even though Zhou Weiqing had his pair of legendary Consolidated Equipment
                                            Hammers, but their main strength was from their set bonuses, various imbued
                                            buffs as well as their boost to Elemental Skills. Without making use of any
                                            skills, and just in terms of pure physical combat, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            definitely sure that his plain attacks were not comparable in any way to
                                            Crow.</p>
                                        <p>Despite the fact that the Shimmering Light Shield had an impressive defense,
                                            cracks still appeared upon it when Crow’s first blow chopped down hard. As
                                            her second axe landed on it, it wavered as more cracks appeared, and was
                                            clearly on the verge of breaking.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the ZhongTian Emperor, Shangguan Tianxin, who was seated
                                            comfortably in the VIP stand, smiled faintly as he said: “These two
                                            three-Jeweled little fellows are very interesting. To be able to see the
                                            Spatial Rend Skill here, impressive. And that little girl with the huge
                                            physique… that pair of axes aren’t ordinary as well. As for that little girl
                                            from the Mi’Ou Empire, she is impressive herself, her power levels is almost
                                            at our ZhongTian reserve team level.”</p>
                                        <p>Jing Fei did not look at Zhou Weiqing, nor did she hesitate a moment. Right
                                            after her second round of attacks targeted at Crow was once again disrupted
                                            by Zhou Weiqing, she launched a third salvo, still the five balls of black
                                            light as before. However, this time, it would not be as easy for Zhou
                                            Weiqing to disrupt the attack, as he was now facing the threat of the black
                                            shadow nipping at his heels.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the easiest, and perhaps best solution for Zhou Weiqing was
                                            undoubtedly to use the Blink Skill to avoid the shadow; that way, even if it
                                            continued chasing him, he would still have time to plan and react. However,
                                            if he did that, Crow would have to face the two opponents by herself during
                                            the period when Zhou Weiqing was dealing with the shadow. As such, Zhou
                                            Weiqing ignored that easy option, and instead did something that no one else
                                            understood.</p>
                                        <p>Still in midair, Zhou Weiqing stopped dodging and running, instead using his
                                            right leg to kick at the shadow, as if doing so in a subconscious movement.
                                            At the same time, he swiftly shot an arrow into the air. It was already too
                                            late for him to shoot five arrows to block the five black balls speeding
                                            towards Crow, but he had his own plans to deal with that.</p>
                                        <p>The remaining shadows instantly swarmed into Zhou Weiqing’s right leg,
                                            without making a sound. At the other end, Jiang Fei’s mouth curled up into a
                                            smile. In her eyes, Zhou Weiqing was finished; without her help, he would
                                            not be able to break free of that, and with that skill, she could even take
                                            his life. Of course, she did not think of killing Zhou Weiqing, but would
                                            wait until the fights were all over before she would help him remove the
                                            seal, also known as the Necrosis Decay Seal.</p>
                                        <p>At the other side, the five balls of black light had reached Crow, just as
                                            she had finished her second blow and destroyed the shield of light.</p>
                                        <p>Jiang Fei had supreme confidence in her Skill. Not to mention a three-Jeweled
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master, even a similar five-Jeweled Master would be hard
                                            pressed to take on her fully boosted Skills head on. After all, the Darkness
                                            Attribute’s greatest strength was its continuous and sustained attacks; once
                                            it hit, its destructive capabilities would last for quite a long time.</p>
                                        <p>“Heaven Destruction!” Crow shouted out loud, and the two legendary axes in
                                            her hands suddenly glowed in a brilliant maleficent crimson light. At the
                                            same time, her sleeves evaporated as her muscles bulged out, and it could
                                            clearly be seen on her large arms a blood-red glow similarly shine forth. As
                                            she swung the axes, the red glow followed, dancing around eerily as they
                                            slashed through the air, striking hard into the five balls of black light
                                            which were actually smashed apart, losing control and falling to the
                                            ground.</p>
                                        <p>An earsplitting *chih chih* sound rang out, as the black balls of light fell
                                            onto the ground one by one. The tough diamond rock was actually dissolved in
                                            a one yard diameter for each ball, causing a huge hole to form in the stage,
                                            and it was spreading wider.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, Crow turned to smash her glowing red axes into the shield of
                                            light once more, and in a large explosion, the shield of light shattered,
                                            dissipating into many golden glows of light. Like a whirlwind of death, she
                                            continued charging towards Wu Zhengyang.</p>
                                        <p>On the VIP stage, when the many powerhouses saw Crow’s arms and axes glow in
                                            that sudden brilliant red light, they all exclaimed in surprise: “Blood
                                            Sacrifice Legendary Weapon?”</p>
                                        <p>Even Shangguan Tianxin’s expression changed. “No wonder I felt that the pair
                                            of axes were special, they are actually Blood Sacrifice Legendary Weapons,
                                            requiring specific bloodlines to activate. Since she is from the Fei Li
                                            Empire, and with such a physique, she must be from the Gold Crow Tribe then.
                                            Haha, this Fei Li Battle Team is quite remarkable!”</p>
                                        <p>No one had expected Crow’s sudden outburst, and Zhou Weiqing had also not
                                            expected that she would be able to break through both their opponents’
                                            attacks so easily. As such, their understanding and teamwork ran into
                                            problems. The charging Crow suddenly found herself stopped in her tracks, as
                                            a silver light enveloped her, just managing to save Wu Zhengyang, who was
                                            just about to be struck by her whirling axes.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, that skill was Zhou Weiqing’s Spatial Shackles. As it turns out, when
                                            Zhou Weiqing had been unable to take care of the last five black balls, in
                                            order to protect Crow, after releasing the arrow into the air, he had used
                                            the Spatial Shackles on her. His plan had been for the Spatial Shackles to
                                            land just as Jiang Fei’s balls struck, which would block most, if not all,
                                            of the attacks, allowing him time to react after dealing with the shadow.
                                            Unfortunately, he had not expected Crow to power through the balls so
                                            swiftly, and his Spatial Shackles ended up being more hindrance than help,
                                            causing him to stare helplessly for a split second, at a loss whether to cry
                                            or to laugh.</p>
                                        <p>*Bang* *Bang* *Bang* *Bang* The Spatial Shackles did not block Crow for long,
                                            only standing for less than two seconds before she cleaved through it with
                                            her axes with the ‘Heaven Destruction’ in effect. However, Wu Zhengyang had
                                            seized the opportunity to catch his breath, and another Shimmering Light
                                            Shield sprang up. At the same time, the Heavy Sword in his hand slashed
                                            forward, glowing with the effect of his skill as he struck towards her from
                                            behind the shield.</p>
                                        <p>At that moment, the one who was most surprised was actually Jiang Fei; not
                                            because of Crow and her arrows, but because of Zhou Weiqing. When Zhou
                                            Weiqing had landed on the ground, he had actually drawn his bow again, as if
                                            the Necrosis Decay Seal had not taken effect at all.</p>
                                        <p>However, surprise was surprise, it did not stop her from acting swiftly.
                                            Jiang Fei raised her hands once more to unleash another five balls of light.
                                            This time, it wasn’t on an attack, but floating above her head in a circle,
                                            the linking thread between them seemingly growing more solid until it seemed
                                            to form a black shield, blocking the arrow descending from the sky. Using an
                                            attack as a defense, such control over her energy and skills was indeed top
                                            quality. She knew that for Zhou Weiqing to take an attack to unleash that
                                            arrow, it definitely couldn’t be just any simple arrow.</p>
                                        <p>The truth was indeed like she expected; in shooting that arrow upwards, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had used an archery skill to extend the duration it stayed in
                                            midair, and when used as a sneak attack, it indeed would have a good
                                            effect.</p>
                                        <p>This was actually the Heavenly Bow Unit’s Transvestite Yi Shi’s secret
                                            technique, called the Sky Descent Arrow. Although Zhou Weiqing had only
                                            learnt about fifty percent of it, but its effect was not to be denied.</p>
                                        <p>*Puff* The Sky Descent Arrow fell right smack into the black shield made out
                                            of the five black balls above Jiang Fei, melting instantly. However, it
                                            still managed to released its skills.</p>
                                        <p>This arrow was what Zhou Weiqing had planned to use to turn the tides, how
                                            could it be that simple? With a huge explosion, uncountable bolts of purple
                                            blue lightning spread forth in the sky. Naturally, Jiang Fei was protected
                                            by her shield of black balls, and did not sustain any damage. With Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy, even with the explosive effect of the Overlord
                                            Bow, it could not hurt her. However, that was not the only Skill that Zhou
                                            Weiqing had socketed, nor was it only targeted at her.</p>
                                        <p>Thousand Lightning Strikes. Currently, Zhou Weiqing’s only AOE attack skill.
                                            As it exploded forth, its huge area of effect meant that Crow would actually
                                            be in the attack. However, due to the fact that it descended from the sky,
                                            it ended up behind the ‘enemy lines’. In front of Jiang Fei and Wu Zhengyang
                                            was his Shimmering Light Shield, which ended up blocking the bolts spreading
                                            out in that direction, actually protecting Crow from it! As such, the only
                                            unfortunate recipient of the entire skill was Wu Zhengyang.</p>
                                        <p>The offensive power of the Thousand Lightning Strikes was not great,
                                            especially since it was an AOE type skill. However, being struck by nearly
                                            the full impact of it, and so unexpectedly, Wu Zhengyang was still dealt a
                                            huge blow, causing his entire body to go numb, his hair standing, and a
                                            burnt smell emitting from his body.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, Jiang Fei did not go unscathed. That was because Zhou
                                            Weiqing had imbued a second skill in the arrow - Absolute Delay.</p>
                                        <p>[1. Zen's note - This is one of my favourite fights, mostly because it shows
                                            some of Zhou Weiqing's flaws, always taking things on himself instead of
                                            trusting his team mates. Also, I'm glad he f*ed up a little, since he had no
                                            prior experience coordinating with Crow or any of the other teammates thus
                                            far. ]</p>
