                                        <p>The violent, almost maniacal gaze of the male dragon fixated upon him, not
                                            hiding its hostility. However, at this moment, the mother dragon which was
                                            lying on the ground called out urgently. It even lifted up one claw in an
                                            attempt to pull her mate back, but it was just too weak at the moment, and
                                            could not even succeed in that full motion.</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing its wife’s call, the male dragon finally gave up its threatening
                                            look at Zhou Weiqing, quickly turning back to its mate. Layer after layer of
                                            Divine Attribute Heavenly Energy surged out from its body, the shining
                                            brilliant gold light rays entering the mother dragon’s body.</p>
                                        <p>With its mate’s help, the mother dragon’s eyes grew gentler, looking once
                                            more at the male dragon with much love and sentiment, its eyes slowly closed
                                            as it rested its large head upon the male dragon’s wings. Even despite that,
                                            the mother dragon did not forget the egg that had almost cost it its life,
                                            its wing wrapped protectively around it.</p>
                                        <p>This was the greatest, most selfless love in the world. The great maternal
                                            love!</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the dragon family wrapped together in such a peaceful sight, bathed in
                                            the Divine gold light, Zhou Weiqing could not help but look on with almost
                                            infatuated sentiment. He was clear that his actions today could possibly
                                            have severely offended the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and might even become a
                                            huge barrier towards himself and Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>However, he did not regret anything, especially after looking at the sight
                                            before him, he could not feel any sense of regret. He had saved a great
                                            mother. Looking at the mother dragon, he couldn’t help but think of his own
                                            mother. <i>It’s been so long since I’ve gone home… I miss mother indeed.
                                                When I get back from the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and the academy
                                                semester ends, I will definitely have to go back and look for
                                                mother. </i></p>
                                        <p>Unknowingly, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes had grown moist.</p>
                                        <p>The male dragon’s power and Divine Attribute was far beyond Tian’er, and it
                                            was a matter of moments before the mother dragon’s scales once again glowed
                                            with a healthy brilliance.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, the reason why the male dragon had been so bad tempered was
                                            because the mother dragon had been going through a terribly difficult
                                            labour, and even with all its power, it could do nothing to help its beloved
                                            mate. It was under such a circumstance that Little Four had become the first
                                            unlucky soul to be sent out of the Lustre Spatial Realm.</p>
                                        <p>The male dragon had been guarding its wife all this time with all the
                                            feelings of anxiety, and seeing that the mother dragon was about to lay her
                                            egg… their child… it had also began preparations to heal and save its mate
                                            as soon as possible. Who knew that right at that critical moment, the entire
                                            Spatial Realm had gone through a strange change, and both dragons had been
                                            brutally separated. It was also this exact coincidence that had given the
                                            ZhongTian and BaoPo Battle Team members this unheard of opportunity to take
                                            action.</p>
                                        <p>The time seemed to pass slowly in such an atmosphere. After a while, Fat Cat
                                            squirmed out of Zhou Weiqing’s Spatial Realm. When she saw that she was
                                            still in the Lustre Spatial Realm, she was given a frightening shock. Soon
                                            after, she spotted the dragon family and their condition and breathed a sigh
                                            of relief as she instantly understood what had happened.</p>
                                        <p>Morphing into her human form, Tian’er, she stood beside Zhou Weiqing and said
                                            in a soft complaint: “You are just too daring in this case.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, saying: “With the Lustre Gem, that is not
                                            really a huge risk. After all, once I used the Dragon Silencing Seal on the
                                            dragon, it wouldn’t be able to use any Skill. Of course, that won’t affect
                                            the power difference between us much, but more importantly, it will not be
                                            able to restrict me from using the Lustre Gem. In such a case, once it calms
                                            down with the help of the mother dragon, there shouldn’t be any danger. You
                                            know how scared of dying I am, this was a calculated risk that I decided to
                                            take, I would never joke around with my life!”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er held Zhou Weiqing’s arm, saying softly: “Weiqing, what you did today
                                            has truly made me look at you in a whole different light. I thank you with
                                            all my heart for what you have done for that mother dragon. If you had
                                            chosen to stand on its opposing side earlier, I truly do not know what I
                                            would have done, but I know my heart would be broken. I didn’t expect your
                                            heart would be so kindly as well. When we get out, I will definitely give
                                            you a reward.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned, saying: “Heh heh, what reward? I wouldn't mind if the
                                            reward was you!”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er rolled her eyes at him, blushing as she muttered: “You
                                            scoundrel.”</p>
                                        <p>Since the time Zhou Weiqing had met Tian’er in her human form, this was the
                                            first time he had seen her with such an almost feminine action. Added to her
                                            alluring figure, that hint of shyness and charm was definitely a ‘killing
                                            blow’.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, the male dragon sudden lifted its head and looked at
                                            Tian’er and Zhou Weiqing. Although it no longer gave off any sense of
                                            hostility, that pure powerful dragon aura still caused their hearts to skip
                                            a beat.</p>
                                        <p>“Both of you, please come over.” The deep rumbling voice seemed to come from
                                            all directions.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er continued clutching at Zhou Weiqing’s arm like a drowning man would
                                            grasp a lifesaver. Both of them could sense that the dragon did not have any
                                            hostile intent towards them, but even as they walked towards it, they felt
                                            as if their legs were wobbling.</p>
                                        <p>The two of them walked slowly to almost ten yards from the dragon family
                                            before they stopped.</p>
                                        <p>The dragon turned its gaze on Tian’er first, nodding to her as he said: “You
                                            are of the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline right. I thank you
                                            sincerely, my friend, for extending a helping hand during my wife and
                                            child’s most critical and dangerous moment. My wife told me that it was you
                                            and your kin who had helped to block our enemies’ attacks.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er let go off Zhou Weiqing’s arms and gave a respectful curtsey to it:
                                            “Honoured Senior Dragon, us Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers have always been
                                            good friends and allies to the dragon kind, and it is our duty as the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain core disciples to extend a helping hand. There is no
                                            need for thanks.”</p>
                                        <p>The male dragon turned his gaze to Zhou Weiqing, saying: “What about you
                                            then? My wife said that it was you who truly turned the tide of the battle.
                                            Although your power is extremely puny, I can still sense the aura of a
                                            Demonic Dragon Lady on you, and more so, the strange of aura of an unknown
                                            tiger… of a bloodline that even makes my heart palpitate. So, young man, why
                                            did you save my wife and child?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing knew that this male dragon was no less intelligent than any
                                            human. Its question was in itself a sort of test. If he did not answer
                                            correctly, all his previous efforts would have be for naught.</p>
                                        <p>“Hello, honoured Senior Dragon. To be honest, I have no way to answer your
                                            question, because I myself do not know why I took action. In truth, it went
                                            against all logic for me to do so, but when I saw this Senior Lady Dragon
                                            looking at her child, those eyes of hers made me think of my own mother. At
                                            that moment, I could only think that if my mother was in the same position,
                                            she would also use all of her life to protect me. So, I just wanted to do my
                                            own bit to help out. Now that your family has been reunited, it is time for
                                            us to leave then.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing grabbed hold of Tian’er’s hand and ‘pulled’ her
                                            into his Spatial Realm. Without saying anything else, he activated the
                                            Lustre Gem in his hands.</p>
                                        <p>At that moment, he was furious, because as soon as the male dragon asked the
                                            question, he knew that it suspected his motives in helping the mother
                                            dragon.</p>
                                        <p>Without a doubt, he had stayed because he had wanted to get some form of
                                            reward. That was without question. However, when he had taken action to save
                                            the mother dragon, that had not been in his mind at all.</p>
                                        <p>Now that the dragon family was reunited and safe, at least his original goal
                                            had been accomplished. Why would he need to gain anything from them? At that
                                            point, between gain and pride, Zhou Weiqing chose the latter. After all,
                                            even though he was still weak, he still had his dignity and pride.</p>
                                        <p>The male dragon started a little, then it raised its left claw swiftly. A
                                            thick gold light enveloped Zhou Weiqing, forcibly breaking the transfer of
                                            the Lustre Gem. The thirty seconds of the Dragon Silencing Seal had already
                                            long ended.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started, looking at the dragon curiously: “Senior, do you have
                                            anything else?”</p>
                                        <p>The male dragon’s gaze gentled, and it said apologetically: “I’m sorry young
                                            man, I should not have doubted your motives. You humans are just too
                                            notorious for being cunning, and it was not easy for me to trust any of
                                            you.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled passively, saying: “In any case, it is up to you to
                                            believe or not. I have never thought of myself as a good person, and all I
                                            care about is being true to myself. Senior Dragon, if there is nothing else,
                                            please allow this young junior to take his leave.”</p>
                                        <p>No matter how he seemed on the surface, that pride that Zhou Weiqing had
                                            inherited from Admiral Zhou was ingrained deep in his bones. At this point,
                                            he no longer had any intention of gaining any benefit from the male dragon;
                                            his motives had already been suspected, if he stayed to try and get anything
                                            from them, wasn’t it the same as saying that his motives was indeed
                                            impure?</p>
                                        <p>The pride in his heart made him unwilling to wait any longer, and he
                                            activated the Lustre Gem once more without hesitation.</p>
                                        <p>The dragon stared blankly as the gold light sprang forth once more. It could
                                            sense that pride in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes and countenance, his raised head and
                                            straightened back as his actions spoke the same tale as his bearing. In that
                                            instant, the powerful beast felt a strange sensation in its heart.</p>
                                        <p>This was just a mere insect-like human, but he was just so proud, not even
                                            willing to speak any further with itself.</p>
                                        <p>In the flash of gold light, just as Zhou Weiqing was about to vanish, the
                                            huge dragon seemed to make up its mind. A red bolt of light shot out from
                                            its claws, striking Zhou Weiqing’s back and forming a sigil. The next
                                            moment, Zhou Weiqing disappeared from the Lustre Spatial Realm.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had totally not seen or sensed what the dragon had done; during
                                            the entire process he had only felt a slight heat on his back before he was
                                            transported out, and in the next moment he had vanished in the gold light of
                                            the transporting Lustre Gem. He had dismissed it as part of the
                                            teleportation, but little did he know that there was now a dark red sigil on
                                            his back.</p>
                                        <p>As the Lustre Spatial Realm returned to its usual calm, the male dragon
                                            turned back its gaze to its mate, its gaze soft and gentle again. If there
                                            was anyone else there to examine it closely, he would be able to discover
                                            that one of the brightest reverse scales [1. Legend says that the few
                                            reverse scales of the dragon not only holds much its power, but it is also
                                            their weakness. If anyone touches those scales, it will be extremely
                                            provoked. Hence, the idiom 龙有逆鳞 which is exactly Dragons have reverse scales
                                            when literally translated, actually means everyone has their ‘weak point’
                                            which will enrage them if touched] around the dragon’s neck had actually
                                            disappeared.</p>
                                        <p>As the gold light flashed, the environment around Zhou Weiqing started to
                                            grow clearer, and he suddenly appeared in the shrouded portion of the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island where they had begun their journey.</p>
                                        <p>In front of Shangguan Longyin was Zhan LingTian, seated in a cross-legged
                                            meditation position.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhan LingTian had his eyes closed, his entire body covered with a
                                            layer of black-blue colour.</p>
                                        <p>Besides him, all the members of the other Battle Teams were here as well. As
                                            soon as Zhou Weiqing appeared, he immediately became the focus of the entire
                                            assembly, as everyone turned to look at him. Anger, malice, both good and
                                            bad intentions, a mass of different emotions was palpable in the air.
                                            However, Zhou Weiqing was not in a good mood, and he could not care less
                                            what the others were thinking at that moment.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing appear, Shangguan Longyin furrowed his brow before
                                            saying: “Fei Li Battle Team member, Zhou Weiqing, was the last to leave the
                                            Lustre Spatial Realm. The Heavenly Jewel Tournament champion is the Fei Li
                                            Battle Team, the second position is the WanShou Battle Team, third position
                                            the ZhongTian Battle Team, and the fourth position is the BaoPo Battle Team.
                                            This round of Heavenly Jewel Tournament is complete, you may all return to
                                            your inns to rest for now, leave your wounded here for now, I will take care
                                            of them."</p>
                                        <p>The WanShou Battle Team members glanced meaningfully at Zhou Weiqing before
                                            walking off. The BaoPo Battle Team members also took their leave, and the
                                            only remaining people there were the ZhongTian and Fei Li Battle Team
                                            members.</p>
                                        <p></p>
                                        <blockquote><em>Zen's Notes: Who else thought that Zhou Weiqing would get the
                                            baby dragon? When I first read it, I was like 'Hah! What an obvious
