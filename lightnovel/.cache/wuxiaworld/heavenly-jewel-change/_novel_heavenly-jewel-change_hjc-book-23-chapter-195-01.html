                                            increased the tax rates. All the commoners and merchants were extremely
                                            angry about it, but under military suppression, they dared not even protest.
                                            This was also the reason why the entire city had been relative quiet even
                                            after learning about the Heavenly Bow Empire’s counterattack and
                                            reoccupation.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing’s orders came into play one after the other, the citizens of
                                            the Crescent City slowly calmed down and they finally dared to come out of
                                            their houses. Without question, the Peerless Regiment soldiers had given
                                            them a very good impression in these past days.</p>
                                        <p>By the time the Kalise Empire received news about the Crescent City, it was
                                            already three days since the attack. In this three days, although Zhou
                                            Weiqing couldn’t say that he had already gained full control over the city,
                                            at least it was tentatively back in working order. Of course, that was still
                                            only within the city. For now at least, he still kept the gates sealed, not
                                            allowing anyone to leave.</p>
                                        <p>The governor’s mansion had now become Zhou Weiqing’s temporary headquarters.
                                            As for Princess Difuya, Zhou Weiqing left Xiao Yan to take care of her. As
                                            long as she did not interfere in his matters, he did not need to bother with
                                            her.</p>
                                        <p>“Commander, our scouts have spotted an entire Regiment of Kalise Empire
                                            forces camped about thirty kilometres from our Crescent City. They might
                                            attack us at anytime.” Kou Rui brought in the latest news.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Roger. Thank you. Kou Rui, bring a few
                                            brothers to detour around and scout them carefully. I want you to see the
                                            surrounding areas as well. Take care to check if they have really only sent
                                            a single Regiment.”</p>
                                        <p>Kou Rui nodded as he received the orders, leaving to execute them.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, in the main hall that they were using as an administrative
                                            assembly room, besides Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Xue’er, Tian’er, Lin TianAo,
                                            Lei Zi, Crow and Ma Qun were all there, as well as Yan Zhexi and the other
                                            elite classmates of Zhou Weiqing’s class. At this moment, Yan Zhexi had
                                            assumed temporary leadership of the class of military students.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s gaze turned to Yan Zhexi and he said: “Zhexi, what do you
                                            think about the current situation?”</p>
                                        <p>Yan Zhexi said: “From the current situation, I believe that the Kalise Empire
                                            has only sent that single Regiment. After all, the Bai Da Empire aside, the
                                            Kalise Empire only has a total army strength of ten Regiments. Furthermore,
                                            they would be separated to the various parts of the Empire, as well as their
                                            own homeland. This time, our attack must have come as a great surprise to
                                            them, and we have managed to seal any news of the attack. They should not
                                            know our current numbers or strength. I believe that we currently do not
                                            need to worry about any of their reinforcements for now. What we need to do
                                            now is to entrench ourselves and fortify our position, to defend it until
                                            the Fei Li Empire can send their logistic troops with supplies.”</p>
                                        <p>Pausing for a moment, he continued: “However, this is only a short term
                                            solution. Commander, should we begin recruiting troops? Although our army is
                                            extremely powerful, we only number seven hundred in total. If more enemies
                                            come, and that is an eventual outcome, they can attack us from all
                                            directions. Once our forces are split up, it will be extremely difficult for
                                            us to withstand a sustained attack. I propose that we begin recruiting
                                            soldiers, and with the core of the Peerless Regiment soldiers leading some
                                            new recruits on each wall, we will be able to put up a proper full
                                            defense.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Yan Zhexi’s analysis which was reasonable, clear and logical, Zhou
                                            Weiqing nodded in satisfaction as he said: “Your suggestion is not bad.
                                            However, the current hearts and minds of the people are still not
                                            stabilized, and it is not a suitable time to begin recruitment yet. In terms
                                            of military command, I am no match for you all, but do keep in mind that in
                                            the long run, the hearts and minds of the citizens is the most important. To
                                            put it simply, if you are currently just a normal citizen, and your city has
                                            just been invaded by a group of soldiers. Even if these soldiers were once
                                            belonging to the city, before you can ascertain their strength, whether or
                                            not they have a future, whether or not they can provide you with safety, to
                                            protect your city… would you actually be willing to join up with them? When
                                            the enemy comes to attack, that will be the time for us to prove ourselves
                                            and start building the Crescent City citizen’s confidence in us.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Yan Zhexi nodded slowly, as if deep in thought.
                                            At last, he asked: “In that case, Commander, what should we do?” In terms of
                                            military studies, even ten Zhou Weiqing’s could not compare with him.
                                            However, he had never been on an actual battlefield, and he definitely
                                            needed actual combat experience, to marry his theoretical knowledge along
                                            with experience to have a truly comprehensive understanding and mastery of
                                            military matters.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said confidently, as if he had already thought everything
                                            through: “Lei Zi, get some men to invite two hundred citizens as
                                            representatives. If you are not able to get enough volunteers, grab and
                                            ‘persuade’ them to do so. However, I do not want you to injure anyone. I
                                            want these two hundred citizens to be able to watch our incoming battle from
                                            a good vantage point of the city walls, so try to make sure that there are
                                            representatives from all walks of life, hopefully every trade and industry
                                            as well. Crow, Ma Qun, this is time for you to shine. If I were to get you
                                            two to lead your two hundred Tribesmen to charge and defeat an entire enemy
                                            Regiment, do you all dare to do so? Would you have confidence in
                                            victory?”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun laughed heartily and said: “Boss, in that case, does that mean that if
                                            we achieve victory, we will be able to gain a larger percentage of
                                            loot?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily as well, saying: “of course, you all will get
                                            forty percent of it all, with the rest split amongst the other five hundred
                                            brothers. I want you to achieve a resounding and beautiful victory, to
                                            charge and show the might of our Peerless Regiment. More importantly, I want
                                            the morale of our people! As for how you two wish to conduct the battle,
                                            I’ll leave it to you two to command. However, do remember not to charge into
                                            their camp, in case of any traps or unforeseen ambushes. At the same time,
                                            make sure you all do not overextend and leave energy to return safely.”</p>
                                        <p>“For the retreat, I will have our top archers to cover you. This fight, I
                                            want to build our reputation and prestige, not only to boost our morale,
                                            reputation amongst the citizens, but also to crush the enemy’s morale.”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun thumped his chest confidently. “Boss, leave it to us. Ever since our
                                            Peerless Heavy Cavalry has been set up, we have never met a fight too tough
                                            for us. Isn’t it just a Regiment? We might not be able to slaughter them
                                            all, but to charge in and out seven times[1. An idiom that references the
                                            famous scene in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel where General Zhao
                                            Yun charges seven times through the ranks of Cao Cao's armies] is not a big
                                            deal.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Very good, you two go and prepare then.”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun and Crow strode out in large steps, and Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly as
                                            he looked at the others, saying: “Come on then, brothers, follow me to the
                                            top of the city walls.”</p>
                                        <p>Yan Zhexi could not hold back, saying: “Commander, are you really asking Ma
                                            Qun and Crow to lead two hundred out of the city to attack the enemies? They
                                            have an entire Regiment!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “No matter how many ants there are, they can
                                            never kill an elephant with their bites[2. This is actually an idiom, but I
                                            was curious and went to research about <a
                                                    href="https://askentomologists.com/2015/07/01/is-there-any-truth-to-the-rumor-that-ants-eat-cows-people-and-crops/">army
                                                ants</a>, though it looks like the horror stories I heard about them
                                            were greatly exagerrated :D]. Although the current strength of our Peerless
                                            Regiment is not actually a full formation of a normal Regiment, these trash
                                            from the Kalise Empire I do not really take into account. Just wait and see,
                                            this time, you will truly witness the real strength of the Peerless Heavy
                                            Cavalry. I want the Kalise Empire to truly fear our Peerless Regiment, to
                                            tremble from just the sound of our names.”</p>
                                        <p>The last sentence, Zhou Weiqing said grimly with great resolution. He truly
                                            hated the Kalise Empire men for invading his homeland, forcing his father to
                                            use such a desperate skill that would harm himself. As his own cultivation
                                            level grew, Zhou Weiqing began to understand the price his father would have
                                            to pay to use such a Sealing Skill. Perhaps, in the future, Zhou Weiqing
                                            might be able to remove the Seal, but as the user of the Darkness
                                            Consolidated Fate Denying Seal… even Long Shiya did not have the confidence
                                            to keep Admiral Zhou alive.</p>
                                        <p>This was also an important reason why Zhou Weiqing wanted to keep close ties
                                            with the Heavenly Demon Sect. All other reasons aside, he knew that the core
                                            of the Heavenly Demon Sect had the Life Attribute. Tian’er’s Divine
                                            Attribute and Long Shiya’s power could perhaps have a chance to keep his
                                            father alive, but if he truly wanted to help him recover, he would
                                            definitely need the support and aid of the Life Attribute. Even if it were
                                            just this reason alone, Zhou Weiqing would definitely keep good terms with
                                            the Heavenly Demon Sect. Of course, for negotiation’s sake, he would not
                                            reveal this fact to them too early.</p>
                                        <p>After all, Zhou Weiqing had never been an ambitious person. One could even
                                            say that his character was rather lazy. For him to have his current
                                            achievements, a lot of it was forced out of him through all sorts of
                                            different pressures and strresses. Especially the fall of the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire and his parents and godfather’s loss, that was a massive influence on
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi’s working efficiency was high, and since Zhou Weiqing had allowed him
                                            to use more ‘persuasive’ forceful means, he had sent all five hundred of his
                                            Peerless Regiment First Main Company out to do as ordered. In just a short
                                            period of time, they had succeeded beyond even his requirements. Just a
                                            short while after Zhou Weiqing and the others had ascended the city walls,
                                            at least three to four hundred citizens had been grabbed up onto the wall as
                                            well.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, mission accomplished.” Lei Zi grinned as he sidled closer to Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at him and said: “This is far more than two hundred eh?
                                            Well, get all the brothers up on the walls. I want each one to personally be
                                            in charge of a single citizen. Ensure that they open their eyes wide and
                                            watch everything that happens outside the city walls. Tell them who our
                                            Peerless Regiment fellows are. At the same time, be prepared to receive Ma
                                            Qun and the others when they return.”</p>
                                        <p>Lei Zi said in a slightly upset tone: “Boss, why don’t you let us go! It’s
                                            just a mere Regiment, it wouldn’t be a problem for us five hundred as well!
                                            Just kiting them alone, we are confident of killing them all.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “The art of kiting takes a lot of skill, but for ordinary
                                            citizens, the visual impact and shock of it will not be as impressive.
                                            Furthermore, if anything amiss occurs, do you think the Heavy Cavalry and
                                            their speed will able to support you in time? On the contrary, you all will
                                            be able to support them if anything comes up. Alright, enough. Follow your
                                            orders.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes sir.”</p>
                                        <p>Yan Zhexi had followed Zhou Weiqing all the way and was standing by his side.
                                            Looking at the enemies in the distance, he muttered: “Commander, if we truly
                                            have sufficient power to take these enemies on directly, it is a good way to
                                            prevent them from surrounding us and causing us trouble by splitting our
                                            forces.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Indeed, that is also my goal. Well,
                                            once our main forces arrive, we will also be relieved of such an awkward
                                            position. Oh by the way, how goes the recruitment of temporary army cooks
                                            and other logistical positions?”</p>
                                        <p>Yan Zhexi said: “Basically we have gathered enough army cooks. The Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire does indeed hold the hearts of the populace. Although many still
                                            maintain a suspicious attitude, but there are those who already accept us
                                            and are willing to give us help in our fight against the Kalise Empire. In
                                            fact, there are already some who wish to join up in the army, which is the
                                            reason why I was asking about actual recruitment.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Good, but there is no rush for recruitment
                                            yet. Let’s wait until everything is stabilized before we discuss it. I want
                                            every single citizen of the Crescent City to know that not only is the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire back, we also have a powerful army that can crush the
                                            Kalise Empire. When they have true confidence in us, full acceptance of us,
                                            that will be a cohesive unity that will reforge the entire Crescent City. In
                                            truth, our return is already a lot earlier than all my previous
                                            expectations, so I am not too worried or urgent. Taking things a step at a
                                            time is the best method currently.</p>
                                        <p>Before long, all the preparations had been made. The five hundred archers of
                                            the Peerless Regiment First Main Company stood in a row along the wall. The
                                            citizens which had been brought up stood along with them, not knowing why
                                            they were here. All of them stood there with mixed emotions, many trembling
                                            in fear as they looked at the warriors in gleaming mail armour beside
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>“Send orders to Ma Qun and Crow, set up formation outside the city!”</p>
                                        <p>The city gates opened, and the two hundred Heavy Cavalry soldiers rode out.
                                            For a small city like the Crescent City, there was no moat, and naturally
                                            there was no need for any drawbridge. The citizens on top of the wall saw
                                            the massive bodies appearing outside the city, and they couldn’t help but
                                            stare dazedly. In the distance, the Kalise Empire soldiers also saw the
                                            movement. Those warriors in heavy armor was just too huge and robust
                                            looking, and standing together they seemed like a wall of metal… and their
                                            warhorses… why did they have wings!? Those mounts were so huge, and they
                                            also had their own armour… Were they Heavy Cavalry? But… that didn’t seem
                                            exactly right…?</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing’s voice rang out across the entire city
                                            wall, loud and clear.</p>
