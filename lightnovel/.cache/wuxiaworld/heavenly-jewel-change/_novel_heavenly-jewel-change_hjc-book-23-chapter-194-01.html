                                            Master was Long Shiya... it was sufficient for both the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain to want to draw him to their side. As
                                            such, it had ended up in such a strange delicate but amazing situation.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu sighed and nodded towards Zhou Weiqing, saying: “Alright, you have
                                            won. I can represent the Heavenly Demon Sect to make a direct guarantee to
                                            you. During your efforts to revive your homeland, we will definitely not
                                            provide any aid to the Bai Da Empire or Kalise Empire. We hope to gain your
                                            friendship. However… we would like to know what is your final goal… is it
                                            just to revive your Heavenly Bow Empire, or do you have greater
                                            ambitions?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Regarding that, I can’t say for sure
                                            as I shall not have the final say. That will have to wait until our Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire’s Emperor to make the final decision. Of course, all of that will
                                            have to wait until we succeed in reviving our homeland.”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu couldn’t help but scold him inwardly. This little rascal was truly
                                            ‘waterproof’ indeed! Looks like I must give him some strong medicine
                                            first.</p>
                                        <p>“Commander Zhou, let us end our official business here then. I have some
                                            other personal matters, can we discuss them now?” Ming Yu’s expression
                                            resumed to his normal, calm and unflurried state.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily. “What personal matters?” All of a sudden,
                                            he had a strange ominous feeling, as he saw a thread of delight in Ming Yu’s
                                            eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu laughed heartily and said: “Nothing much, just that Commander Zhou
                                            shouldn’t have forgotten about what you have done previously right? Although
                                            I do not know what Godly Technique Commander Zhou was cultivating at that
                                            time, but our dear Princess had aided you in a heavy price. Wouldn’t
                                            Commander Zhou make some time to visit our little Princess? After all, after
                                            she returned, she has been thinking about you day and night!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s body froze instantly. At the same time, he abruptly sensed an
                                            aura of ill intent from both sides around him.</p>
                                        <p>“My Dear God General, you are truly savage! Let us return to official
                                            business. If I am willing to let you command my Peerless Regiment, would you
                                            be willing to leave the Fei Li Empire to join our Heavenly Bow Empire?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing instantly changed the topic, and he quickly brought up a topic
                                            that he knew Ming Yu was most interested in. He knew that would definitely
                                            cause Ming Yu to change his focus instantly.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu stared at Zhou Weiqing in surprise. “You are willing to let me be in
                                            charge of your Peerless Regiment?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Not be in charge of, but be in
                                            command to direct it. I believe that if the Fei Li God General becomes our
                                            Heavenly Bow God General, the Peerless Regiment would be able to better
                                            flourish their combat prowess… to become even more terrifying.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing those words, Ming Yu’s breathing grew rapid and urgent. As a military
                                            commander, who would not dream of commanding such a gloriously powerful
                                            troop? He had witnessed the terrifying power of the Peerless Regiment with
                                            his own eyes, and his own body. If he were to become their Commander, he
                                            truly believed that they could be forged into an invincible force.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued: “Furthermore, I am even more interested to know… If I
                                            wish to earn the support of the Heavenly Demon Sect, what price do I need to
                                            pay?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu took a deep breath and said: “Very simple. We have two requests
                                            before we can place ourselves fully in your camp. Firstly, the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire needs to actually acknowledge our Heavenly Demon Sect publicly. That
                                            is to say, once the Heavenly Bow Empire has been restored, you will not
                                            resume following the world in declaring us an Evil or Heretical Sect.
                                            Instead, you must recognize us as a legit party and our status in the
                                            Mainland. This is our first, and most important request.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and nodded: “I am already considered friends with the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect. Originally, I have even perused through your Demonic
                                            Manual. This first request, I can personally agree to it. In the first
                                            place, I also have the Demonic Attribute and the Demonic Change State, how
                                            can I not recognize the Heavenly Demon Sect?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu nodded, both delighted and gratified. “Since Commander Zhou has
                                            already said that, our chances of working together are definitely very high.
                                            Well, as for the second request, we hope that after the Heavenly Bow Empire
                                            has been revived, it can become the asylum or shelter for our Heavenly Demon
                                            Sect… allowing us to go through a full migration to your Empire.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing those words, Zhou Weiqing started momentarily. “You all want to
                                            become the background supreme ruler of our Heavenly Bow Empire?” How could
                                            he not understand what the Heavenly Demon Sect was implying? Without
                                            question, they were looking at the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and its relation
                                            with the ZhongTian Empire, or the Heavenly Snow Mountain and its status in
                                            the WanShou Empire.</p>
                                        <p>The greatest weakness of the Heavenly Demon Sect was that they had no place
                                            to set roots, with no Empire which would support them and allow them to
                                            grow. This greatly restricted their basic safety and also their growth
                                            potential. However, in the current state of things, it was impossible for
                                            them to choose and large empires to forge such a relationship, and targeting
                                            a small Empire was actually a realistic goal.</p>
                                        <p>It was clear that the previous goal of the Heavenly Demon Sect was the Kalise
                                            Empire, but the Kalise Empire was far too deep in control under the Bai Da
                                            Empire. As such, the Heavenly Demon Sect had not succeeded after several
                                            tries, leaving them still in the Bai Da Empire with an awkward status. After
                                            all, although the Heavenly Demon Sect was considered one of the Great Saint
                                            Lands, their overall power was far from comparable to the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace or the Heavenly Snow Mountain. It was impossible for them to directly
                                            clash with a large Empire.</p>
                                        <p>A faint light flashed in the room, and Zhou Weiqing’s face turned icy cold.
                                            His hands were held before his chest, his eyes narrowed and clearly filled
                                            with anger and ill intent.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu smiled bitterly and said: “What background supreme leader? All our
                                            Heavenly Sect needs is a place to stay and place down roots. As you know, it
                                            is extremely difficult for us to even survive in the entire mainland. We do
                                            not have any intentions of controlling your Heavenly Bow Empire at all.
                                            Furthermore, even if we wanted to, your Master alone isn’t someone our
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect dares to offend.”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at how Ming Yu was placing the Heavenly Demon Sect in such a position
                                            of weakness, Zhou Weiqing smirked coldly in his heart. Indeed, they might
                                            not have intentions currently, or rather, they were not capable of doing so…
                                            but in the future? If he allowed the Heavenly Demon Sect to enter the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire and set up their headquarters, it could end up as a
                                            cancerous growth that might blow up in his face at anytime. When the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect gained second wind and recovered their true strength,
                                            who was to say what they would do in future?</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, Ming Yu sighed in his heart. <i>It looks like
                                            this negotiations will most likely be falling through. This Zhou Weiqing is
                                            just too intelligent and astute, it will be just too difficult for him to
                                            agree to such a request. </i></p>
                                        <p>However, to Ming Yu’s shock, the next moment Zhou Weiqing actually nodded
                                            towards him, even smiling as he said: “Very well, I agree to your second
                                            request as well.”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu almost thought he had heard wrongly. “What… what did you say?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded once more and said: “I said, I can agree to both terms
                                            that your Heavenly Demon Sect have come up with. Are you that
                                            surprised?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu did not even bother trying to hide his thoughts, nodding as he said:
                                            “Indeed, I am very surprised. With your intelligence and astute thoughts,
                                            how could you easily agree to such terms? This makes me somewhat
                                            ill-at-ease.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “You do not need to feel so ill at
                                            ease. I can explain my thoughts to you to assuage your curiosity. There are
                                            three reasons why I would agree in the end. Firstly, I do not have any
                                            malice or ill intentions towards the Heavenly Demon Sect, maybe because I
                                            also have the Demonic Attribute. Secondly, I do not think that the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect will be of threat to our Heavenly Bow Empire in the future, that
                                            is because as long as we can our strength sufficiently high, there is
                                            nothing to be afraid of. Thirdly, with the Heavenly Demon Sect stationed
                                            within our borders, that will also be a great aid for us in growing
                                            stronger… perhaps more so… your existence would always be a constant whip
                                            behind us, an impetus for us to keep growing and to never slacken off.”</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing was smiling as he spoke, those words and the strong
                                            confidence behind them caused Ming Yu’s heart to ripple agitatedly.</p>
                                        <p>He was actually using the Heavenly Demon Sect as his own whetstone? To grind
                                            the blade of himself and his Empire?! Indeed, what Zhou Weiqing said was
                                            true, if one’s strength was sufficient, why would he be afraid of the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect? At least, currently, with the Six Ultimate Heavenly
                                            Emperor by his side, he did not need to fear anything. Furthermore, in the
                                            future, who could say whether or not Zhou Weiqing would also become an
                                            existence like the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, or even greater?</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu stood up, actually bowing slightly towards Zhou Weiqing as he said:
                                            “I represent the several hundreds of my Heavenly Demon Sect brethren in
                                            thanking Commander Zhou’s magnanimous generosity. Currently, on the surface
                                            we still aren’t able to actively help you in terms of reviving your Empire.
                                            After all, even if we tried it would not be a good thing for you. However,
                                            regarding Commander Zhou’s first proposal, I am highly interested. However,
                                            I would need some time to prepare to do so. When you begin your
                                            counterattack into the Heavenly Bow Empire to begin the revival of your
                                            homeland, I will definitely find a way to do so. Alright, shall we end our
                                            discussion here? I shall take my leave now.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, Ming Yu once again pulled up his cowl before heading out.
                                            Zhou Weiqing walked him to the doorway, and just as Ming Yu was about to
                                            descend the stairs, he suddenly turned around and said to Zhou Weiqing:
                                            “Remember, leave that position for me. I am looking forward to it.
                                            Hahaha.”</p>
                                        <p>The Fei Li God General had left, but not long after, Zhou Weiqing’s room
                                            burst into dangerous excitement once more. Alas for Little Fatty, regarding
                                            his own connection with Little Witch, he had no choice but to come clean
                                            now.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>The next morning, when Zhou Weiqing woke up, he had obvious black eyes. (<i>Zen:
                                            I think this is referring to dark circles from lack of sleep, not getting
                                            beaten up?</i>) With a gloomy and overcast face, he gave the order to move
                                            out from the Fei Li Empire, heading towards the original Heavenly Bow Empire
                                            territory.</p>
                                        <p>At last, Zhou Weiqing led his Peerless Regiment to begin working towards the
                                            revival of his Empire.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, the entire Mainland was not quiet at all. Chaos had began
                                            to rear its ugly head.</p>
                                        <p>To the north, the WanShou Empire had just finished with its annual border
                                            wars, and there was not much action there. However, for the rest of the
                                            Mainland, sudden unrest ensued. Amongst the most obvious was the Dan Dun
                                            Empire situated far to the south. Just as Zhou Weiqing had actually reached
                                            the Fei Li Empire previously, the Dan Dun Empire had suddenly launched an
                                            attack against its neighbour, also one of the larger Empires in the
                                            Mainland, the Geritimo Empire.</p>
                                        <p>War broke out just so suddenly, so much so that by the time the ZhongTian
                                            Empire received news of it, both sides had already been embroiled in major
                                            battles. The most shocking thing for the ZhongTian Empire was that, in such
                                            a short period of time, the Geritimo Empire had already lost one third of
                                            its land!</p>
                                        <p>It had to be known that although the Dan Dun Empire had always been stronger
                                            than the Geritimo Empire, it should not be to such a standard. Yet, the
                                            Geritimo Empire just hadn’t been able to withstand the pressure.</p>
                                        <p>Instantly, the ZhongTian Empire and the Bao Po Empire sent a joint Regiment
                                            to the Dan Dun Empire to mediate and try to stop the war. By this time, the
                                            war had already gone on for more than a month, and some of the Geritimo
                                            Empire’s most fertile lands had already been conquered by the Dan Dun
                                            Empire.</p>
                                        <p>According to the ZhongTian Empire’s investigations, the cause of the war was
                                            because of some minor scuffles on the borders. Using this as an excuse for
                                            revenge, the Dan Dun Empire had launched an abrupt invasion. It was clear
                                            that this was actually a premeditated attack from the Dan Dun Empire, that
                                            had been planned for a long time. In such a short period of time, they had
                                            gathered a massive army of more than a million strong, charging directly
                                            into the Geritimo Empire to conquer some of the choicest bits.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of geography, the Dan Dun Empire was at the absolute south of the
                                            continent, while the Geritimo Empire was more of a Central South. The two
                                            Empires shared quite a border, but to their north, there was a large patch
                                            of several smaller Empires that separated them from the ZhongTian
                                            Empire!</p>
