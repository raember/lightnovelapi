                                            Stage powerhouse who had lost the ability to resist. With the Saint Energy
                                            powering the Devour Skill, it was truly just too strong. All his attempts to
                                            resist were futile.</p>
                                        <p>With Zhou Weiqing’s terrifying strength, his other arm was also instantly
                                            shattered. What followed next was the increase of the shocking suction force
                                            from Zhou Weiqing’s right palm as contact was made, not even giving him time
                                            to scream in agony.</p>
                                        <p>This was truly the first time since Zhou Weiqing had gained the actual Saint
                                            Energy that he could use the Devour Skill without holding back at all, with
                                            the aid of his Saint Energy!</p>
                                        <p>The Bai Da powerhouse in his hands was trembling violently, and a strange
                                            sight occurred. Everyone could clearly see him actually growing old right in
                                            front of them as not just his Heavenly Energy, life force and even soul was
                                            drained out of him. The speed of Devouring was just too terrifying when it
                                            was powered with the drop of Saint Energy. When the other Bai Da Empire
                                            powerhouses recovered from Tian’er’s spirit attack, the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master in Zhou Weiqing’s hand had already become a dessicated corpse, and in
                                            the next instant the corpse actually disintegrated into dust, blown away by
                                            the wind.</p>
                                        <p>This time, the Devour Skill gave Zhou Weiqing a totally different feeling. He
                                            found that when the Heavenly Energy mixed with life force and soul energy
                                            entered his body, it instantly entered the Saint Energy whirlpool
                                            automatically, and drops of Saint Energy were transformed quickly, directly
                                            entering his own personal little Saint Energy whirlpool.</p>
                                        <p>For this six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, with his Heavenly Energy expended
                                            to a certain degree, he had only given Zhou Weiqing a total of seven drops
                                            of Saint Energy. It had to be known that this was also having his entire
                                            life force and soul drained. Similarly at the six-Jeweled cultivation level,
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s own Heavenly Energy alone had been transformed into more than
                                            twenty drops of Saint Energy. This was the massive difference between those
                                            who had the Saint Attributes and those without.</p>
                                        <p>Despite the fact that the Devour Skill in its current state would only bring
                                            him Saint Energy, the addition of the seven drops of Saint Energy instantly
                                            perked Zhou Weiqing up, giving his entire mind and spirit a huge boost.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, he did not transfer any Saint Energy back to Tian’er.
                                            Currently, he needed to fight, and they could balance things out after he
                                            had dealt with all these enemies in front of him.</p>
                                        <p>He quickly infused a drop of Heavenly Energy directly into his QiHai
                                            Acupuncture Point. With the fusion of the Saint Energy, it was as if a fresh
                                            breath of life was blown into the QiHai Acupuncture Point, drawing in more
                                            Heavenly Energy from outside, with the absorption rate greatly increased,
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s ordinary Heavenly Energy also began to recover at a even more
                                            terrifying pace.</p>
                                        <p>“All of you, come meet your maker at I, Your Father’s hands!” Zhou Weiqing
                                            shoutedly loudly. However, his actions were contrary to his words, as he
                                            abruptly sprang upwards, still holding on to Tian’er tightly. His wings
                                            flapped hard, and instantly the pair of them shot up into the skies. Above
                                            his head, a purplish red light appeared at once… forming an illusory image…
                                            it was the Demonic Dragon Lady!</p>
                                        <p>Previously, during the hours of fighting, Zhou Weiqing had to take into
                                            account the entire battlefield, and he had too many enemies surrounding him.
                                            As such, he did not have any chance to use the Dragon Silencing Seal.
                                            Furthermore, in the first place he had not even prepared the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal in his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, as it took too
                                            long to prepare this powerful Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, with Tian’er’s assistance and the additional fresh new seven drops
                                            of Saint Energy, coupled with the fact that there were much fewer enemies
                                            left, he could finally fully flourish this extremely useful Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing would not infuse his Saint Energy directly into the
                                            Dragon Silencing Seal. He did not want the Demonic Dragon Lady to come to
                                            live. It wasn’t that he was too afraid of any Heavenly Emperor powerhouse
                                            questioning him, though that was also a consideration. However, the main
                                            point was that with both his own and Tian’er’s current state, if they tried
                                            to bring a Heavenly Skill Image to life like the previous time, it would be
                                            their turn to be drained to death.</p>
                                        <p>Even without the infusion of Saint Energy, the Dragon Silencing Seal was
                                            undoubtedly an extremely powerful Skill. The remaining six Bai Da Empire
                                            powerhouses could only stand there and watch Zhou Weiqing fly away. They did
                                            not have their own Consolidated Wings, and before the Heavenly King stage,
                                            how could they chase him?</p>
                                        <p>“Not good…!”</p>
                                        <p>Alas, by the time they wanted to react, it was too late. Zhou Weiqing’s eyes
                                            were filled with a strong killing intent. The Dragon Silencing Seal
                                            unleashed… with his current six-Jeweled stage, he was able to use the it six
                                            times daily, and without holding anything back, he used them all at
                                            once.</p>
                                        <p>One of the greatest benefit of the Dragon Silencing Seal was that it did not
                                            consume any of his Heavenly Energy at all. Six bouts of Dragon Silencing
                                            Seals, and the six Ba Da Empire powerhouses were instantly struck with it.
                                            Their Consolidated Equipment, Stored Skills, were all Sealed away. At this
                                            point, Zhou Weiqing had also recovered some of his Heavenly Energy with the
                                            aid of his scary regenerative rate and the Saint Energy whirlpool, and he at
                                            least had the strength to fight once more.</p>
                                        <p>His heart was currently bleeding! He had personally built the Peerless
                                            Regiment from ground up, all the way from when it was just a mere Ruffian
                                            Battalion, and he had deep feelings for these brothers of his. The Peerless
                                            Regiment was also his greatest dependence towards his dream of reviving his
                                            homeland. Now, looking at things, he did not even know how many of the
                                            Peerless Regiment soldiers still survived, how could he not be enraged?</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing had long forgotten any of those useless sayings
                                            about killing too much being against the heavens. This was war! War! If he
                                            did not destroy his enemies, then his enemies would destroy him.</p>
                                        <p>In Zhou Weiqing’s heart, there was not even the slightest bit of pity or
                                            mercy left for these enemies before him.</p>
                                        <p>The effect of the Dragon Silencing Seal gave the six Bai Da Empire
                                            powerhouses a huge shock. Facing this ‘fresh’ Zhou Weiqing who had suddenly
                                            become so powerful, they no longer felt the need to stubbornly continue
                                            fighting. However, their fighting experience was extremely abundant, and
                                            they did not panic. Instantly, the six of them flew off in different
                                            directions.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s reactions were just as quick. He immediately chose one of the
                                            eight-Jeweled Mid Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters as his prey,
                                            pouncing upon him instantly. At this point, he was no longer using the Six
                                            Ultimate Godly Light Formation, and he just swept his hand and unleashed a
                                            Fetters of Wind.</p>
                                        <p>A Blink Skill, Absolute Delay, and Touch of Darkness. Instantly, he appeared
                                            next to his restricted foe, and two more powerful Control Skills followed
                                            suit. This poor Mid Level Zong Stage powerhouse who had already expended so
                                            much energy in the past hours, and no longer had access to his Stored Skills
                                            and Consolidated Equipment… how could he possibly withstand for long,
                                            especially now that his mind was fully on retreat? Even when he tried to put
                                            up a last minute resistance, Tian’er quickly dealt with him using another
                                            Spirit Attack.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s right palm clapped savagely on his throat, and the Devour
                                            Skill activated once more. This time, due to the fact that he did not infuse
                                            his Saint Energy, the Devouring process was much slower. However, this
                                            eight-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master was still unable to escape from Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s grasp.</p>
                                        <p>Drop after drop of Saint Energy formed in Zhou Weiqing’s body. An
                                            eight-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master was just different! By the time he
                                            crumbled into dust, he had ‘gifted’ Zhou Weiqing with twenty six drops of
                                            Saint Energy!</p>
                                        <p>By now, the other five enemies had fled down the city walls and away.
                                            Naturally, Zhou Weiqing used the opportunity to share half the Saint Energy
                                            with Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>With the additional dozen or so drops of Saint Energy, both of them could
                                            clearly sense the life force in their bodies brimming and thriving, their
                                            original sense of exhaustion weakening greatly.</p>
                                        <p>However, though they had killed most of the enemy powerhouses and sent the
                                            rest fleeing, the battle was still not over.</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty, help me.” Tian’er abruptly said to Zhou Weiqing before he
                                            could decide what to do. Next, he instantly sensed a great suction force
                                            from Tian’er, directed at the Saint Energy whirlpool.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er’s entire body started glowing a brilliant gold, and she was soon
                                            covered in a layer of gold light. A thick Heavenly Energy reverberation
                                            began to emanate from her along with the rising gold light.</p>
                                        <p>Their minds were so connected that Zhou Weiqing instantly knew what she
                                            wanted to do. Besides the ten drops of Saint Energy that was required to
                                            maintain his personal little Saint Energy whirlpool, he quickly sent all of
                                            his remaining Saint Energy, including the freshly devoured ones, into
                                            Tian’er’s body through their connected hands.</p>
                                        <p>Towards any other person, he might need to use his mouth to transfer Saint
                                            Energy. However, for Tian’er, it was no longer necessary. With the support
                                            of the large Saint Energy whirlpool, it was as if their bodies were like
                                            one.</p>
                                        <p>With the over thirty drops of Saint Energy he had just Devoured, along with
                                            the remaining usable from both of them, they had more than fifty drops of
                                            Saint Energy total. As Tian’er unleashed her Skill, it was diminishing
                                            quickly.</p>
                                        <p>Above Tian’er’s head, a cloud of gold light was slowly forming. Next, a
                                            streak of gold light rose into the skies, as if the illumination of dawn.
                                            Under this streak of gold light, the cloud of gold also began to expand
                                            rapidly.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing such a strange sight, the warriors on both sides couldn’t help but
                                            lift their heads, their eyes filled with surprise as they gazed upon it.
                                            However, in a stark contrast from the terror that Zhou Weiqing’s Hell’s
                                            Angel brought, this patch of gold light only gave them a peaceful feeling, a
                                            holy, divine aura that was calming and peaceful.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Tian’er had been fully covered with this gold colour, and she
                                            looked just like a goddess descended from the heavens, causing anyone who
                                            looked at her to have the urge to kneel down and pay obeisance.</p>
                                        <p>After more than twenty drops of Saint Energy had been expended, the streak of
                                            gold light finally disappeared, and the gold cloud in the skies suddenly
                                            trembled slightly as it began to rain… golden droplets of rain.</p>
                                        <p>This gold rain did not differentiate between friend or foe, covering the
                                            entire south walls. It wasn’t just the Peerless Regiment soldiers, even the
                                            enemy soldiers were bathed in the light gold rain.</p>
                                        <p>The rain painted the entire city walls a gold hue, the brilliant light giving
                                            everyone a sense of awe and beauty.</p>
                                        <p>When a drop of rain fell upon one of the soldier’s, no matter how thick his
                                            armour was, it did not stop the rain.</p>
                                        <p>This small, thin, weak looking rain, yet what it brought to them was an
                                            endless pleasant surprise.</p>
                                        <p>No matter any kind of wound, soaked in this gentle gold rain, they just
                                            healed as such a rapid pace that could be seen with the naked eye. Not only
                                            that, everyone could clearly sense their physical strength and vigor being
                                            restored even as their wounds healed, even the Heavenly Energy in their
                                            bodies was being regenerated at a greatly boosted pace, their connection
                                            with the atmospheric energy increased.</p>
                                        <p>This Skill was called the Holy Light Skill, an area of effect type recovery
                                            and restorative Skill. The gold light in the air earlier was actually its
                                            Heavenly Skill Image. Within the area of effect of the Skill, it was able to
                                            heal any wounds, even clearing some of the negative influences that other
                                            skills or attributes might have brought, even undoing some light Seals. At
                                            the same time, it would also boost the recovery of vigor and even Heavenly
                                            Energy. This was one of the strongest support Skills in the world, in terms
                                            of healing and restoration.</p>
