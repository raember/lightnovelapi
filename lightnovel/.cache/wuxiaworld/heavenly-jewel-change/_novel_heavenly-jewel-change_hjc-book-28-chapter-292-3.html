                                            the leader of the Saint Land was usually the last to take part in the
                                            tournament to guarantee the highest chance of victory. Nobody had expected
                                            Zhou Weiqing personally take the field when the Peerless Sect was in the
                                            lead.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Tian Yu had mentioned - did the Peerless Sect truly have no one else?
                                            However, the woman, who wore a cloak over her head, that had killed off the
                                            Blood Red Hell Heavenly King earlier was clearly at least of the Heavenly
                                            Emperor Stage; she could very well even be at least on par with Wu Yunyue.
                                            Hence, why did Zhou Weiqing choose to enter the tournament, instead of
                                            sending her in?</p>
                                        <p>Everyone was thoroughly confused by Zhou Weiqing’s unconventional strategy
                                            that defied logic. </p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian said in a deep voice, “Indeed, the Grand Tournament has such a
                                            rule. However, are you sure that you want to enter the field? Once you lose,
                                            the Peerless Sect will no longer be able to take part in the later stage of
                                            the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing naturally raised his hand and put it around Shangguan Xue’er’s
                                            slender waist, “Yes, I am sure.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er moved away from Zhou Weiqing’s grip and gave him an angry
                                            stare without saying a word before walking back to the Peerless Sect.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing awkwardly put his hand down and coughed twice before saying to
                                            Tian Yu, “After you.”</p>
                                        <p>With Zhou Weiqing substituting Shangguan Xue’er, Tian Yu immediately became a
                                            lot more anxious. Regardless of how young Zhou Weiqing was, he was after all
                                            the leader of a Saint Land. Furthermore, from his earlier exchange with Fen
                                            Tian, he could tell that Zhou Weiqing was definitely not weak. Under such
                                            circumstance, Tian Yu was not confident of winning. Fen Tian was definitely
                                            not entering the tournament at this stage. Witnessing Zhou Weiqing’s strange
                                            battle strategy, Fen Tian was slightly shocked for a brief moment before
                                            going back to his normal state. </p>
                                        <p>Be it in the eyes of Fen Tian or other people, a good majority of the
                                            powerhouses had the same sentiment - the Peerless Sect was lacking in
                                            strength.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Sect seemed to have the greatest advantage in the early stage of
                                            the tournament and that they were also the Saint Land with the best results
                                            as of now. However in truth, Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue did not defeat that
                                            many opponents, particularly the Heavenly God Long Shiya, who had only faced
                                            Shen Mo before getting disqualified from that round. He did not manage to
                                            make much of an impact on the whole. Amongst the rest of the members of the
                                            Peerless Sect, there were no other established powerhouses. Perhaps Zhou
                                            Weiqing was truly powerful, but could he be stronger than his own master?
                                            Furthermore, he had stepped into the arena that early in the tournament,
                                            which would give the rest of the Saint Lands more opportunities to test the
                                            waters. Entering the fourth cycle by himself, even if he was that powerful,
                                            how many more cycles could he endure? </p>
                                        <p>Tian Yu’s figure flashed and soared up tens of meters into the sky, releasing
                                            black light on his back that transformed into two enormous black wings made
                                            up of Destruction Energy that spread wide open in the sky. This pair of
                                            black wings could be seen so clearly, including the details of every single
                                            feather. However, it was completely condensed from a high concentration of
                                            Destruction Energy. As the wings flapped hard, Tian Yu’s body rocketed into
                                            the sky, reaching a height of over a thousand meters in the blink of an
                                            eye.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s movements were clearly a lot slower than that of Tian Yu’s.
                                            Even so, by taking a single leap, he had immediately disappeared into the
                                            sky.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing that, every single person’s pupils could not help but contract. Even
                                            though it was not Zhou Weiqing’s first time using Spatial Law to execute the
                                            Blink Skill, it still astounded everyone. </p>
                                        <p>Tian Yu’s will was continuously locked onto Zhou Weiqing’s body. When Zhou
                                            Weiqing had suddenly vanished, he had immediately reacted. The wings behind
                                            his back wrapped around him one by one, and at the same time, his body
                                            started spiraling in the sky. He used the enormous black wings of energy to
                                            protect his entire body. The unrestrained Destruction Energy erupted in the
                                            sky, engulfing at least a hundred square meters of space in the
                                            surroundings. Even though the area was not that big, it was filled with an
                                            intense Destruction Storm. Tian Yu had reached a conclusion that even if
                                            Zhou Weiqing was powerful, he would definitely not dare to appear within his
                                            Destruction Storm. Otherwise, he would definitely have full confidence in
                                            killing Zhou Weiqing. Hence, after releasing the Destruction Storm, he had
                                            swiftly equipped himself with a Legendary Set.</p>
                                        <p>However, most of the time, several things would not go according to one’s
                                            plan. More often than not, when the most highly improbable situation
                                            occurred, it would bring about the greatest impact. </p>
                                        <p>The moment the Destruction Storm was formed, Zhou Weiqing had instantly
                                            appeared. Furthermore, not only did he appear within the Destruction Storm,
                                            he had appeared right in front of Tian Yu, where the Destruction Storm was
                                            the most concentrated and powerful. </p>
                                        <p>In the instant when Zhou Weiqing appeared, his entire body released a layer
                                            of golden starlight that was approximately a foot thick. A violent collision
                                            erupted between the Destruction Storm and the golden starlight. However,
                                            this did not affect Zhou Weiqing’s movements.</p>
                                        <p>He aimed his fist at his chest; an extremely simple punch flew right towards
                                            Tian Yu.</p>
                                        <p>According to Tian Yu’s initial judgment, even though Zhou Weiqing had grasped
                                            the Spatial Law, he would have to appear outside of the Destruction Storm,
                                            before he would think of a way to attack him, taking a risk-averse approach.
                                            However, Zhou Weiqing’s appearance was too strange - he had appeared
                                            directly in front of him. The Destruction Storm that he took pride in had
                                            absolutely no effect on Zhou Weiqing. This was what scared Tian Yu the
                                            most. </p>
                                        <p>As everything was too sudden, all Tian Yu could do was to defend himself. At
                                            this moment, he was not done equipping himself with the Legendary Set and
                                            the weapons had yet to appear.</p>
                                        <p>Sensing that his life was in danger, Tian Yu made a prompt decision and went
                                            with what he thought was his best option. As a Heavenly Emperor, he had
                                            experienced hundreds of battles. He had immediately figured out that Zhou
                                            Weiqing must have relied on some ability in order to appear within his
                                            Destruction Storm. Hence, instead of resisting Zhou Weiqing’s fist, he
                                            struck Zhou Weiqing’s neck with both his hands.</p>
                                        <p>Attacking the enemy to save oneself - it was a move that resulted in losses
                                            on both sides. At this moment, at least Tian Yu’s armor was almost fully
                                            equipped on his body, whereas Zhou Weiqing had not equipped himself with any
                                            Consolidated Equipment Set. Tian Yu had assumed that he definitely had the
                                            upper hand.</p>
                                        <p>However, in the next moment, shock had filled Tian Yu’s eyes. That was
                                            because Zhou Weiqing did not dodge his attack.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, Zhou Weiqing did not dodge or resist his attack. His fist continued
                                            to approach Tian Yu. </p>
                                        <p>Bam ——</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s fist had landed on Tian Yu’s chest first, while Tian Yu’s
                                            hands landed on each side of Zhou Weiqing’s neck in the next moment. </p>
                                        <p>Every single person down below was stunned. The two people in the sky did not
                                            seem like they were taking part in the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands -
                                            they practically looked like two children fighting with each other.</p>
                                        <p>However, what happened next caused them to be dumbstruck. </p>
                                        <p>Bang ——</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s fist pounded against Tian Yu’s chest, but the latter did not
                                            fly upon impact. Instead, his fist was adhered to his body. The Legendary
                                            Set that Tian Yu just equipped himself with shattered to pieces immediately,
                                            letting out a violent ‘boom’ sound. Even the black wings on his back had
                                            vanished. On the other hand, when his hands struck Zhou Weiqing’s neck,
                                            there were only two soft thuds. Nothing else happened. </p>
                                        <p>A splat sound was heard and a sharp claw broke out of Tian Yu’s back as blood
                                            spurted out. The sharp claw hid itself and Tian Yu’s body fell to the
                                            ground.</p>
                                        <p>The sharp claw was Zhou Weiqing’s right hand. Nobody knew exactly when his
                                            hand had transformed into a sharp claw. He clenched his claw and a ball of
                                            light could be seen flashing within it, albeit faintly.</p>
                                        <p>Heavenly Core Nucleus - it was clearly Tian Yu’s Heavenly Core Nucleus. Zhou
                                            Weiqing had actually directly broken through his chest and dug out his
                                            Heavenly Core Nucleus. Even if the fatal blow that he suffered did not end
                                            his life, he was rendered useless after Zhou Weiqing had taken his Heavenly
                                            Core Nucleus.</p>
                                        <p>Tian Yu’s body had landed directly in front of Fen Tian. Fen Tian’s face
                                            immediately reddened with anger, as his body trembled. People who knew Fen
                                            Tian well knew that it was his way of showing rage. </p>
                                        <p>Apart from the battles where one of the parties had chosen to forfeit, this
                                            battle had ended the quickest. From the time when Tian Yu soared to the sky
                                            to Zhou Weiqing’s fatal attack, only three seconds had passed. The fate of a
                                            Heavenly Emperor was decided during that three seconds itself. Even his
                                            Heavenly Core Nucleus was taken away.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing, who was in mid-air, moved his neck from side to side, keeping a
                                            smile on his face. Clearly, he was fine. However, he had a sinister look on
                                            his face. </p>
                                        <p>What kind of defensive power could achieve that? Even though Tian Yu had no
                                            weapon then, he was still a full-fledged Heavenly Emperor! Attacking the
                                            enemy to save oneself - naturally, it was a full-force attack on his part.
                                            Furthermore, the neck was a lot more vulnerable compared to the chest - it
                                            was not protected by any bones. Even so, Zhou Weiqing was fine. He was being
                                            attacked with full force by a Heavenly Emperor without the protection of any
                                            Legendary Set, yet he was not injured. His body was too powerful to the
                                            point it was abnormal.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, what the shocked people did not know was that apart from Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s overbearing self-defense abilities, the neutralizing effect that
                                            the Saint Energy had on the Destruction Attribute was more vital.</p>
                                        <p>Destruction Attribute coming into contact with Saint Energy was akin to snow
                                            coming into contact with fire. The Saint Energy’s creative powers were the
                                            complete opposite of the Destruction Attribute’s destructive powers.
                                            Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy was a lot purer and denser than
                                            Tian Yu’s Destruction Energy. Under such circumstance, under the protection
                                            of his Saint Energy, coupled with his Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation,
                                            nobody present could match up to his terrifying defense power. </p>
                                        <p>One must not assume that Zhou Weiqing did not do anything. When he was
                                            engaging in Spatial Law, he had already started activating the Dragon-Tiger
                                            Demon God Transformation.</p>
                                        <p>Upon the completion of the Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation, it was a
                                            lot more discreet than before. There was no way of telling solely based on
                                            appearance - only the sinister vibe he gave off was more apparent. He also
                                            did not reveal his wings, hence, it seemed as though he resisted the
                                            Heavenly Emperor’s attack with his actual flesh and body.</p>
