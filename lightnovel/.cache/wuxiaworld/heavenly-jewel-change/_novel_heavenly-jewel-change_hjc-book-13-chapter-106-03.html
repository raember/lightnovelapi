                                            free life of his dreams. He would never hope that he would be restricted or
                                            tied to a single place.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, if he agreed on Shangguan Tianyang’s suggestion, he would
                                            lose that freedom, with the seal of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace placed on
                                            him deeply. From there on, he would always be influenced and controlled by
                                            the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, no longer belonging to himself or even his own
                                            homeland.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing thought about this point, he immediately calmed down. Of
                                            course, that was not to say that he could never pay the price of freedom,
                                            but it was a matter of whether or not it was worth it.</p>
                                        <p>On deeper thought and self reflection, the answer was no. That was because,
                                            what the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was offering, Zhou Weiqing was confident
                                            that with his own hard work and efforts, he would eventually be able to
                                            accomplish it by himself. In that case, why should he give up his own
                                            freedom for a shortcut that would only save him some time? As he slowly
                                            calmed down, he began to ask himself the second ‘why’. Why would Shangguan
                                            Tianyang give such an attractive offer? To complete an entire Legendary Set,
                                            the cost of that was so exorbitant that even the wealthy Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace could not easily ignore it.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, even if they knew his Skill Storing method, they would not be
                                            able to duplicate it. First of all, they did not have the strange tiger
                                            bloodline that they did, and they also did not have help from Fat Cat. If he
                                            told them about his method of Elemental Jewel Skill Storing, that would
                                            undoubtedly be betraying Fat Cat, and that was something Zhou Weiqing would
                                            not do. Earlier, when he had left the inn, it was because of the fact he was
                                            afraid things might be difficult for Fat Cat that he left her in the
                                            inn.</p>
                                        <p>So, why would the Heaven’s Expanse Palace give him such favourable terms?
                                            When Zhou Weiqing calmed down and thought further, he quickly understood the
                                            reasons.</p>
                                        <p>If Zhou Weiqing really accepted Shangguan Tianyang’s terms, only then would
                                            the Heaven’s Expanse Palace know about his Skill Storing methods. That meant
                                            that at least currently they did not know that this method could not be
                                            duplicated by them. As such, it also meant that in their eyes, it would
                                            definitely be worth that price. After all, a method that allowed one to
                                            Skill Store from Heavenly Beasts of much greater power levels, that was a
                                            priceless treasure that could be passed down as a legacy to generations down
                                            the road, and was of almost unthinkable value to the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace. In comparison, a mere Legendary Set was of nothing if one were to
                                            put it in perspective of a Great Saint Lands. Of course, that was all on the
                                            premise that they could make use of the method.</p>
                                        <p>Secondly, if the Heaven’s Expanse Palace helped Zhou Weiqing create his
                                            entire Legendary Set, that would mean that he would have to give them the
                                            entire Legendary Set design. That would also mean the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace would gain a new full Legendary Set design. This might not seem to be
                                            as valuable as an actual Legendary Set Equipments, but in truth, that was
                                            only for an individual person. In the point of view of a Great Saint Lands,
                                            the two were definitely of almost equal worth. After all, with the design,
                                            they would be able to continually create more of these for their own
                                            use.</p>
                                        <p>Thirdly, by making the entire Legendary Set for Zhou Weiqing, it would bind
                                            him to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace tightly. After all, not only was the
                                            Legendary Set difficult to make, he would also need to continually grow in
                                            cultivation level before he could use the next ones. In such a way, there
                                            would be yet another invisible thread binding Zhou Weiqing to them, leaving
                                            his heart and soul with the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. In addition to his
                                            connection with Shangguan Bing’er, after some time, it would not be
                                            difficult to slowly absorb Zhou Weiqing into the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. In
                                            the end, wouldn’t that mean that this Legendary Set would end up working for
                                            the Heaven’s Expanse Palace?</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that on the surface, it would seem like the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace was offering a lot, but in truth, what they gained was so much more.
                                            Other material gains aside, they would be gaining an outstanding talent,
                                            allowing them to groom him further as well.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing thought through all of that, he couldn’t help but feel an
                                            even greater sense of gratitude towards Mu En. There was always two sides to
                                            a coin, and one often had to examine something thoroughly to find out all
                                            sides. Behind a massive benefit, there was usually either a corresponding
                                            trap, danger or poison. Zhou Weiqing felt his hands twitch slightly… in that
                                            moment he truly understood why his father had sent him to this old fellow
                                            nicknamed the God Eye Scoundrel, and why as he did so, he had told him that
                                            learning from Mu En would allow him to better survive in this world, even
                                            without any powers.</p>
                                        <p>“Why are you still hesitating?” Shangguan Tianyue asked Zhou Weiqing
                                            impatiently.</p>
                                        <p>A small smile tugged at the corners of Zhou Weiqing’s lips, and he said:
                                            “Thank you Senior Shangguan for that great offer, this junior is truly
                                            honoured. However, I am also a Consolidating Equipment Master, and I hope
                                            that one day I can become a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master as well,
                                            to wear the Equipment that I have personally created. I am afraid I have to
                                            refuse this tempting offer.”</p>
                                        <p>“You are actually refusing the offer?!” Shangguan Tianyue stared at Zhou
                                            Weiqing in shock, as if looking at an idiot.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin also had a surprised look on his face, the expression in
                                            his eyes changed as he looked at Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang started momentarily, then he smiled gently and lifted his
                                            hands in a soft clapping. “Good… good… good.”</p>
                                        <p>Three 'good's. But it caused Zhou Weiqing’s heart to skip three beats
                                            alongside. He could not tell what Shangguan Tianyang was thinking about at
                                            all.</p>
                                        <p>Nodding towards Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Tianyang said: “I believe that in
                                            this world, there isn’t another person who will reject the offer I just
                                            made. Weiqing, I must admit that I have underestimated you. From now on, I
                                            will treat you like someone of my own level. Of course, that is because of
                                            your possibility and future. In that case, our previous trade will still go
                                            through as promised, and the custom God Tier Consolidated Equipment designed
                                            for your Fei Li Battle Team Leader, I shall also agree to that.”</p>
                                        <p>“Thank you Senior.” Zhou Weiqing bowed deeply once more. As the saying goes,
                                            it is never wrong to be polite, especially since with the connection of
                                            Bing’er, these few men in front of him were considered his elders and
                                            relatives as well. Not wanting to be tied fully by a trade was one thing,
                                            but he still had to give them the respect they deserved.</p>
                                        <p>“There is no need for thanks, it is what you have earned. Longyin, the rest I
                                            leave it to you. You can bring Weiqing to go about the trade we have agreed
                                            upon.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes, Palace Master.” Shangguan Longyin turned and bowed deeply towards
                                            Shangguan Tianyang. In the next instant, he flash stepped in front of Zhou
                                            Weiqing, and the two disappeared swiftly in a bright flash of gold
                                            light.</p>
                                        <p>After the two had vanished, Shangguan Tianyang looked towards Shangguan
                                            Tianyue and said smilingly: “Second Brother, what do you think?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue’s angry expression disappeared, and he smiled: “That
                                            child’s character… it looks like Bing’er has made a good choice.”</p>
                                        <p>The smile on Shangguan Tianyang’s face grew a little strange, and he sighed
                                            softly as he said: “I’m just afraid that this child will be the same as you
                                            when you were young.”</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, Shangguan Tianyue knew what his own big brother was talking about,
                                            and couldn’t help but flush slightly in embarrassment, as he said: “Big
                                            Brother, don’t mention about such things so far back in the past. Who hasn’t
                                            been young and stupid before? That little rascal Zhou Weiqing… in this
                                            aspect alone… hmph, he is even stronger than I am. Besides Bing’er, he has
                                            still some relations with that Little Witch. I even heard that this little
                                            brat actually accidentally kissed Fei’er.”</p>
                                        <p>Originally, when Zhou Weiqing accidentally kissed Shangguan Xue’er, no one
                                            else was around. With her nature, naturally she would not go around
                                            spreading it about, and only Shangguan Fei’er had managed to find out, and
                                            even so that had been deviously. As such, these two elders here did not know
                                            about that matter.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang said with a faint smile: “You shouldn’t keep scaring that
                                            poor little fellow. After all, no matter what, you are his future
                                            father-in-law. In truth, to us, everything else are just minor details… as
                                            long as both sides are willing, us old fellows shouldn’t interfere too much
                                            the younger generation. This Zhou Weiqing might be a little cunning and
                                            wily, but there is a side of him buried deep in his bones that I truly like.
                                            To be honest, before today, I would never imagine that anyone could possibly
                                            reject the offer I made just now, let alone someone of his age. Although I
                                            am a little disappointed that we aren’t able to fully bind him to us in that
                                            way, I can’t help but feel overjoyed with him. After all, no matter what, he
                                            is your son-in-law.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue gave a rather discontented humph. “What son-in-law? Wait
                                            for him to defeat Xue’er first!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang said: “You ahh… you are just too stubborn. You have
                                            clearly approved of him, yet you must always act like that. However, that
                                            child has truly shown too much of himself in this Heavenly Jewel Tournament,
                                            and that may not be a good thing. Luckily, he is not as flighty and
                                            impulsive as most other youths of his age. Well, at least with the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect and Heavenly Snow Mountain people around him, we should not need
                                            to worry too much about his safety.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue said: “Enough about that little brat. I do not know why, he
                                            can really rile me up so easily. Perhaps it is the feeling that every father
                                            has for the fellow who steals his daughter away. Anyway, Brother, I will be
                                            heading to the Heavenly Bow Empire to bring Xian’er [1. He is referring to
                                            Tang Xian, his wife] back. With Bing’er here, and now that I finally have
                                            her actual location, no matter what, this time I will definitely bring her
                                            back.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang nodded, saying: “Xian’er has suffered a lot for you. You
                                            should hurry and bring her back.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue said: “What about the border? Should we send some men to
                                            help? Recently, the WanShou Empire have been attacking viciously.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing him mention the WanShou Empire, Shangguan Tianyang furrowed his brow,
                                            saying: “No, we’ll have to hold on that temporarily. Once we actually send
                                            people to join in the fight, it will be finally truly tearing open the
                                            relations with the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Although in terms of overall
                                            combat, we might be slightly ahead, fighting in the north is just too
                                            unfavourable for us. Furthermore, if the two of our Great Saint Lands fight,
                                            it might cause a mass world war in the entire mainland, dragging all of the
                                            Great Saint Lands into war as well.”</p>
                                        <p>A cold light flashed in Shangguan Tianyue’s eyes and he said coldly: “So what
                                            if we are dragged into war? With the power of our Heaven’s Expanse Palace…
                                            and with the support of the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell, I do not
                                            believe we cannot suppress the Heavenly Snow Mountain.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang gave a bitter smile and said: “If it were as easy as you
                                            say, I would not need to be so troubled all the time. You should know as
                                            well that the WanShou Empire occupies the entire north, but that place is a
                                            bitter cold, sparse land. In such a place, ordinary humans cannot survive in
                                            such a place. Furthermore, such conditions are very beneficial for the
                                            WanShou Empire and Heavenly Snow Mountain powerhouses to fight. Even if all
                                            three of our Great Saint Land powerhouses invade them, we will not be a
                                            match in their territory. Even if we are actually able to temporarily defeat
                                            the Heavenly Snow Mountain powerhouses, all they need to do is to retreat
                                            deeper into their lands, and what can we do? Our ordinary armies are not
                                            able to join in the invasion due to the conditions, and our personal
                                            strength is limited after all. Even a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse, when
                                            facing an army of millions, will eventually fall, no matter how many he
                                            might take with him. Furthermore, in terms of ordinary soldiers, the power
                                            of the WanShou Empire is unmatchable and add on to the fact that they have
                                            no northern border to worry about… if not for the threat of our three Great
                                            Saint Lands, they would have invaded and crushed the rest of the Boundless
                                            Mainland long ago. Alas, we can still be a deterrence in terms of defense,
                                            but we do not have the capabilities of offense. After all, do not forget
                                            that all these years, the Beastmaster Armies of the Heavenly Snow Mountain
                                            has obeyed our treaty and not fought in the wars since.”</p>
