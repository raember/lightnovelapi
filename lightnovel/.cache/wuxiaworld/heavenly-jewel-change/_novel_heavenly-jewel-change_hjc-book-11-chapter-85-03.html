                                            display of agile talent, with nary a sign of attacking.</p>
                                        <p>Han Bing was indeed unbelievable in his own right as well, actually managing
                                            to merge all five waves of the ice cones. Currently, the ice cones in the
                                            sky were actually almost a chi long each! The entire air of the stage was
                                            getting colder and colder, and even the temperature of the Rest Houses were
                                            being affected at such a distance.</p>
                                        <p>With all the ice cones merged together, even if two or three of them struck
                                            Little Four, he would not be able to take it, let alone if all hit him. This
                                            low rated talent was originally rather scary in Han Bing’s hands, but after
                                            all the merging, its power alone was already at terrifying levels.</p>
                                        <p>In the Dan Dun Battle Team Rest House, Lan Feng was watching the fight and he
                                            said admiringly: “Priest is indeed Priest, such control and power… he is
                                            just too strong. Look at the state of that Fei Li Battle Team fellow… and
                                            Priest’s full power hasn’t even been unleashed yet. Not to mention the fact
                                            he is only four Jeweled, even if he were six Jeweled like Priest, he would
                                            still stand no chance.”</p>
                                        <p>The young lady leader of the Dan Dun Battle Team, or as Shangguan Longyin
                                            called her Shen Little Demon, said passively: “Do not underestimate that Fei
                                            Li Battle Team fellow. His speed, agility and ability to dodge attacks is
                                            truly impressive, especially that movement style of his - it is really quite
                                            impressive. I dare say that any other Four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master
                                            would have lost to Han Bing by now, but he is still able to hold on by a
                                            thread. However, he will not be able to hold on for that much longer. When
                                            Teacher gave Han Bing this training style to suit his special qualities, to
                                            continuously improve his spirit and control, it truly has benefited him a
                                            lot. Up til now, Han Bing has only Stored this single Skill, the Cone of
                                            Cold, but he has been able to make use of just this alone and use it in so
                                            many ways, almost infinite varieties and styles. Even I will be hard pressed
                                            to defeat him.”</p>
                                        <p>Currently, all the members of the Dan Dun Battle Team, including Shen Little
                                            Demon, were relaxed as they watched the fight, as they did not think there
                                            was any possibility of Han Bing losing. Although Little Four was still
                                            keeping up, he did not have any chance of winning; the difference between
                                            power levels of both sides was just too great.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Fei Li Battle Team, in comparison, Zhou Weiqing was also heaving a
                                            sigh of relief. He knew that although Little Four would lose in the end, he
                                            had accomplished the task set upon him nearly perfectly. At the same time,
                                            he was also thinking about how lucky he had been, to actually have been able
                                            to defeat Little Four in their bet.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, when they had bet, Little Four had only lost to Zhou Weiqing
                                            because he had severely underestimated him and his Control Skills. After
                                            all, Zhou Weiqing had just too many Control Skills, and once he had managed
                                            to get in the first strike, he had controlled Little Four all the way. At
                                            this point, seeing Little Four displaying his true speed and movements, only
                                            then did Zhou Weiqing realise how impressive he was; perhaps even at a
                                            higher level than Ultimate Agility Heavenly Jewel Masters of the same
                                            cultivation level.</p>
                                        <p>Although Han Bing was only releasing Cone of Cold and the protective blue
                                            shield, which did not have a massive drain on Heavenly Energy, but with the
                                            amount of control he was exerting, it still took a toll on his spirit. More
                                            importantly, his ice cones were all merged together, and the more that were
                                            merged together, the greater the toll on his Energy and spirit, as it became
                                            tougher and tougher to control. There was definitely a limit on that.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, as the ice cones grew larger, their piercing power and
                                            strength grew exponentially, but their speed also grew slightly slower.
                                            Furthermore, Little Four still had some skills up his sleeves.</p>
                                        <p>Yet another round of ice cones launched into the air from Han Bing. This
                                            time, when they struck the thirty six ice cones in the air and merged
                                            together, they did not continue chasing Little Four, instead separating into
                                            the air in all directions of the stage.</p>
                                        <p>*Poof* *Poof* *Poof* *Poof* *Poof* Multiple sounds rang out, as the massive
                                            two chi long ice cones stabbed down onto the stage floor, covering the
                                            entire outer ring of the stage. Impressively, the distance between each and
                                            every cone was almost exactly the same, forming thirty six large ice pillars
                                            on the outskirts, surrounding the entire stage.</p>
                                        <p>A sinking feeling of impending doom struck Little Four, and although the
                                            stage was deathly cold, his clothes were totally soaked in sweat. In order
                                            to dodge the continuous onslaught of ice cones, he had already been far
                                            outdoing his best efforts, and by this time he had already expended more
                                            than fifty percent of his own Heavenly Energy, and more so, a huge amount of
                                            spirit energy. However, he knew that he had to continue, to persist to the
                                            end.</p>
                                        <p>Trusting in his instincts that things were going to go badly, Little Four
                                            instantly reacted. The wings behind his back opened to their maximum
                                            capacity as he launched himself into the air at top speed, rising swiftly in
                                            flight.</p>
                                        <p>Another thirty six ice cones flew out again, speeding towards the thirty six
                                            thick ice pillars. This time, the fresh new ice cones were actually a deep
                                            blue colour, obviously the Heavenly Energy held within was far beyond that
                                            of the previous ones in both quality and quantity.</p>
                                        <p>“Explode.” The next moment, the thirty six new deep blue ice cones struck the
                                            thirty six ice pillars, causing another round of loud explosions. The ice
                                            cones and pillars had exploded abruptly, spraying ice dust and shards across
                                            the entire stage. At the same time, a violent and wild torrent of Water
                                            Attribute Heavenly Energy swept across the stage like a giant tsunami
                                            wave.</p>
                                        <p>This Skill by Han Bing was one he had created on his own, with the Cone of
                                            Cold as a basis, and was called Frozen Sacrifice[1. And so, I learn the
                                            lesson of translating the title before finishing part three :P Remember when
                                            I said祭坛 was sacrifice and not priest, yup guess it was titled after the
                                            skill name. Anyway, since his nickname is also 寒冰祭坛, I’ll leave his nickname
                                            as Frost Priest, and the skill name as Frozen Sacrifice]. Its sheer power
                                            and strength was so vast that even a normal Lower Level Zong Stage (7
                                            Jewels) Heavenly Jewel Master might not be able to use a skill of matching
                                            power. More importantly, as this skill was based on multiple merging and
                                            evolution of the low level, it would only expend about thirty percent of his
                                            total Heavenly Energy, yet its power would be beyond what his entire
                                            Heavenly Energy expenditure could normally grant. Furthermore, it was an
                                            Area of Effect skill!</p>
                                        <p>When the fight first began, Han Bing did not even think that he would be
                                            forced to use this Frozen Sacrifice Skill, and he originally thought that
                                            after a few mergers of Cone of Cold, he would be able to take down Little
                                            Four. However, as time passed, Little Four was just too cunning, and his
                                            impossible movements were just too difficult to lock down.</p>
                                        <p>Han Bing did not want to waste any more time, and winning by having Little
                                            Four run out of energy would be a humiliation to himself. As such, he
                                            finally chose to use his self-created ace skill, and AOE skill that would
                                            definitely take down this crafty opponent. At the same time, he could let
                                            the other Great Saint Lands see the power of their Blood Red Hell.</p>
                                        <p>If Lan Feng had not lost the first fight, perhaps Han Bing would not have
                                            used such a powerful skill, but the humiliation of that lost had ignited his
                                            pride and anger. In his heart, he would not entertain anyone giving affront
                                            to the dignity of the Blood Red Hell. When he released this Skill, a killing
                                            intent had already been sparked in his heart; he wanted to kill a chicken to
                                            scare the monkeys [2. Direct translation of an idiom, basically to kill
                                            someone as a warning to the rest], to show everyone, to show the Fei Li
                                            Battle Team, that to defy the pride of a Great Saint Land was not to be
                                            without cost.</p>
                                        <p>The thirty six huge ice pillars did not all explode at the same time, instead
                                            doing so in a rhythmic fashion, and in a particular order. In this way,
                                            their combined explosive power soon formed a terrifying ice vortex; not only
                                            was the explosive power astonishing, it also caused the entire temperature
                                            of the surroundings to plummet even further.</p>
                                        <p>This Frozen Sacrifice skill was varied and full of change, and the explosive
                                            power was all encompassing and yet able to be directed as per his will. Han
                                            Bing had indeed spent a lot of time and effort in creating and mastering
                                            this skill, and it was his pride and joy.</p>
                                        <p>When the intense explosion rang out, all the Battle Teams in their respective
                                            Rest Houses could see clearly that the entire diamond-rock stage had turned
                                            an icy blue, the cold in the air spreading to them, chilling them to the
                                            bone. For a Water Attribute skill to be used to such an extent, it could
                                            already be said to be at an ultimate extreme.</p>
                                        <p>The Consolidated weapon in Little Four’s hand had disappeared. As soon as he
                                            sensed the incoming danger, he had reacted instantly. Alas, in that same
                                            instant, a terrifying explosion and ensuing cold reached his feet.</p>
                                        <p>With his life hanging in the balance, Little Four’s mind raced to find a
                                            solution. His reaction had already been lightning quick, managing to almost
                                            get out of the area of effect; as the Frozen Sacrifice struck, he was
                                            already thirty metres into the air, at least managing to avoid the major
                                            brunt of the blast. Alas, he was still caught in the edges of the explosion,
                                            and in midair, he was almost left vulnerable.</p>
                                        <p>At the last moment, Little Four abruptly used both wings to wrap around his
                                            entire body, before he did something completely unexpected.</p>
                                        <p>In a sudden movement, he flung out his hands, a waterskin appearing in his
                                            hands and bursting apart, and a spray of water was quickly sprayed around
                                            his body.</p>
                                        <p>The temperature around the stage was unbelievably cold at that point, and
                                            even though Little Four had already wrapped his wings around himself, as the
                                            water appeared, it immediately froze around his body, forming a block of ice
                                            around him.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, Little Four’s weird action of spraying water actually had a
                                            linchpin effect. Although his entire body was frozen in the block of ice,
                                            the destructive effects of the explosion were further reduced by the ice
                                            around him, only causing his body to be flung savagely higher into the air,
                                            reaching almost a height of sixty metres. As the explosion finally
                                            dissipated, he finally fell towards the ground.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, Zhou Weiqing was already halfway out of the Rest House, almost
                                            about to surrender and rescue Little Four, preventing him from crashing into
                                            the ground; at that height, free falling would severely injure or kill
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, no need!” Lin TianAo grabbed hold of him, barely stopping him at
                                            the last second from surrendering.</p>
                                        <p>Han Bing’s thought was almost exactly the same as Zhou Weiqing. When he saw
                                            Little Four take out the waterskin and spray out the water, his eyes were
                                            filled with surprise. He had never dreamed that anyone would use such a
                                            method to weaken his Frozen Sacrifice’s effect, to actually use the effects
                                            of his own cold in order to protect himself.</p>
                                        <p>For a Heavenly Jewel Master to have a Spatial Object was very common, usually
                                            with food, water and other essentials. However, to actually think of such a
                                            plan and execute it at such a critical moment like Little Four, it was not
                                            as easy as it seemed.</p>
                                        <p><i>Even so, do you think you can really escape? </i>Han Bing smirked coldly
                                            to himself. Even if he had managed to escape the majority of the explosive
                                            blast of the Frozen Sacrifice, he had left himself totally frozen and
                                            vulnerable by doing so. After all, with the temperature of the Frozen
                                            Sacrifice, even ordinary water would be frozen as hard as ten thousand year
                                            old Xuan Ice, and it would not be easy to escape from that. Furthermore, in
                                            his eyes, Little Four’s body should already be frozen stiff, unable to break
                                            free.</p>
                                        <p>As long as the block of ice fell to the ground, then Little Four would
                                            shatter into pieces together with the block of ice. At the same time,
                                            another ice cone formed stealthily, point upwards right to where Little Four
                                            would land.</p>
                                        <p></p>
