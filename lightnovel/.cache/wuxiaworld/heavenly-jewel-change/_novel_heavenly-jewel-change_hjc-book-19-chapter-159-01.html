                                            compared to single target Skills of the same level. However, it was clear
                                            that this Skill was not just good in its area effect, even its sheer power
                                            was unbelievable. Just a single Hell’s Angel had not only broken the Wolf
                                            Cavalry troop’s sabre formation, it also wiped out a large number of them.
                                            Seeing the dark purple light slowly dissipate, another bright illusory
                                            figure started to appear above Zhou Weiqing’s head, replacing the previous
                                            one. This time, it was a purple red colour, as the figure of the Demonic
                                            Dragon Lady appeared out of nowhere, with an even more powerful
                                            presence.</p>
                                        <p>No order was required. The wolf cavalry troops scattered like crazy in all
                                            directions. Who knew what crazy Skills would come next.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er and Lin TianAo quickly caught back up to Zhou Weiqing, who
                                            watched the enemy retreating with the Heavenly Skill Image of the Demonic
                                            Dragon Lady above his head. After they regrouped, they headed towards the
                                            Gold Crow and Berserker Tribes.</p>
                                        <p>Alas for the Wolfman Cavalry troops, how could they have known that the
                                            second Heavenly Skill Image was just a trick, its purpose just to scare
                                            them… and it had succeeded amazingly. The Dragon Silencing Seal was indeed a
                                            powerful Skill, but it was totally useless against ordinary soldiers like
                                            them, let alone so many of them. Only powerful Heavenly Jewel Masters would
                                            be afraid of such a Skill. Of course, with the prior Hell’s Angel, this
                                            bluff was not easily called, and the effect was effective indeed. Soon
                                            enough, they reached the defensive lines of the two tribes.</p>
                                        <p>When the Peerless Battalion had came earlier, the Gold Crow and Berserker
                                            Tribes had instantly noticed it. Especially when the Unicorn Cavalry
                                            Regiment had moved out to attack the Peerless Battalion, the pressure on
                                            them had lessened considerably. Naturally, they had also clearly seen the
                                            dark purple light of the Hell’s Angel and its effect on the Wolfman Cavalry
                                            Regiment. Now that the enemy was retreating, the two powerful tribes also
                                            heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
                                        <p>They had been surrounded and attacked for more than two hours, and though
                                            they had definitely given much trouble to the Wolfman Cavalry and Unicorn
                                            Cavalry Regiments, the two tribes had not remained unwounded. After all,
                                            they were severely lacking in armour and weapons, and no matter how tough
                                            they were, they could not possibly last forever against the continuous
                                            charges of the powerful cavalry units, and several of them were already
                                            critically injured. If not for the timely appearance of the Peerless
                                            Battalion, perhaps their injuries would have increased to the point that
                                            their lines would collapse. By that time, they might even be in danger of
                                            being wiped out eventually, no matter the toll that would take on the two
                                            Regiments.</p>
                                        <p>As they got closer, Zhou Weiqing immediately saw how the tribesmen of the two
                                            Tribes were all injured. The two tribes were rather easy to differentiate,
                                            with the Gold Crow Tribe consisting of more females, with fewer males. As
                                            for the Berserker Tribe, they had a good mix of both sexes, with the males
                                            mostly all with their upper bodies naked, grasping all different sorts of
                                            weapons. Various wounds and injuries could be clearly seen on their bodies,
                                            and right in front of their defensive line there were large numbers of the
                                            WanShou Empire soldier corpses.</p>
                                        <p><i>Too strong...</i></p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing knew that he was as stout and muscular as they were, yet when he
                                            compared himself to the two Tribes, he found that he was nothing compared to
                                            them. From just a single look, he could not even find one less than two
                                            metres tall. All of them were so muscular that they did not even seem human,
                                            with some of the larger ones almost built like mountains, reaching at least
                                            2.5 metres tall, their shoulders broad and thick as city walls.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss!” Ma Qun’s excited voice rang out and the next moment he charged out
                                            with his large Consolidated Assembly Set Shield, pouncing onto Zhou Weiqing
                                            and giving him a bear hug. He was currently covered in blood, and it was as
                                            if he had seen his closest kin when he spotted Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since they reached this place and were surrounded, both Crow and Ma
                                            Qun’s eyes had reddened. They were under so much pressure in convincing
                                            their tribes to migrate and move, and when this had happened, they could
                                            clearly feel their entire tribe’s eyes on them, no matter whether it was
                                            true or not. After all, they were responsible for bringing their tribesmen
                                            here, yet upon reaching they had been greeted with such powerful enemies.
                                            Let alone speaking of the danger of having their entire tribes wiped out,
                                            even if a single of their tribe members were killed, they would be the
                                            greatest sinners of their tribe.</p>
                                        <p>Being hugged by Ma Qun, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that this brother of
                                            his was trembling. Such a stout and muscular fellow, yet he was currently
                                            giving off such a weak feeling, obviously totally drained of strength from
                                            the long fight.</p>
                                        <p>“Good bro, don’t worry, our reinforcements will be coming soon. I will
                                            definitely bring your tribes safely to our new camp.” It was no time for
                                            lengthy explanations, and Zhou Weiqing’s strong and resolute voice brought
                                            Ma Qun a fresh bout of confidence.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, due to the Wolf Cavalry Soldiers being frightened by Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s terrifying Skills, Barthez gave the order to retreat temporarily
                                            and regroup slightly ahead, reforming into a different formation. At the
                                            same time, this gave the Gold Crow and Berserker Tribes a rare and highly
                                            treasured chance to rest.</p>
                                        <p>Two massive figures disengaged from the crowd and walked towards them, both
                                            covered in blood. Along with them came Crow, carrying her massive Gold Crow
                                            Legendary Axes.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Ma Qun stopped hugging and went ahead to receive them.</p>
                                        <p>The two figures together with Crow were a male and a female. The man was so
                                            huge and tall that even with Zhou Weiqing’s size, he had to totally raise
                                            his head to be able to see his features… <i>He is at least a metre taller
                                                than I am! </i>That was Zhou Weiqing’s first thought upon looking at
                                            him. As he looked closer, he could see that the huge man resembled Ma Qun,
                                            and in his large grip, there was an enormous Great Hammer in each hand, much
                                            larger than even Zhou Weiqing’s considerable Dual Legendary Hammers. His
                                            broad muscular chest were filled with many small wounds, and his entire body
                                            was covered with blood. Still, it was evident that most of the blood were
                                            from his enemies.</p>
                                        <p>As for the lady, her figure was even taller than Crow, with a head of short
                                            hair, carry a pair of massive war axes. As the two of them strode towards
                                            them, it was definitely an intimidating and valiant looking group.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, let me introduce you. This is my father, our Berserker Tribe Tribe
                                            Leader.” Ma Qun quickly said.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing took a few steps forward and extended his hand to the huge
                                            man.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun’s father gripped the two Great Hammers in a single hand before
                                            extending the empty hand to grasp Zhou Weiqing’s. “My name is Ma Long.” His
                                            voice was loud, deep and rich, with an almost slight metallic tone to it.
                                            Just a few words, yet Zhou Weiqing’s ears were almost ringing with that.</p>
                                        <p>“Uncle Ma, good to meet you. I’m sorry that we have come so late, we never
                                            expected that your arrival would coincide with the WanShou Empire’s
                                            attacks.” Zhou Weiqing said with an apologetic look on his face.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s hands were not small, but in the middle of Ma Long’s massive
                                            hand, it was as if it was totally enveloped, like a baby’s hand.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing felt a firm grasp and a large strength applied. However, his
                                            face did not change, and he too applied more pressure, not going on the
                                            offensive but just maintaining his grip without allowing Ma Long’s strength
                                            to overwhelm him.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Long continued slowly increasing the pressure, his gaze fixed upon Zhou
                                            Weiqing though he did not speak.</p>
                                        <p>After a moment, surprise slowly showed on Ma Long’s face. He felt as if Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s hand was a tough bedrock; no matter how much force he applied,
                                            Zhou Weiqing would respond with an equal strength. At this point, he was
                                            already using seventy percent of his strength, but looking at Zhou Weiqing,
                                            he was smiling with an honest look, not flinching or showing any sign of
                                            weakness at all.</p>
                                        <p>“Very good, no wonder that little brat Ma Qun was praising you so much. That
                                            strength, it is indeed impressive.” Ma Long finally let go of his grip,
                                            looking at Zhou Weiqing approvingly as he nodded.</p>
                                        <p>“Let me try.” The middle aged lady warrior who had came together with Crow
                                            passed the axes to Crow, taking a large stride forward to Zhou Weiqing. She
                                            was even more direct, not hiding the fact that she was about to test Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Crow quickly piped out: “Weiqing, this is my mother.”</p>
                                        <p>The middle aged lady warrior was even more straightforward and forthright,
                                            saying: “My name is Hong Yu, you can call me Aunty Hong Yu. Crow said that
                                            your strength is even greater than hers, let me see for myself.”</p>
                                        <p>As she said that, she extended her hand out, one that was no smaller than Ma
                                            Long’s.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Please kindly guide me Aunty.” As he
                                            said that, he extended his hand out without batting an eye.</p>
                                        <p>They were fully pitting physical strength, as such neither side released
                                            their Power Jewels.</p>
                                        <p>Hong Yu was unlike Ma Long; as soon as the two gripped palms, Zhou Weiqing
                                            instantly felt a surge of power come from her. His expression changed
                                            slightly, and he dared not be careless and quickly focused his full
                                            attention. Instantly, a surge of power came from deep within, and the skin
                                            of their two palms where they met immediately turned pale from the sheer
                                            strength between.</p>
                                        <p>“Alright, alright… Hong Yu, do you really think that your strength is greater
                                            than mine?” Ma Long said exasperatedly. With a swift tap of his left Great
                                            Hammer onto the two tightly gripped palms, Zhou Weiqing and Hong Yu released
                                            their grip at the same time.</p>
                                        <p>Hong Yu glanced at Ma Long and said: “What? Are you unwilling to concede? Of
                                            course your strength is not comparable to mine. If you dare, don’t enter
                                            your Berserk state, and we can just compete purely in physical strength, how
                                            about that?”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Long said angrily: “Hmph, if you have the capability, bring down your
                                            weight and mass to an ordinary human level!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s lips twisted awry as his heart spasmed slightly. It looked
                                            like these two were not too harmonious normally.</p>
                                        <p>At the side, Crow suddenly burst into giggles before saying: “Weiqing, don’t
                                            mind them. My mother and Uncle Ma are just too used to arguing all the time.
                                            In truth, they are very good friends.” Ma Long glanced at Crow and said
                                            exasperatedly: “In those days past, if not for your father hijacking my
                                            love, you will not be my daughter in law, but my daughter!”</p>
                                        <p>Hong Yu responded exasperatedly: “Bullshit, as if I would fall for you? Stop
                                            dreaming. Be careful, or I will report your words to sis[1. Ma Long’s
                                            wife].”</p>
                                        <p>To Zhou Weiqing’s surprise, such a stout and muscular berserker warrior like
                                            Ma Qun, upon hearing Hong Yu’s words, he actually turned back with a guilty
                                            look. His voice lowered much obviously, as she said: “Hmph, who knows what
                                            you were thinking, you are so large, yet you can fall for such a tiny
                                            man.”</p>
                                        <p>Hong Yu said angrily: “Shut your mouth! If you dare mention him again, don’t
                                            think I won’t kill you.” Zhou Weiqing could only intervene at such a moment.
                                            After all, they were still not in a good state, and who knew if the WanShou
                                            Empire would send reinforcements as well. “Two Tribe Leaders, we still have
                                            not escaped danger yet, we should leave first before continuing such
                                            conversation.”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Long furrowed his brow and said: “Those Wolf Cavalry soldiers… they still
                                            number at least seven to eight Battalions worth of men. How can we leave
                                            like that?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “You all retreat while protecting your tribesmen. I will
                                            lead my men to cover your retreat.”</p>
                                        <p>“Your men?” Both Ma Long and Hong Yu were slightly puzzled, and they couldn’t
                                            help but look to the distance.</p>
                                        <p>No matter the two Tribes or the Wolfmen Cavalry Regiment, they could still
                                            see the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment in the distance surrounding and attacking
                                            the small Peerless Battalion troop.</p>
