                                            same time, shoulder pauldrons appeared, connecting and fusing with his Yin
                                            Yang Giant Spirit Palms.</p>
                                        <p>The Heart Mirror also appeared behind his back, at the center area where his
                                            heart would be. Front and back, the Heart Mirrors in the center glittered
                                            with bright light, strange dragon-like tattoos shimmering faintly from
                                            within. When the Heart Mirror appeared, a strange, unique aura burst forth
                                            from Zhou Weiqing, and in that instant, it was as if he had warped into an
                                            ancient Titan with infinite ancient power, his entire aura changing. The Yin
                                            Yang Giant Spirit Palms were also connected to the Heart Mirror by the two
                                            gold chains, and once the connection was set, the dark gold light seemed to
                                            come to life, pouring strength into Zhou Weiqing. Even under the Demonic
                                            Change State, he could clearly sense his power and strength growing
                                            explosively.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as his cultivation level had broken through to the five-Jeweled
                                            stage, Zhou Weiqing had not hesitated to Consolidate the Fourth piece of his
                                            ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set that he had gotten from the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Island previously. Improving his power was of utmost importance to
                                            him, and naturally he would not delay in such an important addition to his
                                            arsenal.</p>
                                        <p>As Long Shiya had the ‘Hate Sky No Handle’ Legendary Set, he was relatively
                                            familiar with the usage of Zhou Weiqing’s ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ Legendary
                                            Set. After all, both were of the same origin, and while there were some
                                            differences, his experience was more than sufficient to cover that. As such,
                                            he had explained the miraculous usage of the Heart Mirror to Zhou Weiqing.
                                            The name of that Heart Mirror was the ‘Source of Strength’, and it was one
                                            of the main core components of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set. It
                                            did not have any other attached or imbued Skills, and all it did was a pure
                                            Strength boost, as well as the main effect of joining all the other pieces
                                            together. The more Legendary Set pieces Zhou Weiqing had, the greater the
                                            effect it would have, and the greater the boost to strength as well. At the
                                            same time, it would naturally also help protect his chest/heart area and his
                                            internal organs. As for how much the total strength boost would eventually
                                            be, even Long Shiya was not able to confirm.</p>
                                        <p>Appearing together with the Source of Strength was naturally the Dual
                                            Legendary Hammers. Seeing his enemy charge forward, the crying-face Hammer
                                            in Zhou Weiqing’s right hand slammed upwards as he shouted: “Open!”</p>
                                        <p>*BOOM*</p>
                                        <p>To the jaw-dropping surprise of all the watching onlookers, Zhou Weiqing
                                            burst forth with a unbelievably terrifying power, despite the fact he had
                                            been on the back foot all this time.</p>
                                        <p>The addition of the two God Tier Consolidated Equipment’s boost, and more
                                            importantly the Source of Strength’s boost in joining the Yin Yang Giant
                                            Spirit Palms and Dual Legendary Hammers, along with Zhou Weiqing’s own
                                            personal strength and Demonic Change State, it had already brought his pure
                                            strength to a new height.</p>
                                        <p>The ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set was definitely the best Legendary
                                            Set for Strength Attribute Heavenly Jewel Masters, and how could it be so
                                            simple. Long Shiya had once told Zhou Weiqing that if he could wear the
                                            entire Legendary Set, even if his cultivation level did not reach the
                                            Heavenly God Tier, his strength would far surpass the Heavenly God Tier
                                            powerhouse Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord.</p>
                                        <p>The overall boost from the Source of Strength was just too insane, bringing
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s strength to a terrifying state instantly. With the Source of
                                            Strength, it had finally unlocked the true potential of the ‘Hate Ground no
                                            Handle’ Legendary Set.</p>
                                        <p>The Dragon Head Staff and the crying-face Hammer slammed into each other, and
                                            Gu YingBing felt a massive strength instantly explode against his Dragon
                                            Head Staff, causing its large dragon head top to fly upwards uncontrollably,
                                            causing his entire body to leave the ground along with it.</p>
                                        <p><i>How was that possible? </i>That was the first thought in Gu YingBing’s
                                            mind. In the next instant, it was Zhou Weiqing’s turn to charge forward,
                                            having activated his Tornado Strike.</p>
                                        <p>At such a critical moment, Zhou Weiqing could not even afford to use the Six
                                            Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts. After all, to the current him, the effect
                                            of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts was still not comparable to his
                                            various powerful Stored Skills in tandem.</p>
                                        <p>The Tornado Strike caused Zhou Weiqing to speed up, and at the same time, a
                                            Curse of Doom landed on Gu YingBing. Zhou Weiqing was able to use his
                                            Hammers to unleash the Skills one after the other without any delay, using
                                            the short opportunity where Gu YingBing’s body had been knocked upwards, and
                                            he just threw several Control Skills as quickly as he could on Gu
                                            YingBing.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was extremely clear that the only chance he had to win was to
                                            explode forth with all his power at once, making use of his short term
                                            explosive power that had worked so well for him thus far, as well as his
                                            many powerful Skills able to unleash as much damage as possible in a short
                                            amount of time. That would allow him the seize the opportunity while Gu
                                            YingBing was not going all out. Only then would he be able to defeat the
                                            powerful young Lion Prince.</p>
                                        <p>The Fetters of Wind and Absolute Delay fell upon Gu YingBing one after the
                                            other, causing his entire body to slow down and freeze momentarily. At the
                                            same time, the laughing-face hammer on his left hand turned a bluish purple
                                            as he had already started imbuing it with the Lightning Suffering Skill as
                                            he charged forward. As for his true attack, it was hidden in the right
                                            hammer, the crying-face hammer shimmering with three colours. Wasn’t it just
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s strongest offensive attack, the Dark Demon God Lightning?</p>
                                        <p>In just that short moment of time, Zhou Weiqing had unleashed seven powerful
                                            Skills. More so, after training in the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts,
                                            he was able to unleash these Skills to their strongest potential of his
                                            level.</p>
                                        <p>However, at this moment, Zhou Weiqing could clearly see that above Gu
                                            YingBing’s head, a piercing gold light sprang forth. A pure white Heavenly
                                            Skill Image of an Angel with six wings appeared. The pale gold light turned
                                            into several halos, descending from the sky and covering his body.</p>
                                        <p>A Heavenly God Tier Skill? Zhou Weiqing was caught by surprise. However, he
                                            quickly made the judgement that it too was not a Heavenly God Tier Skill, as
                                            the Heavenly Skill Image of the white six-winged Angel was similar to his
                                            own Heavenly Skill Images. Without question, this was also a Skill that was
                                            infinitely close to the Heavenly God stage, but just beyond.</p>
                                        <p>Instantly, the Fetters of Wind and Curse of Doom effects both vanished. Gu
                                            YingBing withdrew his Dragon Head Staff calmly and unhurriedly, not even
                                            caring about the hammers Zhou Weiqing were striking down upon him. Instead,
                                            his Dragon Head Staff sliced down from above, striking down savagely to his
                                            head.</p>
                                        <p>Right at this moment, Zhou Weiqing had two choices. Although the Dragon Head
                                            Staff was extremely long, but Zhou Weiqing had launched his attack first, so
                                            he could still ensure his attack would definitely land first. However, even
                                            if he did so, he would still be facing that gold halo which looked so
                                            powerful. If his own attack was unable to break through the defense of that
                                            Skill, then he would be taking Gu YingBing’s blow for nothing. The second
                                            choice would of course be to save himself first and abandon his own
                                            attack.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing did not think that even if he was wearing several God
                                            Tier Consolidated Equipment and was in the Demonic Change State, he would be
                                            able to take his enemy’s blow head on. At the same time, he was just too
                                            familiar with such disgusting Skills that were close to the Heavenly God
                                            Tier stage, and he was almost certain that his own attack would not be able
                                            to break through that defense. As such, he quickly made his choice,
                                            instantly sending the Hammers upwards, the crying-face Hammer in front and
                                            the smiling-face Hammer behind, using them to receive Gu YingBing’s Dragon
                                            Head Staff.</p>
                                        <p>Another loud explosion. This time, Zhou Weiqing did not have the advantage,
                                            as the gold light around Gu YingBing also extended through his hand and
                                            covering the staff. At the same time, his entire Dragon head Staff also lit
                                            up, boosting his strength considerably.</p>
                                        <p>Both Zhou Weiqing’s feet sank deep into the ground, his right arm going numb.
                                            The influence of the first fist had now come into effect. Although he had
                                            not felt pain due to his Demonic Change State earlier, and his recovery rate
                                            was indeed powerful, in such a sheer contest and clash of strengths, any
                                            minor disadvantage would be multiplied several times over.</p>
                                        <p>The greatest shock to Zhou Weiqing was not all that, but rather that all his
                                            imbued Skills had totally no effect. The Lightning Suffering Skill on the
                                            smiling-face Hammer was instantly dissipated by the gold light, and the
                                            Skill that he had been depending on so much, the Dark Demon God Lightning,
                                            also disappeared after it was struck by the Dragon Head Staff.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was definitely not in a good state, but Gu YingBing was not
                                            feeling great either. The sheer power held within the two Hammers were
                                            indeed unbelievably terrifying, especially with the boost from the Tornado
                                            Strike, causing his offensive power to increase substantially. At this
                                            moment, Gu YingBing’s arms were both aching and numb, as he was sent
                                            staggering back six, seven steps.</p>
                                        <p>Facing a five-Jeweled opponent, being forced to such a degree was a true
                                            insult, real shame. Furthermore, he had even used his most powerful
                                            defensive Skill, the Divine Guardian Angel, to block Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            attacks.</p>
                                        <p>The Divine Guardian Angel was actually already at the Heavenly God Tier
                                            Stage, and in order to Store such a Skill, Gu YingBing had paid a heavy
                                            price. Even with his powerful Bloodline powers, he had barely succeeded. In
                                            this, Zhou Weiqing had actually judged the Skill wrongly, as it was truly a
                                            real Heavenly God Tier Skill, not a ‘False’ one like he had expected.
                                            However, it was because Gu YingBing’s current Heavenly Energy cultivation
                                            level was not sufficient to unleash the Skill to its full potential, as a
                                            result it had not seemed as strong as it could have been.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing had unleashed a whole chain of Skills onto Gu YingBing, he
                                            found that he had no other choice but to use this powerful defensive Skill
                                            to protect himself. That Zhou Weiqing’s strength was just too terrifying…
                                            just like how Zhou Weiqing did not dare get hit by Gu YingBing’s Dragon Head
                                            Staff, in the same vein, Gu YingBing also did not dare let Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            Dual Hammers strike him without any defense. As such, he could only turn to
                                            this Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Standing back firmly, Gu YingBing’s expression was extremely ugly. Gripping
                                            his Dragon Head Staff tightly, he pointed to the front, and abruptly his
                                            eyes turned bloodshot. He muttered something, but Zhou Weiqing was not able
                                            to hear what he had said clearly, and in the next instant, Gu YingBing’s
                                            golden-red mane flew out like it was in an explosion, and his entire body
                                            expanded in a burst of muscle, as an intense aura and killing intent came
                                            out from within to surround him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not realise but the change that had came upon Gu YingBing
                                            was the totemic bloodline abilities that the WanShou Empire Beastmen had,
                                            just like how the Wolfmen had used previously. However, this totemic ability
                                            of his was definitely one of the strongest in the entire WanShou Empire,
                                            known as the Lion King Transformation. Although the Lion King Transformation
                                            was not comparable to the Demonic Change State, it was still able to allow
                                            Gu YingBing’s speed, strength and Heavenly Energy and control to all be
                                            boosted by a considerable amount.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing also flew into action. He knew that things might not go well for
                                            him today, but he would never give up without pitting his all. During the
                                            time of the Lion Prince’s Transformation, he used the Blink Skill once more,
                                            and in a flash he appeared right before Gu YingBing. However, this time,
                                            Zhou Weiqing had already stealthily kept his Dual Legendary Hammers, using
                                            his Yin Yang Giant spirit Palms as he grabbed towards Gu YingBing’s
                                            shoulders.</p>
                                        <p></p>
