                                            and with the Four Great Saint Attributes combined, would there be any
                                            change.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly asked: “So… what is the result? Was there any
                                            change?”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er nodded, saying: “Yes, of course there was. Otherwise, why would I
                                            stay for so long by your side. Before I knew it, it’s already three
                                            years…”</p>
                                        <p>Speaking up to that point, she hesitated a moment before changing the topic:
                                            “When I’m with you, especially when in contact, the two Saint Attributes
                                            that I have will be activated and roused up by your two Saint Attributes,
                                            indistinctly forming a unique, new energy field. Thus far you have not been
                                            able to sense this as you have not entered the Zun Stage yet, but I was able
                                            to quietly cultivate in this energy field, and in doing so being able to
                                            absorb the purest form of the world’s energy. That is the reason why I had
                                            no need to eat or drink, and this pure energy is more than able to sustain
                                            and nourish me. In doing so, it also imbued my body with much more spirit,
                                            strengthening and spiritualizing it. If not for that energy field, do you
                                            really think your Immortal Deity Technique is sufficient to let you break
                                            through to three Jewels in a mere three years, to the state where you are
                                            almost reaching four Jewels? Although your Immortal Deity Technique is quite
                                            miraculous, it is still not at the point where you can cultivate so
                                            rapidly…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said rather nonchalantly, as he did not really agree: “Is it
                                            really that fast? Compared to you, Little Witch or Shangguan Xue’er… none of
                                            you are that much older than I am, and you are already at the six or seven
                                            Jeweled cultivation level. I’m merely at the three-Jeweled cultivation
                                            level… how could it be considered fast by any stretch of the
                                            imagination?”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er pursed her lips, saying: “Undoubtedly, our cultivation levels are
                                            much higher than yours… but have you thought about how we… the heirs,
                                            members of the direct bloodline, or core disciples of the Great Saint Lands
                                            actually train and cultivate?”</p>
                                        <p>“From the time that we are one month old, our little bodies are immersed in
                                            all sorts of treasures, medicines in order to give us a head start and build
                                            a strong and powerful foundation, improving our physiques. At the age of
                                            three, we start cultivating Heavenly Energy, and before the age of five,
                                            most of us have already Awakened our Heavenly Jewels. After that, the rest
                                            of our young lives are spent in the specially chosen training grounds which
                                            have the densest atmospheric energy for our absorption. To us, we do not
                                            have any childhood, with every single day of our lives spent either
                                            cultivating… or cultivating. We spend all those years doing nothing but
                                            that, persevering, training with all our might. Coupled with our own innate
                                            talent and the fact that we do not have to worry about Consolidating
                                            Equipment or Skill Storing, that is the reason why we are able to reach such
                                            heights at our age. It can be said that even for the Great Saint Lands, to
                                            foster and train disciples like ourselves takes an astronomical cost. Each
                                            generation, only a few select disciples will have that opportunity. That’s
                                            why the Blood Red Hell will not let you off so easily since you all killed
                                            Han Bing… you cannot imagine how much they have spent in developing a talent
                                            like him…”</p>
                                        <p>When she spoke of having no childhood, Tian’er’s eyes revealed a faint
                                            sorrow.</p>
                                        <p>“As I spent more time with you, I began to enter my Transformation Phase.
                                            That was also the reason why I spent so much time sleeping. Originally, for
                                            us Heavenly Beasts, the Transformation Phase is considered one of the most
                                            dangerous for us, and we usually only go through it with the protection of
                                            our elders and family guarding us. Even so, it is an extremely dangerous and
                                            painful process, not to mention long, before we actually succeed in
                                            Transforming. However, this time, due to the strange energy field between
                                            us, generated by the Four Great Saint Attributes, my Transformation Phase
                                            did not have any bottleneck, and I entered it with relative ease.”</p>
                                        <p>“Soon after, my cultivation level made astonishing progress, advancing by
                                            leaps and bounds; during that evolving, I even broke through the
                                            seven-Jeweled Stage. That was truly a miracle; after all, when I was young,
                                            I was actually very naughty and playful. My father doted on me, and although
                                            I did spend a lot of time cultivating, it was definitely not comparable to
                                            someone like Shangguan Xue’er. Yet, I was still able to catch up to her in
                                            such a short period of time, reaching the seven-Jeweled stage. This… is the
                                            power of the Four Great Saint Attributes energy field. If this continues, I
                                            estimate that it will not take me another five more years before I can start
                                            attempting to breakthrough to the Heavenly King Stage… and perhaps become
                                            the youngest ever Heavenly King Master in the world today! I believe that
                                            similarly to its aid to my Transformation Phase, it will also reduce the
                                            bottlenecks in breaking through to the Heavenly King Stage, and it will
                                            prove much less difficult than for any other Heavenly Jewel Master.”</p>
                                        <p>Pausing as she spoke up to that point, a yearning look entered Tian’er’s
                                            eyes, though it was quickly replaced by a complicated look.</p>
                                        <p>“Father once told me that if I want to gain something, it will always come at
                                            a cost. In the past, I did not understand what he meant… but now that I have
                                            spent several years with you, I think I have slowly began understanding the
                                            meaning.”</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing… do you know? In order to gain the greatest benefit for my
                                            cultivation, I should have killed you.” Tian’er continued faintly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started, shocked by the sudden proclamation, as he felt an
                                            abrupt cold on his back.</p>
                                        <p>“At that time, when I had just completed my Transformation Phase, if I had
                                            killed you then and drained you of your spirit, soul and blood… perhaps, by
                                            now, I would already be much more powerful than Shangguan Xue’er. However, I
                                            was unable to take action.”</p>
                                        <p>“I kept telling himself that the reason I did not take action was because I
                                            needed to continue using the Four Great Saint Attributes energy field for
                                            cultivation… that it would not be too late to kill you after I had broken
                                            through to the Heavenly King Master Stage. But… I knew that I was lying to
                                            myself, giving myself excuses for what I knew to be fact - that I could no
                                            longer bring myself to kill you.”</p>
                                        <p>As she spoke those words, her eyes reddened. Indeed, as she told Zhou Weiqing
                                            all of this, it was also the first time that she had truly faced her
                                            feelings head on. Looking at this little rascal in front of her, her heart
                                            struggled with itself.</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou Weiqing, your Demonic Change State is truly different from any before,
                                            unlike what others may think, it isn’t just as simple as being attributed to
                                            a First Generation Heavenly Demon Master. Within your bloodline lies the
                                            aura of an unbelievably powerful and high ranked Heavenly Beast, such an
                                            aura and scent that I have not seen before in my life. I can confirm that
                                            this Heavenly Beast is also a tiger-type, and definitely of equal or higher
                                            rank as us Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers. It is also that scent and aura
                                            within your bloodline that caused me to…”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er last few words that she had almost said it was actually ‘start
                                            falling for you’. She was not trying to make an excuse, but was indeed
                                            telling the truth. After all, Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers were the
                                            spiritual leaders and holy beasts of the entire WanShou Empire, considered
                                            the top bloodline of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, especially since it was the
                                            bloodline of the current Mountain Lord. They were extremely proud of their
                                            own bloodline, and of themselves, feeling like their bloodline was the most
                                            noble and powerful in the entire world. Even when considering the Divine
                                            Spirit Flame Lions, second only to them, and usually considered almost at
                                            the same level as them, Tian’er was a little disdainful. That was one of the
                                            reasons why she ran away from her arranged marriage. Although she said that
                                            the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline of Zhou Weiqing’s was perhaps equal to
                                            her own Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger, it was actually at a much higher
                                            ranking level. This was also one of the reasons she stayed so long by Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s side, causing her to slowly be entangled and trapped in a web of
                                            emotions and feelings.</p>
                                        <p>If it were any other person, it would have been extremely difficult, perhaps
                                            impossible, to move Tian’er. Instead of saying Zhou Weiqing had moved her,
                                            perhaps it could be said that his bloodline had conquered her. In the
                                            Heavenly Beast world, the phrase conquer was very apt. In order to win a
                                            mate, power and strength was of primary importance in the Heavenly Beast
                                            world. When Zhou Weiqing had gone through his own second evolution, just the
                                            bloodline essence and aura had given Tian’er an irresistible, unbreakable
                                            feeling. This was especially further accentuated that day when Zhou Weiqing
                                            and Shangguan Bing’er had that one crazy night, causing Tian’er to be filled
                                            with a strong desire as well. Of course, this was something that she would
                                            never ever tell Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing did not know anything about such inside information
                                            regarding bloodlines. Hearing Tian’er speak of it, he just assumed she was
                                            shy and it was just her excuse, and he just grinned widely and kept
                                            silent.</p>
                                        <p>“What are you laughing at? Hmph, you scoundrel!” Tian’er gave our dear Little
                                            Fatty a swift kick.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued grinning as he said: “Heh heh, I’m just overjoyed at
                                            my own suave attractiveness! Even such a beautiful lady like Tian’er can
                                            fall for me!”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er gave a loud humph and said: “Like means like, so what about it? We
                                            Heavenly Beasts are very direct, I have indeed fallen for you, and I have
                                            chosen you as my mate. Therefore, you have to protect me in future, and work
                                            hard for my sake as well.”</p>
                                        <p>“Ahh?” Zhou Weiqing stared at her, mouth agape. He had only been teasing her,
                                            and had definitely not expected such a response. For all the girls that he
                                            had met previously, even those with a more open-minded, forthright
                                            characters like Little Witch and Ming Hua would never have said something
                                            like that outright. Yet, Tian’er had done just that so very naturally,
                                            saying that she had fallen for him without beating around the bush, and that
                                            had definitely caught him by surprise.</p>
                                        <p>Heavenly Beasts usually had active and direct characters, daring to love and
                                            hate outright, not fearing to show their emotions. Although Tian’er felt a
                                            little bashful inside, she still self-examined her own feelings and
                                            emotions; since her identity had already been exposed by Zhou Weiqing, she
                                            decided to simply face her own truths and speak out forthrightly.</p>
                                        <p>Love was something that had to be fought for. This was the world of Heavenly
                                            Beasts. They would not give up their love just because of something so petty
                                            like bashfulness.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing originally had a wicked, teasing grin on his face, but hearing
                                            Tian’er admitting that she liked him so readily, it was his turn to be
                                            embarrassed.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er gave a humph as she said: “Bing’er did not strictly restrict you from
                                            having other women… within reason. In our Heavenly Snow Mountain, the
                                            stronger the Heavenly Beast, the more mates they would have. This is the
                                            same for both male or females. The more mates, the more it shows one’s
                                            power, ability and status. My father has several dozen concubines, and not a
                                            single one of them would dare to have another man. Whoever dares touch them
                                            would be a challenge to my father. If one day, I find that you are not able
                                            to protect me, or perhaps do not have anything for me to like any further, I
                                            will also leave you. In truth, this is not just our Heavenly Beast’s world,
                                            though we might be more obvious about it. It is also the same in your human
                                            world… power is everything in the end.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er’s words and perspective could be said to be seemingly very different
                                            from any human’s perspective, and Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but twitch
                                            helplessly, and he could not resist saying: “Does that mean that… besides
                                            me… you will look for other men?”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er saw his gloomy look and felt a surge of glee in her heart: “That will
                                            be up to you and your ability. If you have the ability to make me commit
                                            wholeheartedly to you, just like my father, I will naturally not look for
                                            anyone else. Just like, if you can ‘conquer’ the three Shangguan sisters, I
                                            will be very proud of you! Ohh, but I have to warn you… if my father
                                            discovers my whereabouts, my fiancé will definitely come looking for me. If
                                            you are actually serious about marrying me, you will have to get through two
                                            extremely tough barriers. The first is my fiancé; you will have to defeat
                                            him in fair combat, to convince him with your power. The next would be my
                                            father, you will have to somehow gain his approval.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing asked tentatively: “What happens if I can’t defeat your
                                            so-called fiancé, or perhaps not able to win the approval of your
                                            father?”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er lifted her hands, rubbing them softly across Zhou Weiqing's cheek as
                                            she said gently: “In that case, I’m afraid there is only one ending.”</p>
                                        <p>Death. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing knew what the ending she was alluding to would
                                            be, and a wave of depression struck his heart.</p>
                                        <p>Although the Heaven’s Expanse Palace hadn’t treated him well in regards to
                                            Shangguan Bing’er, being rather overbearing in their attitudes. However, no
                                            matter what, they had not treated him badly, rather gently in fact, with
                                            only the condition that he defeated Shangguan Xue’er, and without even
                                            giving him a time limit! Yet, Tian’er’s side was much more savage… If he
                                            lost, that would be the end of him for good. Zhou Weiqing couldn't help but
                                            sigh inwardly. <i>I have really gone looking for trouble for nothing, why
                                                did I have to go unmask her, isn’t that adding on to my long list of
                                                troubles?</i></p>
                                        <p>Despite his inward complaints, he still lifted his hand and drew Tian’er into
                                            his embrace, leaning down frankly into a kiss.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er, who had been so forthright in professing her love just moments ago,
                                            was instantly flustered, and she quickly slipped out of his arms in a swift
                                            movement, saying: “What are you doing?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: “If your fiancé comes to kill me, and I
                                            haven’t even touched you yet, isn’t it such a huge disadvantage to me?
                                            Quick, come here, let your hubby collect some interest first.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er giggled, saying: “In your dreams! If you want to touch me… sure! But,
                                            you must follow our Heavenly Snow Mountain rules. You’ve already gotten past
                                            the most difficult obstacle, as I have already falen for you. In order to
                                            get intimate for me, it is very easy; as long as you can defeat me, that
                                            means you have the power to conquer me, and you can do anything you want
                                            with me. As for now… you’re still far from it.” As she said that with a lilt
                                            in her voice, she gave him a provoking, teasing waggle of her finger.</p>
                                        <p>Exasperated, Zhou Weiqing said huffily: “You just wait. It won’t take long,
                                            and I’ll let you know my power. Hmph, your little bottom better watch
                                            out!”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er smiled faintly, saying: “I’m waiting eager for such a day, waiting
                                            for you to conquer me. But as for now, we better get through this Heavenly
                                            Jewel Tournament of yours first…”</p>
                                        <p>The two of them had already stayed at their starting area for almost an hour,
                                            but besides the panther which had attacked them earlier, it had been
                                            relatively quiet.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing savagely ‘molested’ Tian’er with his gaze once through, before
                                            finally saying: “So… does that mean you have are actually willing to help
                                            me?”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er said: “You are my man, of course I will help you. This Lustre Spatial
                                            Realm is truly strange. Normally, it stands to reason that any Heavenly
                                            Beast would be able to sense the high ranking Heavenly Beast aura from both
                                            you and I, and would never dare to attack us. Only a Heavenly Beast of at
                                            least Heavenly King Stage and higher could possibly dare do such a thing.
                                            Yet, just now, that little panther actually dared to ambush us… it must be
                                            due to the unique properties of this Spatial Realm.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded in agreement, saying: “Indeed. We should also make our
                                            move now, we’ve spent enough time here. I wonder how the rest are doing, I
                                            hope they are all okay. We should just be careful and start looking around
                                            for signs of the other team members, and hopefully we can all gather
                                            together as soon as possible.” As he said that, he lifted his head to look
                                            at the sun high up in the skies of the Lustre Spatial Realm, before turning
                                            to a nearby tree and striking out at it, leaving a mark. Although these huge
                                            trees were extremely tough, with Zhou Weiqing’s power, it wasn’t too
                                            difficult to strip it of some bark.</p>
                                        <p>*Swoosh* Tian’er leapt up into the air, transforming back into the little Fat
                                            Cat as she did so, landing perfectly on Zhou Weiqing’s shoulder. Her
                                            beautiful purple eyes were filled with a warning look as she said: “Don’t
                                            you dare touch me willfully, otherwise I’ll hit you so hard that your teeth
                                            fall out!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, saying: “No touching means no touching. Wait
                                            until I conquer you, I’ll definitely touch you everyday! Hmph! I’m a man
                                            with high aspirations!”</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing knew that clarifying Tian’er’s true identity as well as
                                            the reasons she had found him and clung to him, as well as affirming their
                                            relationship, would definitely bring him many problems in the future, Zhou
                                            Weiqing did not care now. He was definitely in a good mood; at least that
                                            invisible yet yawning gap between the two of them had now vanished into thin
                                            air, and he had also found out about Tian’er’s true feelings. As for the
                                            problems from the Heavenly Snow Mountain… it wasn’t as if he lacked problems
                                            now right? Pressure and stress also brings about motivation and impetus -
                                            Zhou Weiqing was extremely clear about this point.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued moving ahead slowly and carefully, his senses extended
                                            to maximum capability as he probed the surrounding forest. Every time he
                                            walked a certain distance, he would leave a mark on one of the trees. He had
                                            a very good memory, and coupled with an estimation of direction using the
                                            shadow of the trees from the sun rays, he was able to start plotting a rough
                                            map of the area in his head, slowly perfecting it as he walked around the
                                            forest.</p>
                                        <p>In doing so, Zhou Weiqing walked for almost an hour without meeting any
                                            problems, but he did not dare relax. He knew that for the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament to be held here, it definitely had its share of danger.</p>
                                        <p>“Fat Cat, let’s climb up a tree to have a look from the canopy. That way, we
                                            will be able to see into the distance, and hopefully discover something.”
                                            Zhou Weiqing said to Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat nodded, saying: “That sounds good, let’s head up then. But you should
                                            be careful, I just keep having the premonition that this Lustre Spatial
                                            Realm isn’t as simple as it seems, it definitely holds some untold
                                            dangers.”</p>
                                        <p>After nodding in agreement, Zhou Weiqing looked around for a suitable tree to
                                            climb. Settling upon a particular thick and stout large tree, he began his
                                            climb. His hands forming a claw shape, he struck the ground hard with his
                                            right foot, propelling himself into the air in a quick burst. His hands
                                            swiftly struck the tree trunk several times to continue his upwards
                                            momentum, and in a few swift strikes he was up in the canopy layer of the
                                            tree.</p>
                                        <p>Looking down from the vantage position of the tall tree canopy, it was
                                            definitely a large improvement in vision and line of sight. Looking ahead,
                                            it was a seemingly endless sea of green as the tree canopies formed a
                                            ‘field’ in the sky, the expanse of the breathtakingly beautiful blue heavens
                                            almost seeming translucent, almost transparent.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing muttered to himself: “Such a huge forest… and to only bring in
                                            thirty two people… in just a month’s time… it should be impossible for any
                                            of us to meet without some crazy stroke of luck. If my guess isn’t wrong,
                                            this Heavenly Jewel Tournament is for us to compete on our survival skills…
                                            that is to say overall strength. Of course, there is also a large element of
                                            luck here… if anyone were to meet a Heavenly King Stage Heavenly Beast upon
                                            entering the Spatial Realm, they would probably be eliminated
                                            instantly.”</p>
                                        <p>In the short time that he was muttering to himself, Zhou Weiqing’s thoughts
                                            were suddenly interrupted. Looking ahead in shock, he saw that the skies in
                                            the distance had totally turned red. The next moment, a deep red flash
                                            accompanied by a searing heat crossed the skies, almost filling the entire
                                            immense sky!</p>
                                        <p>As the temperature of the air rose drastically, the startled Zhou Weiqing
                                            ducked down under the branches into the cover of the leaves. The sudden rush
                                            of searing hot air passed by in a flash, and its passing caused several of
                                            the smaller branches sticking out to be burned to crisp, and the top leaves
                                            of canopy also turned a withered yellow.</p>
                                        <p>“What was that?!” Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in shock, as he asked Fat Cat.</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat was also in a state of shock. “That… that… it seemed like… like… a
                                            Skill… a Heavenly Beast Skill…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stared in shock, mouth agape, before finally gathering himself
                                            to speak: “That’s impossible right? That red light just now covered almost
                                            ten thousand square metres… can a Heavenly Beast actually use such a
                                            terrifying skill of such an area of effect?!”</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat looked at Zhuo Weiqing, taking in a deep breath as her eyes gleamed:
                                            “Yes… my father can.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing felt as if he had just swallowed a whole chicken’s egg, his
                                            voice changing as he said: “Dearest… are you trying to tell me that… that…
                                            in this Lustre Spatial Realm… there is a Heavenly God Stage Heavenly
                                            Beast…?”</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat gave a bitter smile and said: “I’m afraid that is the reality of the
                                            situation. Do not ask me why as well… I do not know either.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing carefully craned his head out of the canopy to look once more,
                                            and he was shocked to see in a huge creature in the distance, flying towards
                                            their direction.</p>
                                        <p>It was at least a hundred metres long by his estimation, covered in a dark
                                            red scales, with a pair of huge wings extending from its back, looking
                                            slightly similar to a large iguana with massive claws.</p>
                                        <p>It… was … a dragon!</p>
                                        <p></p>
