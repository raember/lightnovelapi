                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said passively: “You are not giving me face, you are giving the
                                            ZhongTian Empire face right? It is not what I want, but that for the current
                                            us, even this reception is not sufficient. Principal Cai Cai, when I was
                                            studying at the Fei Li Military Academy, you have always treated me well and
                                            given me many opportunities, and I truly do respect you. As such, I must
                                            inform you about something serious… please do not let your Fei Li Empire do
                                            something they will regret.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Cai Cai fell silent. She suddenly felt that
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s words were just so similar to what Ming Yu had said to her
                                            previously. Could it be that there was some connection between him and Ming
                                            Yu? That should not be possible… after all Ming Yu was from the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect. This Zhou Weiqing already had some connection with the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace, how could he possibly have any connection with the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect?</p>
                                        <p>There was nothing much left to be said, and Cai Cai subconsciously maintained
                                            her silence. Although she had been given control over the entire situation,
                                            there was a limit to it, and what Zhou Weiqing wanted was not something she
                                            could just decide on a whim. To have the Fei Li Emperor come out personally
                                            to receive them, that was nearly impossible. If the Fei Li Empire did that,
                                            wouldn’t it be tantamount to admitting weakness to the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire?</p>
                                        <p>The drilling ground was not far from the east gate, and both sides were
                                            mounted. Before long, they had reached it. Currently, the entire drilling
                                            ground was empty, as some of the Royal Family Cavalry had ridden ahead to
                                            clear the zone. Under Shen Wang’s command, besides those who had originally
                                            already been there to escort the diplomatic party, another five thousand of
                                            the Royal Family Cavalry Troops had also arrived there. If the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire party attempted to do anything against the Fei Li Empire, he was
                                            confident that their numbers were sufficient to take care of them.</p>
                                        <p>The Royal Family Cavalry troop was no ordinary army unit; for a soldier to
                                            enter such a formation, not only did they have an absolute clean background,
                                            their family had to be of Fei Li descent, and to be clean as well. More so,
                                            they had to have participated in the border wars against the WanShou Empire,
                                            to have achieved sufficient military awards before they even had the chance
                                            to be accepted. Even after that, there would be a series of very strict
                                            tests and training before one could finally become an official member of the
                                            Royal Family Cavalry troop. Amongst the entire Fei Li Military, they had the
                                            best pay and treatment, and could be said to be the finest elites amongst
                                            them. The entire Royal Family Cavalry troop consisted of fifty thousand
                                            warriors, and were the ace troops that were only under the command of the
                                            royal family.</p>
                                        <p>The five thousand soldiers of the Royal Family Cavalry were arrayed in a
                                            formation around the drilling ground, split into five formations of a
                                            thousand men each, covering the four viewing stands and the center VIP
                                            platform, fully enclosing the entire area.</p>
                                        <p>Towards this, Zhou Weiqing did not really care much. Cai Cai brought the
                                            other officials to the VIP stand, but Zhou Weiqing did not follow. Up until
                                            now, Princess Difuya had not left the carriage.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, Cai Cai could tell that Difuya was just a figurehead in this
                                            scene, and the true leader of this diplomatic party was Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Wang did not follow the Fei Li contingent up into the viewing stands,
                                            remaining at the bottom of the drilling ground. He was mounted upon a tall,
                                            sturdy warhorse, his silver armour giving him a suave and noble air. His
                                            fierce gaze rested upon Zhou Weiqing. As the Vice Commander of the Royal
                                            Family Cavalry troop, it had been ages since he had been provoked like this.
                                            Towards Zhou Weiqing, he only felt a sense of disdain. A mere youth of less
                                            than twenty years of age, just because he had some strength, he actually
                                            dared to challenge me? He is virtually asking for death!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing jumped off his Ghost Demon Horse steed. Turning around, he took
                                            a long look at the large Heavenly Bow Empire flag swaying in the gentle
                                            winds. Taking a deep breath, he quietly reminded himself in his heart, his
                                            fists gripped tightly in resolution. <i>It is time to begin the revival of
                                                my homeland!</i></p>
                                        <p>Striding in large steps towards Shen Wang, Zhou Weiqing only stopped when he
                                            was about thirty yards from him. Extending his right hand, he made an
                                            inviting gesture.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, Cai Cai’s voice rang out from the VIP stand. “Commander
                                            Zhou, you are after all here for a diplomatic visit, and since you are
                                            already here, it is not a fortuitous sign if blood is drawn. How about
                                            making this a duel about exchanging pointers. If you are really able to
                                            defeat Vice Commander Shen, I will get him to apologize to you, how about
                                            that?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked towards the VIP stand and said arrogantly: “In that case,
                                            I will give this face to Your Highness. However, this Vice Commander Shen
                                            has insulted my Empire. If I win, he has to kowtow towards my Empire’s flag
                                            when he apologizes.”</p>
                                        <p>Before Cai Cai could open her mouth, Shen Wang had already said coldly:
                                            “Fine. If you can defeat me, I will kowtow and apologize!” He was an old
                                            hand on the battlefield, and he could naturally tell that Zhou Weiqing was
                                            trying to rile him up. In such a case, he might as well just agree to his
                                            terms; not only could he present the generosity and bearing of a general of
                                            a large Empire, it would also show his absolute confidence in himself. In
                                            truth, he did not think he would lose at all.</p>
                                        <p>At last, a faint smile flashed across Zhou Weiqing’s face. “Very good, simple
                                            and direct, I appreciate that.” As he said that, Zhou Weiqing’s hand slashed
                                            across the air, and the two triangles appeared in midair.</p>
                                        <p>Being much older and stronger, Shen Wang would naturally not attack first.
                                            Especially since he was in front of Princess Cai Cai and so many other
                                            officials, how could he not want to show off? Towards Cai Cai, he had always
                                            harboured feelings towards her, but Ming Yu’s performance in the military
                                            was just too outstanding, and he had never had a chance to display his own
                                            talents. However, just in terms of personal strength, Ming Yu was no match
                                            for him!</p>
                                        <p>Although Shen Wang did not attack first, that did not mean he would be
                                            careless in front of Zhou Weiqing. After all, he was an experienced soldier.
                                            His nine sets of Heavenly Jewels appeared, glowing brilliantly as the
                                            swirled around his respective wrists.</p>
                                        <p>The Physical Jewels on his right wrist were the same type as Zhou Weiqing’s,
                                            the Icy Jade Jewels that denoted the Strength Attribute. As for the
                                            Elemental Jewels on his left wrist, they were the Tourmaline that denoted
                                            the Wind Attribute. A Wind and Strength Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, at
                                            the nine-Jeweled stage. He truly had the strength and right to be confident
                                            and proud. It was no fluke that he was the Vice Commander of the Royal
                                            Family Cavalry troop, and it was not because of any special background that
                                            allowed him to advance to such a position. He had fought his way to this
                                            position, and it was his strength that allowed him to do so.</p>
                                        <p>After releasing his Heavenly Jewels, Shen Wang could also see that Zhou
                                            Weiqing had also done the same, with his six sets of Heavenly Jewels. Around
                                            his right wrist, there were the six Icy Jade Jewels, the same type as his
                                            own. However, around Zhou Weiqing’s left wrist, Shen Wang also saw six
                                            Tourmaline Elemental Jewels of the Wind Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, this was due to the Ring of Concealment that Tang Xian, the mother
                                            of the three Shangguan Sisters, had given him in the past. Zhou Weiqing knew
                                            that the Fei Li Empire did not know much about his true power, most of them
                                            not even linking him to the Zhou Weiqing that had led the Fei Li Battle Team
                                            to victory in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament! As such, he would definitely
                                            seize any opportunity to mislead his opponent.</p>
                                        <p>As Shen Wang saw that Zhou Weiqing was only at the six-Jeweled stage, the
                                            onlooking officials on the viewing platforms could also see it. For a time,
                                            looks of disdain, contempt and scorn filled their gazes as they looked at
                                            Zhou Weiqing, some even whispering to each other about how these young
                                            whippersnappers were reckless and foolish, asking for death!</p>
                                        <p>Of course, whether or not Zhou Weiqing was foolish, asking for death, or not…
                                            one could only know after an actual fight. However, it was unfortunate that
                                            Shen Wang had also been fooled by Zhou Weiqing’s outward appearance… just
                                            like he had expected.</p>
                                        <p>Of all the Fei Li Empire onlookers, only Cai Cai frowned and furrowed her
                                            brow when she saw the six Jewels of Zhou Weiqing. She clearly remembered the
                                            time when Zhou Weiqing had led the Fei Li Battle Team to win the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Tournament years ago. At that time, his cultivation was only at the
                                            four-Jeweled stage… in fact most of the Tournament had been spent with him
                                            at the three-Jeweled stage!</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai was all too familiar how difficult the Heavenly Jewel Tournament was,
                                            and what kind of monsters of the younger generation they would face there.
                                            Those were all the finest elites of every single Empire, especially the
                                            cream of the crop of the younger generation in the Five Great Saint Lands.
                                            Under such a circumstance, the mere four-Jeweled Zhou Weiqing had still been
                                            able to create history and lead the Fei Li Battle Team to defeat all these
                                            powerful opponents, bringing back the championship. Now, at the Six-Jeweled
                                            stage, how far had his power grown then? If he did not have any confidence,
                                            would he dare come here to cause trouble? To actually challenge Shen
                                            Wang?</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, that little brat’s cultivation speed was just too astonishing. It
                                            hadn’t even been two years since he had left the Fei Li Empire, and his
                                            cultivation level had already jumped unbelievably, from four Jewels to six
                                            Jewels! That was totally shocking, almost unprecedented and unheard of in
                                            history! At this moment, Cai Cai was truly starting to believe Ming Yu’s
                                            words. Coming into conflict with Zhou Weiqing was truly not a wise idea.</p>
                                        <p>However, things had already developed to such a stage… and by now they had no
                                            choice but to fight first. Furthermore, even though Cai Cai had a very high
                                            opinion of Zhou Weiqing, she still did not see how it was possible that a
                                            six-Jeweled stage Zhou Weiqing could defeat the nine-Jeweled Vice Commander
                                            Shen Wang.</p>
                                        <p>After all, as the cultivation stage of a Heavenly Jewel Master grew further
                                            and further, the gap was greater and greater! The difference between six
                                            Jewels and nine Jewels was far greater than four Jewels to six Jewels! Not
                                            to mention, Shen Wang was an experienced fighter in his own right even
                                            amongst the nine-Jeweled stage, otherwise how could he reach the rank of
                                            Vice Commander?</p>
                                        <p>Shen Wang did not disappoint Cai Cai. Although he did not attack first, he
                                            did not wait to summon out his Consolidated Equipment.</p>
                                        <p>The moment Shen Wang released all his Consolidated Equipment, Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            mouth curled upwards in a hint of disdain. This was no longer him acting,
                                            but it was truly him looking down upon the Equipment. After all, do not
                                            forget the kind of people he had been mixing around with!</p>
                                        <p>Without question, with Shen Wang’s status in the Fei Li Empire, he would have
                                            all nine pieces of Consolidated Equipment for his nine Jewels. However, just
                                            from his Consolidated Equipment, one could tell how lacking the Fei Li
                                            Empire was in the profession of Consolidating Equipment Masters, and the
                                            lack of resources and actual Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>The nine Consolidated Equipment that Shen Wang was wearing were also Set
                                            Equipment, however they were three pieces per set, three sets in total, with
                                            some Socketed as well.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst the three Sets, one was clearly crafted by a Zong Stage Consolidated
                                            Equipment Master, while the other two were just Grandmaster stage ones. Even
                                            so, from Shen Wang’s expression, it was clear that he was extremely proud of
                                            his equipment. Indeed, in the Fei Li Empire, for a Upper Level Zong Stage to
                                            have such a gathering of Consolidated Equipment, it was already extremely
                                            good.</p>
                                        <p>Although Shen Wang’s Equipment was separated into three Consolidated Sets, it
                                            was already sufficient to cover most of his body protectively. Helmet, two
                                            shoulder pauldrons was a set. Chest, girdle and Kilt another Set. The final
                                            Set was the Zong Stage one, which included his weapon, a longsword, and the
                                            two greaves respectively. It appeared that this Set was not complete,
                                            probably lacking two combat boots. Of course, his cultivation level was far
                                            from reaching that. Indeed, for him to reach Heavenly Emperor Stage was
                                            highly unlikely, perhaps even impossible.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Shen Wang release all nine pieces of Consolidated Equipment
                                            without hesitation, Cai Cai secretly relaxed slightly, sighing in relief.
                                            Earlier, her words to Zhou Weiqing were undoubtedly to regain some goodwill,
                                            but it was also to tell Shen Wang not to underestimate Zhou Weiqing, but
                                            also not to kill him.</p>
