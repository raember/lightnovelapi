                                            The trebuchets did not launch a single large rock, instead each of them
                                            having six decent sized rocks. As they were flung up into the air in an arc,
                                            all in the same direction but spreading out as they flew. For these rocks,
                                            thrown at a distance of two hundred yards, even ordinary Heavy Cavalry
                                            soldiers would be severely wounded or even killed if struck.</p>
                                        <p>The greatest weakness of the trebuchet was its accuracy. For the first
                                            volley, the majority of the rocks smashed ineffectually onto the city walls,
                                            causing a round of explosions. However, just the small percentage that
                                            actually hit the top of the walls managed to take the lives of eight
                                            ordinary Heavenly Bow Empire soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>This was time for the show of the Peerless Regiment Heavy Cavalry once more.
                                            Out of all the soldiers, these rocks from the trebuchets posed the least
                                            threat to them. For a time, the large spiked maces or giant battle axes
                                            waved in the air, and any of the large rocks that came near them were
                                            smashed into bits instantly.</p>
                                        <p><i>F**k your sister!</i> Zhou Weiqing screamed angrily in his heart. All
                                            around his body, a bluish purple light burst forth as he nocked another
                                            arrow. This time, his arrow was not shot at any particular target, instead
                                            towards the skies. Instantly, along with a chain of explosions, a large
                                            patch of lightning struck down from the skies, fully enveloping the six
                                            trebuchets. Immediately, many of the soldiers in charge of reloading the
                                            trebuchets fell to the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Thousand Lightning Strikes.</p>
                                        <p>The destructive power of this Skill was not strong, definitely not sufficient
                                            to destroy the trebuchets. However, it was enough to disable the Kalise
                                            Empire soldiers who were manning it. Left with no choice, Zhou Weiqing could
                                            only use such a method to delay the attacks from the trebuchets.</p>
                                        <p>However, since the Kalise soldiers had reached the two hundred yards, they
                                            could also begin their actual charge. No matter how skillful the Peerless
                                            Regiment soldiers were, they only numbered two hundred. Facing the charge of
                                            several thousands at once, even with their firing rates they could only take
                                            down a portion of enemies. They could only watch as the rest of the Kalise
                                            Empire armies charged to the walls despite their best efforts.</p>
                                        <p>One by one, siege climbing ladders were placed onto the walls as soldiers
                                            scrambled to climb up. Right behind them, the plodding giant battering ram
                                            cart still moved on, advancing slowly and steadily like an unstoppable
                                            force.</p>
                                        <p>This was the first time Zhou Weiqing truly felt the terror of the
                                            battlefield. No matter how powerful he was individually, he still could not
                                            take care of everything that was happening. When he tried to deal with the
                                            trebuchets, the battering ram cart moved on unimpeded. Even the delay on the
                                            trebuchets did not last long, as more soldiers ran forward to continue
                                            reloading them. Taking a deep breath, a thick purplish black light began to
                                            gather crazily about him, and with an explosive shout, Zhou Weiqing flew up
                                            once more.</p>
                                        <p>Ten days ago, the purplish black light which had shocked everyone, taking
                                            thousands of lives instantly, it appeared once more. When the six giant
                                            wings spread out and the illusory light spread across the entire field with
                                            the oppressive pressure… the charging Kalise soldiers suddenly stalled,
                                            stunned.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, some of the soldiers just turned and ran, not even caring
                                            about their orders. In their haste to flee, they did not even care about
                                            their siege ladders, just dumping them on the ground in the sudden trample
                                            of movement.</p>
                                        <p>This was something that Zhou Weiqing did not expect. The fear the Hell’s
                                            Angel caused even before he unleashed it was actually at such a level.</p>
                                        <p>For the first time since the battle had started, a cold smile flashed across
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s face. However, it was not one of happiness, but one filled
                                            with a cold killing intent.</p>
                                        <p>This time, the Hell’s Angel Skill did not show any signs of coming to life.
                                            Naturally, Zhou Weiqing did not dare to infuse Saint Energy within once
                                            more, and it was just an ordinary Skill that was close to the Heavenly God
                                            Tier stage. A thick darkness aura welled up, and with the powerful control
                                            of his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, the terrifying skill that had
                                            been stored into his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was not transformed
                                            into a purplish black arrow nocked to his Overlord Bow.</p>
                                        <p>Above Zhou Weiqing’s head, the illusory figure of the Hell’s Angel flapped
                                            its wings hard, and along with the explosive release of the Overlord Bow and
                                            the shrill screech, the arrow flew towards the trebuchets.</p>
                                        <p>This time, none of the Kalise powerhouses dared to block it. When they saw
                                            the image of the Hell’s Angel above Zhou Weiqing’s head, they had been
                                            scared silly. After all, it was just too similar to what had happened ten
                                            days ago, and they did not even care to be curious why the Heavenly Emperor
                                            on the Heavenly Bow Empire side would actually dare to break the rules
                                            again. The powerhouses were the ones who fled the fastest, and within
                                            moments they were back at the end of the army lines.</p>
                                        <p>One could clearly see that currently, all of the Kalise soldiers who had been
                                            charging forward were now retreating like the waves which had crashed upon a
                                            shore. Indeed! Who would be willing to withstand the terrifying force of
                                            nature they had witnessed ten days ago?!</p>
                                        <p>Even Zhou Weiqing did not realise the awe and deterrent power his Hell’s
                                            Angel Skill suddenly had. In that moment, he felt laugher almost bubbling up
                                            to the front. Without question, as the enemy started retreating, the
                                            pressure on their defense was greatly reduced.</p>
                                        <p>*Boom*</p>
                                        <p>Once again the explosive effect of the Overlord Bow caused another violent
                                            detonation. Next, the six trebuchets were totally swallowed by the purplish
                                            grey swirls of air that rose from the very earth, the terrifying corrosive
                                            nature and destructive power causing the six trebuchets to disintegrate into
                                            thin air. Some of the slower Kalise Empire soldiers who did not flee in time
                                            were also swallowed up.</p>
                                        <p>Once again, the Kalise Empire soldiers were stunned silly, but this time for
                                            a totally different reason. Indeed, the Hell’s Angel Skill of Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            was extremely powerful, and the area of effect was not small at all;
                                            otherwise it couldn’t have swallowed all six trebuchets at once. However,
                                            when compared to the horrifying image ten days ago and the deep impression
                                            it left, this current Hell’s Angel was like child’s play! The Hell’s Angel
                                            that had been brought to life was just at a whole different level, and the
                                            force that defied nature did not appear once more. However, by the time they
                                            realised it, the Kalise forces had already retreated back past the three
                                            hundred yard range.</p>
                                        <p>With that, the Peerless Regiment soldiers on the wall burst out laughing at
                                            the sight. They did not hesitate to make full use of the opportunity, arrow
                                            after arrow chasing after their enemies’ butts, and wave after wave of
                                            Kalise soldiers fell like wheat harvested in the fields.</p>
                                        <p>From the start of the battle until now, out of the twenty thousand Kalise
                                            soldiers on this front, at least three thousand would never witness the dawn
                                            tomorrow. In stark contrast, the Heavenly Bow Empire had only lost a few
                                            dozen soldiers. Such a huge difference in death and wounded could only be
                                            found in a siege battle.</p>
                                        <p>The Kalise Empire army command were no fools, after a short moment of shock,
                                            they immediately reacted. Indeed! Since the Heavenly Bow Empire had already
                                            received strong warnings, how could they possibly dare to use the same
                                            terrifying Skill again? Instantly, a series of strict orders were issued
                                            again, and only then did the Kalise soldiers barely stabilize and begin to
                                            turn back, charging back towards the Crescent City once more.</p>
                                        <p>However, in just the matter of retreating and returning, the Kalise had left
                                            behind another thousand or so corpses before they reached the city walls
                                            again. The Peerless Regiment soldiers were all godly archers, and they might
                                            not be able to take down the Heavy Infantry soldiers in the front, but that
                                            did not stop them from focusing on the backlines. Furthermore, there were
                                            still the ballista turrets. In the extra time given, it was sufficient for
                                            four more salvos from them. Once again, they focused on the siege vehicles,
                                            and by now only a dozen or so actually remained fully intact.</p>
                                        <p>However, despite all of the success, this also spelled the end of some of the
                                            main defensive advantages of the Crescent City. The true siege had begun,
                                            and once again siege ladders were thrown against the wall, arrows flying up
                                            and towards them like swarms of locusts.</p>
                                        <p>Without a doubt, the destruction of the trebuchets meant they were facing
                                            much less pressure, but the waves of attacks from their enemies were just as
                                            crazy as before.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavy Infantry soldiers had accomplished their goals. Actually attacking
                                            the walls were not their forte indeed, as climbing would be difficult. As
                                            such, they slowly moved back to continue escorting other Kalise soldiers to
                                            charge to the front once more.</p>
                                        <p>On top of the city walls, the piles of fallen logs and large rocks which had
                                            been prepared over the past months were now put to good use, thrown down to
                                            smash into the climbing foes. This also caused many casualties on the Kalise
                                            side. However, there were elites mixed within those soldiers, especially
                                            some of the powerhouses who had reached the front along with the ordinary
                                            soldiers. Although the Heavy Cavalry soldiers were still pushing down and
                                            destroying ladder after ladder, they just couldn’t take care of the entire
                                            section of wall.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as the enemies reached the top of the walls, the arrows of the
                                            Peerless Regiment soldiers would no longer be as effective, and they would
                                            have to resort to hand to hand combat. Still, their effectiveness had proven
                                            itself. More than four thousand enemies had fallen by the time the first
                                            Kalise soldier reached the top of the walls, and this was under the fact
                                            that they still had a large number of siege weapons</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Regiment only numbered seven hundred in total, and on this wall
                                            alone, Zhou Weiqing and his men only totalled two hundred and fifty. With
                                            just this two hundred and fifty core of elite soldiers, they had actually
                                            already managed to kill a total of more than ten times their number. For any
                                            defending army, that was already something to be proud of.</p>
                                        <p>However, despite all their resistance, their enemies had still reached the
                                            top of the wall. At this moment, the terrifying combat prowess of the Heavy
                                            Cavalry soldiers truly came into play.</p>
                                        <p>The fifty Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers were spread out along the wall, so
                                            thinly spread that there was only one of them every hundred metres. However,
                                            as soon as any enemy broke through the barricade and reached the top of the
                                            walls, the destructive force of the Heavy Cavalry soldiers would greet
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>This was especially so for the Berserker Tribe warriors, whose performance
                                            stood out strikingly. In terms of destructive powers, perhaps they were
                                            slightly inferior to the Gold Crow Tribe members; after all the large spiked
                                            maces and massive battle axes could not be compared in terms of destructive
                                            power.</p>
                                        <p>However, the length of the spiked maces were far beyond the battle axes, and
                                            these Berserker Tribe members who had inherited a hint of the ancient Titan
                                            Bloodlines, they all stood even taller with a startling arm reach. Even if
                                            they stood there unmoving, the pair of supreme spiked maces in their hands
                                            could reach and area of more than a dozen square metres. As long as enemies
                                            climbed up to the city walls, before they could take action, a terrifying
                                            blow would greet them.</p>
                                        <p>From below the city, it was an even scarier sight. For those Kalise soldiers,
                                            they could clearly see their fellow soldiers who had painstaking climbed all
                                            the way to the top, and within moments, it was as if an entire cart had
                                            slammed into them, their bodies exploding out from the city walls and
                                            smashed several dozen metres away before falling to the ground. Before they
                                            could even land on the ground, they were already mangled corpses.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Heavy Cavalry stood there on the city walls, just like gods of
                                            war. Unmoving bedrocks of the defense which could not fall. As for the rest
                                            of the Peerless Regiment archers, they had long since switched to long
                                            spears, and for some time at least, they were still barely able to hold
                                            their own and defend the city walls. However, they no longer had any excess
                                            energy or time to spare with regards to the enemies outside the wall.</p>
                                        <p>When the enemies had reached the the city walls, Zhou Weiqing had instantly
                                            changed his weapon. Although the Overlord Bow was powerful, it was no longer
                                            important now that they were climbing up. The most important thing now was
                                            to stop them from actually overwhelming the top of the walls.</p>
                                        <p>The two Legendary Hammers in hand, the rest of his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’
                                            Legendary Set worn around him, along with the Dragon-Tiger Transformation
                                            and the wings behind his back. Where there was the most enemies, Zhou
                                            Weiqing would appear there, slaughtering countless numbers of enemies. Even
                                            he did not know how many he had killed, having lost count long ago, and
                                            before his eyes was just a sea of red.</p>
