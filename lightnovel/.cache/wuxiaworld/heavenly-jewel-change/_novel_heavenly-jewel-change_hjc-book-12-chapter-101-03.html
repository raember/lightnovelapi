                                            Skills, Curse of Darkness, Fetters of Wind and Touch of Darkness.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation level was far lower than hers, she was
                                            under the effect of the Absolute Delay, and the three Control Skills managed
                                            to slow her down further as they all took effect.</p>
                                        <p>The fifth arrow that followed was the one that got through her slowed claws,
                                            and was shattered by her protective Heavenly Energy aura. Yet, this was
                                            imbued with one of the most critical skills of Zhou Weiqing’s, the one that
                                            had gotten him through so many tough fights - the Heavenly Lightning
                                            Shock.</p>
                                        <p>Along with the massive ensuing explosion came the powerful effect of the
                                            Heavenly Lightning Shock. Alas, once more, the female ZhongTian Battle Team
                                            member showed her terrifying power. Under the effects of the Absolute Delay
                                            and the three Control Skills, and the sheer power of the Heavenly Lightning
                                            Shock, her Consolidated Equipment should ordinarily have been disrupted and
                                            removed.</p>
                                        <p>However, instead of that happening, she burst forth in full power at that
                                            time, with two strong rays of dark gold light bursting forth from her
                                            Consolidated Claws and Bracers. In the midst of the explosion of the
                                            Heavenly Lightning Shock, her Equipment shuddered and the light dimmed, but
                                            it actually held strong and was not disrupted! She had actually succeeded in
                                            forcibly resisting the Heavenly Lightning Shock Skill!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing, who was currently at the sidelines watching as he continued
                                            recovering his Heavenly Energy, couldn’t help but shout in his heart: <i>Damn!!</i>
                                        </p>
                                        <p><i>This lady is just too terrifying! Even after being affected by so many of
                                            my Skills, she can still resist the Heavenly Lightning Shock?! Ugh… that
                                            throws my plans off that she hasn’t lost her Consolidated Equipment, my
                                            final blow of the Seven Stars Accompanying the Moon might not be sufficient
                                            to take her down after all. </i></p>
                                        <p>Out of the seven arrows, five had already hit. Surprisingly, the last two did
                                            not strike her, instead hitting each other in midair.</p>
                                        <p>Did Zhou Weiqing make a mistake? No, the answer was naturally no.</p>
                                        <p>An almost miraculous sight occurred next; as the two arrows collided with
                                            each other, they each released a green light and silver light respectively.
                                            The two lights merged into one in midair, and that green-silver light
                                            flashed in midair, a small green-silver knife of light striking out towards
                                            the female ZhongTian Battle Team member.</p>
                                        <p>Although she had actually managed to resist Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Lightning
                                            Shock, the Control Skills were still in effect on her. At that point, she
                                            had just spent all her energy, making use of the inherent Skill within her
                                            Consolidated Claws to barely resist the Heavenly Lightning Shock, and was
                                            currently in a state of recovering and off balance.</p>
                                        <p>This silver-green light was naturally Zhou Weiqing’s strongest offensive
                                            skill before he had gotten the Dark Demon God Lightning. It was the Silver
                                            Emperor Spatial Rend, a Fusion Skill of the Silver Emperor Wing Slash and
                                            the Spatial Rend.</p>
                                        <p>When she saw that strike, Little Witch, who had been ready to unleash her
                                            charged up skill in tandem with Zhou Weiqing’s last blow for maximum effect,
                                            was actually so shocked that she missed a beat, slowing down and failing to
                                            strike at the same time.</p>
                                        <p>Seven arrows in rapid succession, with such a chain of effects, with each
                                            arrow imbued with a Skill. More importantly, the last final blow was
                                            actually a Fusion Skill created with two arrows! What kind of amazing
                                            archery was that! This was also the first time she had witnessed Zhou
                                            Weiqing display such abilities.</p>
                                        <p>*Clang* *Wenng*</p>
                                        <p>The Silver Emperor Spatial Rend was still blocked by her claws as she set
                                            them in a crossed position in front of her defensively. Even so, not being
                                            in good condition herself, not only was her charge stopped in her tracks,
                                            her hands were knocked upwards as he broke through her guard.</p>
                                        <p>Yet again, this young lady showed Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch that the
                                            considerable power she had already displayed was not her limit.</p>
                                        <p>Under such an unfavourable situation, she made the best choice she could.</p>
                                        <p>Another two Dark Gold Light sprung up abruptly from her body, one after the
                                            other. The first lasting for a second, before it was followed by the
                                            other.</p>
                                        <p>This time, Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch couldn’t help but have their
                                            expressions change once more.</p>
                                        <p>It was actually another two pieces of God Tier Consolidated Equipment!</p>
                                        <p>God Tier Consolidated Equipment were the absolute top tier of Physical Jewel
                                            Consolidated Equipment, with each having extremely powerful capabilities
                                            worthy of turning the tide in battle. This female ZhongTian Battle Team
                                            member had actually suppressed Little Witch with just a pair of bracers and
                                            clawed gloves, and yet now she had actually released another two God Tier
                                            Consolidated Equipment. The Heaven’s Expanse Palace was just too rich…</p>
                                        <p>Originally, with Zhou Weiqing’s Seven Stars Accompanying the Moon, he and
                                            Little Witch were at the absolute advantage; as long as Little Witch
                                            unleashed her charged-up Skill, they had been confident of winning.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, who knew that their opponent had actually held these two powerful God
                                            Tier Consolidated Equipment in reserve, and with their respective God
                                            Protective Auras, she had saved herself from potential doom. Do not
                                            underestimate just this short time of merely two seconds, not only did it
                                            prevent her from losing there and then, it had also delayed the time so that
                                            most of Zhou Weiqing’s Control Skills had run out, with only the Curse of
                                            Doom still in duration. More importantly, it had given her a short time to
                                            recover slightly.</p>
                                        <p>In fact, she had actually made a minor judgement in error; or perhaps it
                                            would be more accurate to say that Little Witch’s minor error and delay had
                                            actually helped their team instead! Originally, she had judged that Little
                                            Witch would take action right after Zhou Weiqing’s attack had landed. As
                                            such, she had released her Consolidated Equipment God Protective Auras right
                                            after she blocked Zhou Weiqing’s Silver Emperor Spatial Rend, with the aim
                                            of blocking Little Witch’s attack. Both their power levels were extremely
                                            close, and even though it was a powerful charged Skill, she knew that Little
                                            Witch should not be able to break her God Protective Auras so easily.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, her judgement had been awry. Who could have expected that Little Witch
                                            had been so surprised about Zhou Weiqing’s final attack that she had slowed
                                            her attack for a split second. That had resulted her in being able to
                                            witness the start of the God Protective Auras. As such, she continued
                                            holding back her attack for a better time.</p>
                                        <p>This time, a dark gold armored shoulder pauldrons extended from her
                                            shoulders, with its beautiful overhanging protrusions, forming a beautiful
                                            pattern. The shoulder pauldrons extended from the shoulder all the way down
                                            the back, covering most of her back, and a pair of hue gold wings spread out
                                            from the back, with the outer side of the wings being a dark gold colour,
                                            filled with lines of tattoos, and its underside a pure brilliant gold, the
                                            contrasting forming an astonish beauty.</p>
                                        <p>A six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master having four God Tier Consolidated
                                            Equipment, looking to be part of a Legendary Set. That in itself was a huge
                                            statement. This young lady was definitely one of the young powerhouses that
                                            the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had spent much time, effort and resources in
                                            developing!</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, her four God Tier Consolidated Equipment were very different
                                            from other Consolidated Equipments. It was not just the fact that they were
                                            part of a Legendary Set, but more so that her Physical Jewels were mutated
                                            duo Jewels. As such, each piece of Consolidated Equipment was a lot larger…
                                            and correspondingly more powerful as well. This was a massive advantage to
                                            her indeed, allowing her to cover a much greater surface area.</p>
                                        <p>Generally speaking, if a Heavenly Jewel Master wanted an entire set of armour
                                            to cover his whole body, it would require at least ten pieces before being
                                            able to do so. However, from the look of her, it would probably only require
                                            eight pieces to complete cover her, and that was considering the pair of
                                            terrifying claws and the huge wings on her back!</p>
                                        <p>In the instant that the Consolidated Equipment God Protective Aura
                                            disappeared, Little Witch finally launched her attack.</p>
                                        <p>A deep blue light, as if crossing the ages, floating towards her opponent,
                                            brushing against her as if a light kiss from a lover, yet also seeming like
                                            the rain that had been swept along by the winds, soft, gentle, but incessant
                                            and pervasive.</p>
                                        <p>The female ZhongTian Battle Team member had a very serious look on her face.
                                            The two seconds of recovery had bought her time, and also allowed the
                                            effects of the Absolute Delay and other Control Skills to vanish, but the
                                            Curse of Doom was still in effect, and she did not have the time to dispel
                                            it. Furthermore, she was still off balance, and Little Witch was using her
                                            full power in the Demonic Change State. As such, she could only react
                                            hastily.</p>
                                        <p>As the blue light struck the interlocked claws… this time, there was no
                                            violent clash or explosions, just a soft buzzing sound.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch stood still, her body swaying slightly from the impact. The blue
                                            light surrounding her vanished, along with the tattoos. After unleashing
                                            this blow, she was unable to continue maintaining the Demonic Change
                                            State.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, a grey-blue light flashed in the female ZhongTian Battle
                                            Team member’s eyes. She staggered back seven steps, but it was not as simple
                                            as that. Each step she took back, her body seemed to sway a little, as if
                                            she was flowing along in a strong current. In this way, with each step, she
                                            was able to neutralise the power of Little Witch’s attack, bit by bit. As
                                            such, seven steps later, she was finally able to stand upright. Even so, she
                                            couldn’t help but cry out, spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p>
                                        <p>The strange thing was that as soon as the mouthful of blood was spat out, it
                                            warped into a blue-grey light, and vanished into the air. At the same time,
                                            the blue-grey in her eyes also slowly dissipated.</p>
                                        <p>Panting sounds issued out from both Little Witch and her opponent. In this
                                            strike, Little Witch had depleted a large amount of Heavenly Energy, and
                                            similarly her opponent. At the same time, even though this female ZhongTian
                                            Battle Team member had made use of her four God Tier Legendary Set
                                            Consolidated Equipment to withstand the flurry of attacks, she had still
                                            finally been injured.</p>
                                        <p>The entire fight had not been long, but both sides were already exhausted.
                                            Even with Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch working today with all their might,
                                            they had only gained the advantage on this female ZhongTian Battle Team
                                            member, and had not defeated her totally!</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch smiled faintly, saying: “If you had just one more God Tier
                                            Consolidated Equipment, then we would have lost by now. Unfortunately, you
                                            just have the four. If I have not guessed wrongly, this Legendary Set should
                                            be specially designed and crafted for you by the God Tier Consolidating
                                            Equipment Masters of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace right?”</p>
                                        <p>Her meaning was extremely clear. That earlier strike of hers had used up a
                                            large portion of her Heavenly Energy. If the female ZhongTian Battle Team
                                            member had another God Tier Consolidated Equipment, just the Consolidating
                                            Equipment God Protective Aura would have allowed her to block it, instead of
                                            being forced to take the blow, and thus would have undoubtedly give her the
                                            upper hand.</p>
                                        <p>There was a complicated look in the female ZhongTian Battle Team member. All
                                            this while, she had never harboured the thought that she might lose, as she
                                            had utmost confidence in her own power and abilities. In the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace, even Zhan LingTian who was at a higher cultivation level
                                            than her could not take her down easily. Yet… at this current moment, she
                                            was feeling the fatigue of fighting the two.</p>
                                        <p>It wasn’t exactly because of Little Witch in front of her, but more because
                                            of the hidden archer behind - Zhou Weiqing, or rather the combination of the
                                            two. With Little Witch there, even if she wanted to attack Zhou Weiqing, it
                                            was rather out of the question. Yet, with Zhou Weiqing at the side, she was
                                            highly restricted, having to constantly be on the lookout for his supporting
                                            attacks. Currently, she had already used all four of her God Tier Legendary
                                            Set Consolidated Equipment, but at the same time it was also a huge drain on
                                            her Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing slowly walked out from his cover behind the
                                            trees. After Devouring Heavenly Energy from Da Huang and Er Huang, he had
                                            recovered his Heavenly Energy back to his maximum. Of course, that was not
                                            his own Heavenly Energy, and he had to use it very soon, or assimilate it as
                                            his own; otherwise it would be lost. However, no matter what, with the help
                                            of his Devour Skill once more, he had regained his fighting
                                            capabilities.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing, the female ZhongTian Battle Team member’s reaction was
                                            immense, as she stared at him in shock, exclaiming: “What? It’s actually
                                            you?!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh, Little Witch and I are teammates, how
                                            could it not be me? Didn’t you say my arrows weren’t up to speed? How is it?
                                            How does my Seven Stars Accompanying the Moon feel?”</p>
                                        <p></p>
