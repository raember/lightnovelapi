                                            the ZhongTian Bank, and could be used almost everywhere. There were branches
                                            even in the WanShou Empire, and could be said to be the ‘safest’ form of
                                            currency.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, this was the highest class of storage cards, which had a normal
                                            contracting and a blood binding function, which had soulbound the card to
                                            Zhou Weiqing. Only Zhou Weiqing could make use of both bloodline and spirit
                                            energy to gain access to the card. In it was exactly a hundred and one
                                            million gold coins.</p>
                                        <p>“I’m rich, I’m really rich now!” There were gold coins dancing in Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s eyes as they glowed in glee, as he stood at a side grinning
                                            foolishly to himself for almost ten minutes. He almost forgot the pain in
                                            his body, and had to be dragged back by the rest of the Fei Li Battle Team
                                            members to their hotel.</p>
                                        <p>It wasn’t just Zhou Weiqing who lost his cool; every single member of the Fei
                                            Li Battle Team felt as if they were in a dream.</p>
                                        <p>To be able to actually defeat one of the seeded teams, not just by strategy,
                                            but actually defeating their top two powerhouses, such a brilliant victory
                                            was something they had not even dreamt of.</p>
                                        <p>Today’s victory meant that they would actually ascend to the top eight
                                            quarterfinals as the First Position in Group 3. That also meant that their
                                            next opponent would be the second position of another group, which would
                                            definitely not be another team, while the Dan Dun Battle Team would have to
                                            fight against another seeded team!</p>
                                        <p>Even though they had not drawn lots on their opponents yet, the results were
                                            almost a certainty. Without their top two powerhouses, the Dan Dun Battle
                                            Team was almost certainly unable to defeat another seeded team, and would
                                            lose their top four spot for the first time in a long time. As for the Fei
                                            Li Battle Team, they would certainly have a large chance in making the top
                                            four.</p>
                                        <p>This was also the main reason why Zhou Weiqing had suggested that they
                                            challenge the Dan Dun Battle Team in the preliminary heats. After all, they
                                            would have to face a seeded team no matter what, and facing an unprepared
                                            Dan Dun Battle Team was much better than possibly drawing the ZhongTian
                                            Battle Team or the WanShou Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as they returned to their hotel, Zhou Weiqing collapsed onto his bed.
                                            It wasn’t that he did not want to celebrate with his companions, but he was
                                            just too exhausted, and not fully recovered from his injuries yet. He needed
                                            all the rest he could get. Still, even though he fell asleep almost
                                            instantly, he still placed the VIP Storage Card of the ZhongTian Bank on his
                                            forehead, the foolish grin still on his face as he snored away.</p>
                                        <p>Having displayed all his considerable talents in the previous fight, he was
                                            certain that Shangguan Longyin would relay that to Shangguan Tianyue, and
                                            this was indeed Zhou Weiqing’s goal. As such, he could finally get a good
                                            rest. What was more comfortable than a good sleep after accomplishing one’s
                                            goal? Especially since the past few days he had been under much strain and
                                            tension.</p>
                                        <p>It was time to relax for a while.</p>
                                        <p>Nobody came to disturb Zhou Weiqing, and he slept for more than twelve hours,
                                            through the night and into the day before he awoke, refreshed and
                                            satisfied.</p>
                                        <p>However, as soon as he crawled out of bed, he did not go for a bath or even
                                            to look for his companions, instead rushing to the dining hall, polishing
                                            off a huge meal like the wind blowing the clouds away.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s awakening had alerted the other members of the Fei Li Battle
                                            Team, and they soon followed him into the dining hall. However, when they
                                            entered, they did not sit together with Zhou Weiqing, instead sitting at
                                            another corner.</p>
                                        <p>There weren’t that many people in the dining hall, it was barely thirty
                                            percent filled, and most of them were staring with their jaws agape at this
                                            young fellow sitting without nary a care for his image, one foot on another
                                            chair as he gorged away at an insane speed. Naturally, that was Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>It was as if he was a hungry ghost who had been reincarnated for his first
                                            meal in ages.</p>
                                        <p>The other members of the Fei Li Battle Team gave a look as if they did not
                                            recognize him, sitting quietly at their corner.</p>
                                        <p>From Zhou Weiqing’s appetite, the other members could tell that he was
                                            probably recovered, or at least well on his way to recovery. Since Xiao Yan
                                            and Drunken Bao had not taken any action in the entire preliminary heats,
                                            and their injuries were now fully recovered, the entire team was actually at
                                            their maximum after defeating the Dan Dun Battle Team, instead of being
                                            lowered as they had expected. They were indeed fully ready for their next
                                            fight.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, Zhou Weiqing threw his spoon on the table after finishing a last
                                            bowl of fresh seafood soup, exclaiming: “Ahhh, that was good--!”</p>
                                        <p>He was rather loud, startling a nearby customer who spat out a mouthful of
                                            soup onto his friend. However, neither of them dared to flare out at
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was getting stronger and more robust, and it showed in his
                                            impressive physique. After his second evolving, his stature and built had
                                            almost caught up to Lin TianAo. No ordinary person would easily cause
                                            trouble with him.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s cry, the other members of the Fei Li Battle Team
                                            sweatdropped. Little Four said with a disdainful look: “Ahh, such a
                                            disgrace… such a disgrace!”</p>
                                        <p>Crow glanced at him and said: “What so disgraceful? That’s called forthright,
                                            spontaneous! If it were in our Gold Crow Tribe, many maidens would fall for
                                            him!”</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao burst out laughing, saying: “Alas, even Weiqing’s physique will
                                            not be able to endure the six hundred jin weight!”</p>
                                        <p>Crow blushed and lowered her head, saying abashedly: “If we haven’t tried it,
                                            how do you know he will not be able to endure it? In my opinion, Weiqing
                                            will have no problems. Alas, I already have a fiance, if not I will
                                            definitely chase him!”</p>
                                        <p>The usually quiet Xiao Yan said passively: “If you had said that to him a few
                                            moments ago, I’m sure he wouldn’t have been gorging away so happily.”</p>
                                        <p>At that point, Zhou Weiqing walked over with a satisfied look on his face,
                                            saying: “It is never wrong to love someone. How could I be offended by that?
                                            Sis Crow is so beautiful, you all just do not know how to appreciate
                                            her.”</p>
                                        <p>On hearing that, Crow’s eyes widened, and she said: “Weiqing, how about I
                                            retract my marriage and follow you instead? Do not worry, I know you already
                                            have Bing’er, she can be the main wife, and I can be the second. How about
                                            that?”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at her, Zhou Weiqing’s pupils contracted, and he thought to himself:
                                            <i>Sis, how are you small in any way? </i>[1. Second wife is literally 小老婆
                                            Small Wife, he is playing on words again] Of course, he would never say that
                                            out loud, instead saying sternly and righteously: “Crow, that is very wrong
                                            of you. Since you already have a fiance, how can you have such a notion?
                                            That will badly affect the good impression I have of you!”</p>
                                        <p>Crow blushed, then sighed heavily with a helpless look on her face: “Ahh, I
                                            regret meeting you before marriage!” [2. 恨不相逢未嫁时, it is an idiom denoting
                                            regret of meeting a true love only after one's marriage]</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo stood up, an exasperated look on his face as he said: “You guys go
                                            ahead, I’m heading back first. Weiqing, when you’re done here, come over
                                            with the rest to discuss our strategy for the next fight.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not dare tease Crow any longer; if she really decided to
                                            chase him, it would backfire on him instead!</p>
                                        <p>“Come on, let’s head back with Leader to discuss the fight.” As he said that,
                                            he placed an arm around Lin TianAo’s shoulder and quickly walked off with
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao laughed, saying; “Weiqing, that rascal, sometimes I feel like
                                            punching him indeed.”</p>
                                        <p>Xiao Yan said passively: “Agreed.”</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao said: “+1”</p>
                                        <p>Little Four continued: “+1 too!”</p>
                                        <p>Crow paused, then said happily: “If you all beat him up, can I watch?”</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Back in Lin TianAo’s room.</p>
                                        <p>The seven members of the Fei Li Battle Team sat in a circle, and sensing the
                                            hostile looks of his teammates, Zhou Weiqing sat quietly at a corner, like a
                                            punching bag.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo glanced at him, then said: “I’ll summarise our fight with the Dan
                                            Dun Battle Team before we discuss the next fight. Indeed, we did win this
                                            fight, and with that, we have a good chance of entering the top four of the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament. However, I have to say that luck was truly on our
                                            side.”</p>
                                        <p>“If not for a large amount of luck, Little Four would definitely have not
                                            been able to kill that Han Bing. In truth, whether it was to save their true
                                            power, or because they underestimated us, the Dan Dun Battle Team did not
                                            send out a proper formation or their full power. It can be said that his
                                            death was truly for nothing. Now… although Senior Shangguan Longyin has made
                                            us the promise, we cannot guarantee that the Blood Red Hell will take
                                            revenge on our Empire instead.”</p>
                                        <p>“As for the fight between Weiqing and Shen Little Demon…” As he said that,
                                            everyone turned to look at Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo said solemnly: “As a Heavenly Jewel Master, Weiqing, I can totally
                                            understand, and will not blame you, for hiding your true power. If it were
                                            any of us, with so many Attributes, especially the Evil Attribute, we would
                                            also choose to hide it. However, what I cannot forgive is you pitting your
                                            life against Shen Little Demon, especially without informing us, and almost
                                            dying there and then. Have you thought about what it would do to us as a
                                            team? If you fought and died there on the stage, who would plan and
                                            strategize for us? If you fought and died there on the stage, perhaps we
                                            would have been enraged and fought to the death with the Dan Dun Battle
                                            Team, how many of us would have survived then? I repeat the words I said
                                            previously; since I brought all of you here, my goal is to bring all of you
                                            back unharmed. If there is a second time, I will remove you from the team.
                                            Do you understand?”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the grave look on Lin TianAo’s serious face, Zhou Weiqing nodded,
                                            not speaking a word.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo continued: “Alright, enough about that. Now, the actual drawing
                                            lots will be held one day before the quarter finals. Weiqing, do you have
                                            any plan going forward?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, saying: “Without knowing our opponent, I’m
                                            unable to come up with anything concrete. At least we do know that we will
                                            not be facing another seeded team for the next fight. When the water rises
                                            we use earth to keep it back, when the soldiers arrive we use a general to
                                            hold them at bay. [3. Direct translation of chinese idiom. Basically,
                                            meaning ‘Que sera, sera’, or ‘whatever will be, will be'. Face whatever
                                            obstacles as they come along.] I have confidence that we will be able to
                                            face any of the second teams and enter the top four; the only one we need to
                                            be careful of will be the Kalise Empire. After all, they have the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect supporting them. Even if they do not dare to use the secret
                                            techniques of the Heavenly Demon Sect and reveal themselves, they are still
                                            not to be underestimated.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo nodded, saying: “There are four groups, so there is only a quarter
                                            chance of us drawing them. We shall discuss our strategy in greater detail
                                            the day after tomorrow after drawing lots then.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, he swept his gaze around the entire team, before finally
                                            saying softly: “I know that everyone is extremely excited after defeating
                                            the Dan Dun Battle Team. However, I must remind everyone not to get ahead of
                                            ourselves. We still have not reached our goal, the top four, and are still
                                            currently at the top eight. Indeed, we have taken a huge step towards it,
                                            but I need all of you to hold yourselves back. There is time for excitement
                                            and celebration after we have met our goals. If any of you are overly
                                            excited, causing your form to deteriorate, I will not hesitate to stop you
                                            from entering the next fight. Understood?”</p>
                                        <p>“Understood!” The rest of the team chorused.</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing their agreement, only then did Lin TianAo’s face relax, and he
                                            smiled. Turning to Zhou Weiqing, he said: “There are still a few days for us
                                            to rest, and everyone should get sufficient rest. Of course… defeating the
                                            Dan Dun Battle Team is a great team effort… and somebody won a hundred
                                            million gold coins! You all decide what you want to do, I’m heading out
                                            first. I didn’t see anything….”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he turned out and walked out the door, with Zhou Weiqing
                                            staring at him with jaw agape.</p>
                                        <p>The other members also turned their gazes to Zhou Weiqing, green in their
                                            eyes as they looked at him wickedly...</p>
