                                            their training, the Peerless Battalion soldiers managed to chit chat with
                                            the Heavy Infantry soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion rules, pay, treatment… their unbelievable amount of
                                            Jewel Masters and Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, titanium mail and high
                                            quality equipment… all of that was slowly known to the Heavy Infantry
                                            Regiment soldiers, causing no small amount of ruckuss. In fact, some of the
                                            Peerless Battalion soldiers even started spending money to hire some of the
                                            Heavy Infantry soldiers to wash their clothes!</p>
                                        <p>As gossip spread amongst the Heavy Infantry soldiers, and changes occurred,
                                            even Shen Ji was almost on the verge of looking for Hua Feng to speak to
                                            him. However, at that point, the WanShou Empire armies finally launched
                                            their attack…</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Daybreak.</p>
                                        <p>In an entire day, this was the time that most humans were at their most
                                            vulnerable state. The drowsiness of dawn meant that their alertness level
                                            was usually at its lowest. Right at this moment, the WanShou Empire armies
                                            started bearing down upon their enemies. Of the seventeen Regiments, seven
                                            of them charged towards the ZhongTian Northwest Army Camp.</p>
                                        <p>The shrill, urgent cries of the alarms broke the silence of the Northwest
                                            Camp, ringing through the various Legions and Regiments as the emergency
                                            bells rang.</p>
                                        <p>After all these days of tightly strung nerves, the ZhongTian Empire soldiers
                                            were undoubtedly tired and weary. However, they had no choice but to clamber
                                            out of their beddings, getting into their armour with weapons in hand. Their
                                            enemies had finally come.</p>
                                        <p>At the first moment, Oni readied his troops and rallied them for battle.
                                            Getting into their armour was one of the most troublesome things for the
                                            Heavy Infantry soldiers, as they needed time to wear their heavy and
                                            cumbersome armour.</p>
                                        <p>To Oni’s surprise, the Peerless Battalion did not seem to have any differing
                                            actions than usual. It was early in the morning, and the scent of firewood
                                            smoke mixed with sweet scent of milk already rose from the Peerless
                                            Battalion camp, causing anyone who smelled it to feel refreshed and
                                            relaxed.</p>
                                        <p>Oni gave an angry mutter. “Those damn WanShou Empire bastards, they are doing
                                            this on purpose so we have to fight on an empty stomach!”</p>
                                        <p>Very quickly, the ZhongTian Northwest Army had mustered several dozen
                                            Regiments to meet the incoming enemies, their goal mainly to buy time for
                                            their heavy armoured regiments to prepare themselves. The Northwest Army
                                            encampment had long since prepared for this, and their various
                                            fortifications, trenches, traps and various catapults were being manned to
                                            defend against this first wave of WanShou Empire attacks.</p>
                                        <p>To Oni’s anger and frustration, by the time his own Heavy Infantry Regiment
                                            were all fully geared and prepared, there was still no sign of movement from
                                            the Peerless Battalion. As such, he dispatched one of his soldiers to have a
                                            look, who came back to report that the Peerless Battalion soldiers were
                                            still having their breakfast as per usual, enjoying their delicious first
                                            meal of the day as if nothing special was going on.</p>
                                        <p>Oni was so angry that he almost vomited out a mouthful of blood. Immediately,
                                            he personally charged into the Peerless Battalion camp, heading straight for
                                            the command tent.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he charged into the large command tent, Oni saw the entire
                                            Peerless Battalion command structure, led by Hua Feng, seated there enjoying
                                            their breakfast. Two of the Main Company Leaders were still joking around,
                                            snatching food from each other… There was no sign of nervousness or fear
                                            that they were experiencing an attack from a powerful foe!?</p>
                                        <p>“What are you all doing? The alarms have already rang, the enemy is
                                            attacking, didn’t you all hear?!” Oni shouted angrily.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er lifted her head and swept Oni with a gold glare, before
                                            biting down on the apple in her hand.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the look in Shangguan Fei’er’s eyes, only then did Oni’s bluster fade
                                            slightly. He had experienced her terrifying strength for himself.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng smiled faintly and said: “Regiment Commander Oni, please do not be
                                            so anxious. Even if we have to fight in a war, we have to let our brothers
                                            have their fill first. I’m sure the entire Northwest Armies has enough men
                                            that our Peerless Battalion need not be the first to muster right?”</p>
                                        <p>“You…” Oni shouted angrily. Just as he was about to continue scolding, he saw
                                            the rest of the Peerless Battalion officers glare at him, a ferocious light
                                            in their eyes.</p>
                                        <p>As the saying goes, a wise man does not fight when the odds are against him.
                                            Oni was no fool, and he gave an angry humph and said: “Fine. Anyway, our
                                            Heavy Infantry Regiment’s orders is just to follow your lead and work with
                                            you. Since you all aren’t urgent, why should I be? I’ll eat as well!”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, under the gaping stares of the Peerless Battalion officers,
                                            he moved forward bluntly, ignoring their stares as he grabbed three eggs
                                            with a single hand. With his other hand, he grabbed a large bowl of milk and
                                            started gulping it down.</p>
                                        <p><i>This fellow has never eaten before? </i>The Peerless Battalion officers
                                            held back their smiles as they watched Oni eat, but no one stopped him.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng said: “Vice Commander Wei, please get some of our brothers to send
                                            some food over to the Heavy Infantry Regiment. We are about to fight, and
                                            how can our allies fight well with us on an empty stomach!”</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng suppressed his laughter and said: “Yes Sir, I’ll arrange that right
                                            now.” As he said that, he strode out of the tent in wide strides. As he did
                                            so, his entire body was shaking up and down. <i>Too evil, these guys were
                                                just too evil! </i>He couldn’t help but think to himself.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, there had been a sudden major improvement in food for the
                                            Peerless Battalion ever since they had won the bet… Furthermore, all the
                                            chit chat of the Peerless Battalion soldiers to the Heavy Infantry soldiers…
                                            all of that was arranged by Hua Feng and the other sly rascals of the
                                            Heavenly Bow Unit. In just these few dozen days, the effect was indeed
                                            crystal clear. In fact, even some rumours about the Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers having some beauties sent over to deal with their physiological
                                            ‘needs’ once in awhile could also be heard. In any case, for almost the
                                            entire Heavy Infantry Regiment, as soon as the Peerless Battalion was
                                            mentioned, it was with a tone of envy and jealousy...</p>
                                        <p>Although Wei Feng did not know what the exact plans of Hua Feng and Mu En
                                            were, it was without a doubt that it would be extremely beneficial to the
                                            Peerless Battalion. The war was about to start, and the Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers would all have to enter the battlefield once more. However, more
                                            so, this was the first time they would be fighting in such a major war with
                                            more than a million on both sides! What role would the Peerless Battalion
                                            play? Would it be a major one? Wei Feng was not exactly sure as well, but he
                                            was confident in the fighting capabilities of the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Barrels of piping hot milk and baskets of warm bread were soon sent to the
                                            Heavy Infantry Regiment, along with Oni’s orders… a single word: “Eat.”</p>
                                        <p>When Oni asked the Peerless Battalion to send out the order along with the
                                            food, he was thinking to himself: <i>Dammit, might as well eat and enjoy it
                                                all, it’s all bought with our money!</i></p>
                                        <p>....</p>
                                        <p>Just as Oni was enjoying himself gorging away in the Peerless Battalion camp,
                                            the Heavy Infantry Regiment was also feasting away on their breakfast. At
                                            the same time, the orders from the Seventh Legion was already flying out all
                                            around.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji had already brought the Seventh Legion to defend against the WanShou
                                            Empire attacks. As the Legion Commander, he naturally led the charge onto
                                            the battlefield, and he was currently directing the main Regiments of the
                                            Seventh Legion in fighting the crazed onslaught of enemies. Right at this
                                            moment, with the most elite Regiment and the one with the strongest
                                            defensive capabilities, the Heavy Infantry Regiment, not appearing, Shen Ji
                                            was extremely furious. However, very quickly he remembered that his own
                                            Heavy Infantry Regiment was now under the command of the Peerless Battalion.
                                            With no other choice, he could only send an order to the Peerless Battalion
                                            and request that they join the battle urgently.</p>
                                        <p>If it were any other Battalion or Regiment, Shen Ji would have lost his
                                            temper by now. Alas, he knew he could not do anything about the Peerless
                                            Battalion. Their strength aside, just their background of the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace was not one he could trifle with.</p>
                                        <p>The war had started, and the Northwest Army Camp was under an unprecedented
                                            stress. Not only was the WanShou Empire army at an hitherto unknown number,
                                            the sheer pressure they had on the spirit was massive, especially with the
                                            tactics they had been using. The ZhongTian army soldiers had not had any
                                            proper rest for several days, how could they possibly defend against the
                                            WanShou Empire soldiers in their top condition? Only with their traps and
                                            fortifications along with their sheer numbers allowed them to barely hold
                                            back the enemy invasion. However, the sheer amount of injuries and death
                                            continued rising.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Soon, breakfast was finished, and the Peerless Battalion finally gave the
                                            order to gather. Hua Feng looked to Oni, who had a satiated look on his
                                            face, before saying: “Regiment Commander Oni, everything as per our normal
                                            training. Your men do not have to be on the offensive at all, you just need
                                            to protect my men, and that will be sufficient.”</p>
                                        <p>Oni eyed Hua Feng, muttering to himself inwardly: <i>Your Peerless Battalion
                                            soldiers are already entirely dressed in titanium armour, are they even
                                            really afraid of the WanShou Empire arrows?</i></p>
                                        <p>Although he was thinking that in his heart, his face was impassive and did
                                            not show anything as he spoke: “Very well, we will definitely protect our
                                            good allies, and this breakfast we ate will not be for nothing. However, if
                                            the command were to blame us for not being on time, Battalion Commander Hua
                                            Feng please put in a good word for me.”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng laughed heartily and took a drink of water from his cup gracefully,
                                            before finally saying: “Regiment Commander Oni, please do not worry. We are
                                            all a family, if there are any responsibilities or blame, we will naturally
                                            share it all.”</p>
                                        <p>Although they were already late, the Peerless Battalion gathered swiftly.
                                            Before long, the five thousand Peerless Battalion soldiers had already
                                            gathered together with the Heavy Infantry Regiment along with their usual
                                            formation they had during training, and they advanced towards the defensive
                                            fortifications of the Northwest Army.</p>
                                        <p>The fortifications of the camp were situated about ten li from the actual
                                            encampment. The reason why they were set at such a distance was because it
                                            would allow themselves sufficient room for maneuvering in their formations.
                                            On the battlefield, positioning and formations were of utmost importance.
                                            Even though the WanShou Empire cavalry were extremely powerful, they would
                                            not easily charge towards a heavily fortified heavy infantry squad in proper
                                            formation, as that would affect their capabilities in combat, especially
                                            their main advantage of speed and momentum.</p>
                                        <p>The movement speed of the Heavy Infantry soldiers was not fast, but ten li
                                            wasn’t too far. As they neared the battlefield, the sounds of fighting,
                                            killing and clash of metal was deafening.</p>
                                        <p>However, for both the Heavy Infantry Regiment soldiers or the Peerless
                                            Battalion soldiers, none of them were surprised or shocked by the sight in
                                            front of them. After all, they were not newbies on the battlefield, and they
                                            had experienced the brutal realities of war many times before. As elite
                                            soldiers, the warriors were filled with excitement for their own upcoming
                                            fight with their foes.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng did not arrange for the Gold Crow Tribe and Berserker Tribe warriors
                                            to join this particular fight. The reason was simple - their equipment was
                                            not complete yet. With the Heavy Infantry Regiment as cover for the Peerless
                                            Battalion, their presence would not be as sorely missed for this battle.</p>
                                        <p>“Prepare for battle!” Hua Feng gave the order, and the Heavy Infantry
                                            soldiers around realised that as soon as the Peerless Battalion soldiers
                                            heard Hua Feng’s order, their aura and presence changed instantly.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander Hua Feng, shouldn’t we report to the higher command
                                            first? We need to get our assignments from them!” Oni saw that Hua Feng was
                                            about to let the Peerless Battalion join the battle directly, and was
                                            extremely surprised.</p>
                                        <p>Armies had their own rules, and the most important thing on the battlefield
                                            was undoubtedly to obey orders. Under the command of high ranking officers,
                                            they had to work together with the orders to bring about their greatest
                                            strength together. Once orders were disobeyed on the battlefield, the
                                            consequences could be dire… and punishment would also be severe.</p>
