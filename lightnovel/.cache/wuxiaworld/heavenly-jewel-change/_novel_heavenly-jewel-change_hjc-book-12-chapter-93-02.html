                                            surrounding them, and to provide some measure of heat for his companions.
                                            Every thousand metres or so they climbed meant about a six degree drop in
                                            temperature, but with Xiao Yan’s help and the strong physiques as Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters, it was not a huge problem. They had heard that the pillars
                                            extended more than five thousand metres high, but they did not know the
                                            exact height. Since it was their first time climbing it, they wanted to be
                                            as careful as possible.</p>
                                        <p>Slowly, the mist surrounding them grew thinner. After another hour of
                                            climbing, the sight before them changed almost abruptly, as they had broken
                                            past the bank of clouds and could actually see them below!</p>
                                        <p>An amazing sight filled the eyes of the Fei Li Battle Team members. They
                                            could clearly see the skies right in front of them, a clear brilliant
                                            beautiful blue, the almost piercing sunlight, and at their feet was a huge
                                            mass of clouds that seemed almost impenetrable. Such a vision, it was as if
                                            they had wandered into another realm altogether, causing a strange feeling
                                            in their hearts.</p>
                                        <p>This was, however, not the end of the road. Right above their heads, about
                                            two thousand metres away estimatedly, loomed the massive presence of the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island. They could also see the other fifteen pillars
                                            supporting the huge island, painting a breathtaking picture before their
                                            eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Heavenly Jewel Island. This was the Heavenly Jewel Island of legend!</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch muttered to herself: “For the Heavenly Jewel Island to be called
                                            the greatest miracle of the entire mainland… It truly deserves its name.
                                            This is like a saintly paradise amongst the mortal world!”</p>
                                        <p>She was not the only one who felt that way. This was also the first time
                                            seeing such a sight for each and every one of the Fei Li Battle Team
                                            members, and that sight sparked an awe and excitement in their hearts that
                                            couldn’t be expressed in words alone. Not even mentioning what they could
                                            possibly gain materially on this Heavenly Jewel Island, just the sheer view
                                            and majesty of this miraculous island was enough to shock their hearts and
                                            satisfy them.</p>
                                        <p>The size of the Heavenly Jewel Island itself was large, but not overly
                                            massive, at least in comparison to the sixteen pillars supporting it.
                                            Looking at it from the distance, they estimated jt was about the size of the
                                            ZhongTian City. From their view, the bottom of the island was entire pitch
                                            black, but as for what was on top, they would only be able to find out when
                                            they reached their destination.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing sucked in a deep breath, saying: “Wow indeed. But what happens
                                            if the Heavenly Jewel Island falls to the ground one day, wouldn’t it
                                            totally destroy the ZhongTian City below?”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo gave him a silencing gesture, saying: “Do not speak of that, not
                                            even as a joke. We are almost reaching the top, and I must warn all of you.
                                            When we reach the actual Heavenly Jewel Island, you all have to watch your
                                            words. This is the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and there are power houses
                                            galore here. Safety first is of the utmost importance, and you should not
                                            cause any trouble. When there is nothing on, I want everyone to stick
                                            together as a group.”</p>
                                        <p>All of them nodded in agreement, and finally Lin TianAo continued up, leading
                                            the way, satisfied.</p>
                                        <p>At this height, the temperature was naturally even lower. However, without
                                            the clouds blocking their vision, they were actually able to move at a much
                                            faster pace. They could see that the other three Battle Teams had already
                                            almost reached the Heavenly Jewel Island, and since it was relatively safer
                                            now, they decided to accelerate their pace as well.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, after slightly under an hour, they reached the five thousand metre
                                            high Heavenly Jewel Island. After another check of their Heavenly Jewel
                                            Plaques, they went through a round of registration before entering the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island.</p>
                                        <p>The other three Battle Teams had long since reached, and many of them looked
                                            on impatiently while they waited for the Fei Li Battle Team to reach.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin said: “Alright, now that all of you are here, you can go
                                            ahead to take a break and have a good rest. The actual finals fight will
                                            begin three days later. In this three days, you can move about freely the
                                            island as you wish. However, be warned that there are some areas that are
                                            restricted, and if you are stopped, do not try to enter forcibly, otherwise
                                            you will be treated as a hostile invader. If you need anything or have any
                                            queries about the Heavenly Jewel Island, you can ask any of the employees
                                            here, and there will be someone assigned to bring all of you to your
                                            respective accommodations.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, Shangguan Longyin seemed to meld into the air,
                                            disappearing in a flash.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, the members of the Fei Li Battle Team had heard Shangguan
                                            Longyin’s words clearly. However, they did not rush off into things, instead
                                            taking the time to take in the entirety of the sights and sounds of this new
                                            environment they were in.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as they had entered the Heavenly Jewel Island, they realised that
                                            they no longer felt the biting cold that had been prevalent on their way up.
                                            Even the humidity level [1. At least I think that’s what he was trying to
                                            write. He used 混度 (hun du) which doesn’t exactly have a direct translation,
                                            the closest I can think of could be 湿度 (shi du) which looks similar, and
                                            means humidity. Another possible meaning is 混, which is how clear the vision
                                            was, but he already mentioned how clear the air was after going through the
                                            cloud layer. I’m thus left with the humidity level, though it doesn’t make
                                            full sense to me in the context of the sentence. I’m open to suggestions.]
                                            was actually higher than when they were climbing the pillars, being only
                                            slightly lower than ground level.</p>
                                        <p>The surrounding area was full of grass and greenery, with many different
                                            types of plants flourishing. In the distance, there were several peaks
                                            forming a mountain range series, dotting the landscape. If not for the fact
                                            that they had just climbed up the rock pillars to reach this place, and
                                            could still it behind them, they could hardly belief that this was five
                                            thousand metres up in the sky!</p>
                                        <p>As compared to the Fei Li Battle Team’s surprise and curiosity, the other
                                            three Battle Teams were much better. After all, many of them had actually
                                            been here before.</p>
                                        <p>The four assigned employees went to their respective Battle Teams to bring
                                            them to their accommodations, though strangely they did not head in the same
                                            direction, instead splitting up soon after. Clearly, their accommodations
                                            were all separate.</p>
                                        <p>The white clad guide leading the Fei Li Battle Team looked to be about thirty
                                            years old of age, and Zhou Weiqing sidled up closer to him as they walked,
                                            asking curiously: “This Big Brother, for all of us, this is our first time
                                            on the Heavenly Jewel Island. Could you please introduce the entire island
                                            briefly to us?”</p>
                                        <p>The white clad man smiled faintly, saying: “Of course I can. First of all,
                                            congratulations to you all for entering the top four. It has been many
                                            decades since a non seeded team has actually accomplished that. Alas, I was
                                            on duty during that period on the Island and wasn’t able to watch all the
                                            matches.”</p>
                                        <p>“As for our Heavenly Jewel Island, there are actually three places which are
                                            the most famous. The Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the Consolidating Equipment
                                            Pavilion, and the Skill Storing Palace. The Heaven’s Expanse Palace is
                                            usually not open to the public, and is considered sacred ground in our
                                            entire Island. As such, most of the guests on the Island will visit the
                                            Consolidating Equipment Pavilion and the Skill Storing Palace; it can be
                                            said that both our Consolidating Equipment Pavilion and the Skill Storing
                                            Palace are considered top notch in the entire continent, literally
                                            unmatched. Later, when we reach your accommodations, you will see that it is
                                            not far from those two famed areas, as it is all in the central zone of the
                                            Island. For all of you, the central zone of the Island is the only place
                                            open for access, and the other zones, especially the Wild Zone on the
                                            outside, are not to be accessed or you will be treated as hostile
                                            invaders.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing their guide’s simple introduction, Zhou Weiqing had a rough picture
                                            of the entire Heavenly Jewel Island. Without question, the Wild Zone that
                                            was restricted to them definitely held many secrets. Perhaps the thirteen
                                            dragon caves or even other plant, animal treasures or rare ores could be
                                            found there. Of course, this Heavenly Jewel Island was the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace’s, the heart of the ZhongTian Empire, and no one would mess around
                                            here for nothing.</p>
                                        <p>As they walked deeper into the Island, the air became fresher, wetter, more
                                            comfortable; full of the faint fragrance of plants. Combined with the pure,
                                            soft rays of the sunshine bathing upon them, it was just like Little Witch
                                            had described previously -</p>
                                        <p>Within the entire Fei Li Battle Team, the one who was the most intoxicated by
                                            the scene, almost deep in a reverie, was Little Witch. That was because she
                                            had the Life Attribute, and immersed in such a natural environment, she had
                                            a deep, profound sensation.</p>
                                        <p>Led by the employee, they travelled almost for fifteen minutes before they
                                            reached the central zone that he had mentioned.</p>
                                        <p>It was almost like a little ‘City’ in its own right, just without any city
                                            gates. After all, it was on the Heavenly Jewel Island, what need was there
                                            of tall walls and gates.</p>
                                        <p>Along the broad lanes were shops lined on either side, and all the
                                            shopkeepers were dressed similarly to their guide. However, those shops were
                                            actually nothing to do with Heavenly Jewel Masters, either selling food,
                                            clothing or some necessities.</p>
                                        <p>As per their guide’s introduction, the Fei Li Battle Team members realised
                                            that all those shops were actually not selling ordinary food or clothing,
                                            but actually rare treasures. For example, the food could be exotic Heavenly
                                            Beasts and/or rare plants, while the clothes were also made out of precious
                                            materials and unique handicraft. There were also specialised inns for those
                                            guests with the Heavenly Jewel Plaque. Of course, all those things were
                                            extremely expensive indeed.</p>
                                        <p>According to their guide, even the cheapest inn would cost more than a
                                            thousand gold coins per night, and that wasn’t inclusive of meals. Of
                                            course, this time, as they were attending the Heavenly Jewel Tournament,
                                            their accommodations would be free, but that would only be during the period
                                            of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Heavenly Jewel Island, it was forbidden for anyone to spend the
                                            night in the streets, and they had to find some kind of accommodation, be it
                                            inns, hotels or whatnot. As such, if someone wanted to stay here for a long
                                            period of time to cultivate and make full use of their Skill Storing Palace
                                            and Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, they would have to prepare a colossal
                                            amount of gold coins first. This was one way for the Heavenly Jewel Island
                                            to restrict or limit their guests, at the same time a great way to profit
                                            greatly.</p>
                                        <p>Very quickly, the members saw the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion and Skill
                                            Storing Palace in their sights, situated at the side of the zone, not far
                                            from each other. As for the other side of the central zone, it was covered
                                            with a cloudy mist, giving zero visibility. Clearly, that was the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace, and they had some sort of unknown seal or protection which
                                            made use of the mist to hide themselves.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to the ZhongTian City’s Skill Storing Palace and Consolidating
                                            Equipment Pavilion, the size of the ones on the Heavenly Jewel Island was
                                            much smaller, only about the size of the one that Zhou Weiqing had been to
                                            in the Flying Hill City. However, without a doubt, it was likely they were
                                            going for quality over quantity here.</p>
                                        <p>The Fei Li Battle Team was housed in a nameless inn on the side, not far from
                                            the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion and Skill Storing Palace. It wasn’t
                                            particularly luxurious or grand, but was clean and neat. Even staying at
                                            such an inn alone cost at least a thousand gold coins per person per day,
                                            and that wasn’t even with individual rooms. The price was definitely
                                            insane.</p>
                                        <p>Before the guide left, he told them that during the period of the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Tournament, their stay would be free, but it would not include their
                                            meals. As for what they wanted to eat, that would be up to them to handle
                                            themselves.</p>
                                        <p>As per usual, they gathered in Lin TianAo’s room. It had been early morning
                                            when they had set out from the ZhongTian City, and by now it was already in
                                            the afternoon, and they had to face the problem of lunch.</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao couldn’t help but say: “Luckily we all won quite some money,
                                            otherwise we would have to starve all the way through this tournament.
                                            Earlier, when we were walking, I took a look at their prices and they were
                                            indeed terrifying.”</p>
                                        <p>For Ye Paopao, a son of the Premier of the Fei Li Empire, to say that the
                                            food was expensive, and terrifyingly so, one could just imagine the sheer
                                            prices.</p>
                                        <p>Drunken Bao patted Zhou Weiqing on the shoulder and grinned wickedly, saying:
                                            “No problem, we have our rich man here to treat us!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at him exasperatedly and said: “No way, I’m not treating
                                            you guys anymore.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
