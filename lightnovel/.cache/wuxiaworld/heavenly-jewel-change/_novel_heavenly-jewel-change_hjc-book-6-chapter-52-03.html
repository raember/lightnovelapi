                                            the first! Although he was a Heavenly Jewel Master, he was of common birth,
                                            and what he hated most was for his freedom to be restricted. As such, he had
                                            always depended on himself throughout his life in cultivating. He had worked
                                            hard and finally saved enough to Store the Stoneskin Skill on his first
                                            Elemental Jewel, but that had wiped out all his savings. Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls were just too expensive, and he just could not afford
                                            them. Yet, Zhou Weiqing was willing to provide them with them as long as he
                                            was boss in school, and without requiring them to be Sealed or restricting
                                            them! This was just an opportunity that only came by once in a blue moon,
                                            yet he had not seized that opportunity, and perhaps even offended him. He
                                            was even worried that his future possible equipment might be in peril.</p>
                                        <p>Just as the crowd were staring at Zhou Weiqing excitedly and fanatically, the
                                            classroom door opened. Ming Hua entered carrying a large stack of
                                            papers.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to the seductive look she had on yesterday, Ming Hua had a
                                            serious and even cold look on right now. When she spotted Zhou Weiqing, her
                                            body shuddered slightly, but she continued on towards the podium at the
                                            front of the class.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s face turned serious and he turned to the other students and
                                            said: “Classmates, class has started, let’s all go back to our seats. Do not
                                            worry, I will handle each and every one of your requests, it will not take a
                                            long time.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, he walked towards Ming Hua, seeming the perfect image of a
                                            class monitor, as he took the stack of papers from Ming Hua.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, he was barely a foot from Ming Hua, and his mouth twitched as
                                            he said in a low voice that only the two of them could hear: “Little Wife
                                            Teacher, how are you!”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua froze instantly, and she glared at Zhou Weiqing. At that moment, she
                                            felt anger welling out in her again, and the instructions from her father
                                            last night vanished from her mind, and her usual calm also disappeared as
                                            she glared at him viciously, saying through gritted teeth: “If you talk more
                                            rubbish, I’ll pit my life to kill you.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not expect her to have such a huge reaction, and he grinned
                                            but did not say anything else, placing the stack of papers on the podium and
                                            turning back and was about to return to his seat.</p>
                                        <p>“Stop. Monitor, give out the papers, one set per person. We are having a
                                            test.”</p>
                                        <p>“Test?” Zhou Weiqing stared dumbfounded at Ming Hua, muttering to himself:
                                            “Could it be a test on military matters?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua said coldly: “We are a military academy, what else can we be testing
                                            on?” Every year when class starts, we always test the freshmen first. We
                                            need to know your current standard of knowledge before we can design a
                                            proper teaching plan. You have entered our academy, and you don’t even know
                                            this most basic thing?” Seeing Zhou Weiqing’s frozen expression from her
                                            words, she felt a sudden rush of happiness. After all, it wasn’t easy to get
                                            one over this fellow with words.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s face twitched a little, and he thought to himself. <i>Damn, I
                                            just managed to earn my status in class, if I get the lowest score in class,
                                            how can I keep my position as monitor! </i>Looking at Ming Hua, he thought
                                            for the first time that perhaps it would be good to get on her good side as
                                            well. Smiling, he said: “Beautiful teacher, as the monitor, I think I should
                                            help you reduce your workload. How about, I help you invigilate this test?”
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua gave a humph and said: “Stop talking rubbish and give out the
                                            papers.” As she said that, she took her seat behind the podium, ignoring
                                            Zhou Weiqing. The anger within her had vanished by now, and seeing the
                                            gloomy expression on his face, she knew she had caught his weak spot. <i>Hmph,
                                                you called me little wife teacher earlier, and now you’re trying to
                                                change to beautiful teacher?! Let’s wait and see!</i></p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing could only give out the papers helplessly before returning to
                                            his own seat.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua said sternly: “Alright, now everyone has the test in hand. Today is
                                            the first day of school, and in schedule this is a class meeting. Now,
                                            everyone just answer your papers by yourself; this is to test your overall
                                            military knowledge, and I hope all of you take this seriously. I will be
                                            taking down the scores of all of you, and the lowest two will be in charge
                                            of cleaning the classroom for a week. That includes the toilet beside the
                                            classroom! Alright, enough said, let us begin. If anyone dares cheat, you’ll
                                            get a zero directly. And if there are many zeroes, I will extend the
                                            cleaning duties beyond a week.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing there was a test, Zhou Weiqing was not the only one who was worried.
                                            Speaking of which, the one sitting right beside him at the back row, the
                                            large Ma Qun, also had a strange worried look on his face, his brow
                                            twitching.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss Zhou.” Ma Qun sidled closer to Zhou Weiqing and said softly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was currently rather gloomy, and said rather bad temperedly:
                                            “What?”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun gulped, saying nervously: “Boss Zhou, in the future, I’ll treat you as
                                            my boss okay. This time I am serious, and I will never go back on my word.
                                            Can you help me get through this test?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started. “Haven’t you learnt any military knowledge?”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun’s head drooped down. “In the past, I did attend a military high
                                            school, but in classes I was either trying to score with the girls or just
                                            sleeping. How could I possibly know how to answer these tests! I only got
                                            into this academy because I am a Heavenly Jewel Master, and I didn’t even
                                            take the military knowledge test.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked and him seriously and said: “I’m sorry, I really can’t
                                            accept you as a follower as I can’t help you. Damn, if you don’t know how to
                                            do it, do you think I will? At least you’ve been to a military high school,
                                            I haven't even had that luxury.”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun stared at him, his eyes wide. “What?! Boss, you…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing furrowed his brow and said: “I’m not all-knowing. It’s up to
                                            yourself.” As he said that, he noticed Shangguan Bing'er, who was seated at
                                            the front, look at him, worry for him displayed on her face.</p>
                                        <p>Even if he couldn't make it for the test, he didn’t want to lose face. Zhou
                                            Weiqing immediately gave her a reassuring confident smile, not showing his
                                            own worry.</p>
                                        <p>“The test has started, if you all continue chit chatting, you’ll get a zero.”
                                            Ming Hua stood up from behind the podium, walking over. Currently, she
                                            looked every bit the stern teacher, a fierce light in her eyes as she looked
                                            across the class, and every student felt as if she were looking at them.</p>
                                        <p>A test… so be it. Zhou Weiqing grabbed a pen from the desk and started
                                            writing helplessly. Although he did not have any professional knowledge, he
                                            could still write as he pleased. Looking at the questions, he started
                                            writing quickly, answering the questions with the best answers he could
                                            think off. The way he wrote so quickly, anyone would think he was a skilled
                                            scholar.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua had been walking down towards Zhou Weiqing, hoping to look at him
                                            fail. However, seeing the way he was writing away, confident and quick,
                                            without any hint of wanting to copy from others, she started a little.</p>
                                        <p>After all, from her experiences with Zhou Weiqing, he had just created too
                                            many miracles. Who knows whether this fellow had some other hidden talents
                                            or abilities she did not know about. Perhaps he was even well versed in
                                            military knowledge… that was totally possible. After all, he had been
                                            praised by her brother, who was usually too proud to do so.</p>
                                        <p>There were eight pages to the exam, and the test took the entire morning. The
                                            more Zhou Weiqing wrote, the more confident he felt. Although he had not
                                            officially studied any military knowledge, he had after all spent two years
                                            in the Heavenly Bow Unit, and had developed his own way of dealing with
                                            things. The way he wrote, without any hesitation, caused Ma Qun beside him
                                            to stare in amazement. When Zhou Weiqing had first started, Ma Qun thought
                                            that he had lied to him, but with his height advantage, he was able to sneak
                                            a peek on Zhou Weiqing’s paper, and in doing so, he was even more
                                            confused.</p>
                                        <p><i>This Boss Zhou was indeed impressive, he totally did not know military
                                            knowledge, yet he was still writing with such enthusiasm. What did I just
                                            see? He wrote that in military exercises, he would give a few beauties to
                                            the opposing commander the night before, causing him to be overly exhausted
                                            and not be able to concentrate.</i> What sort of tactics was that? Ma Qun
                                            was speechless… he could only bow down to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>In the end, Ming Hua still ended up standing next to Zhou Weiqing, putting up
                                            a look of a serious and fierce examiner, but her eyes were glued to Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s paper.</p>
                                        <p>When she first looked at Zhou Weiqing’s answers, she almost burst out
                                            laughing. What was this rascal writing?! Even the easiest of the military
                                            knowledge questions, the answers he had written were donkey's lips that
                                            could not fit into a horse's mouth[1. Direct Translation of the idiom
                                            驴唇不对马嘴. Basically means rather inappropriate answers.]. Yet he seemed to be
                                            writing with such enthusiasm and ease, with such a look as if he were a top
                                            scoring scholar.</p>
                                        <p>However, the more she read, the smile in her eyes slowly vanished, replaced
                                            by a grave look.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, Zhou Weiqing did not know anything about these basic military
                                            knowledge, in fact it was almost to a point where he didn’t know many of the
                                            definitions of the military phrases. However, when it came to analysis of
                                            battles and simulations of battles, it was just unbelievably stunning.</p>
                                        <p>No matter her father or her brother, they were famed generals in the Fei Li
                                            Empire. Naturally, she had spent a lot of time immersed in the military
                                            world, and was highly influenced by what she had experienced. In fact, Ming
                                            Hua’s talent and achievements in the military world were extremely high.
                                            However, it was just too difficult for a female in the military world, and
                                            her brother’s achievements were already extremely high, added to the Fei Li
                                            Empire rules about families, she did not go further into a military career.
                                            Even so, she had a much better and discriminating eye as compared to many of
                                            the professional teachers in the academy. In fact, before she became a
                                            teacher, during her time in the academy, she was a top student, the
                                            valedictorian of her cohort, with her results even surpassing that of her
                                            brother. That was also why she had been asked to stay as a teacher by the
                                            Academy.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua found that Zhou Weiqing was a novice in terms of military knowledge,
                                            but his grasp on strategy, tactics and especially the big picture vision was
                                            extremely strong. The few large questions on battle analysis, tactics and
                                            battle simulations, he had always gotten to the heart of the matter easily,
                                            quickly finding the root issue, and his solutions were always unique and
                                            unrestrained. In the military world, her brother was known to be a rather
                                            wild and crazy person; but in comparison with Zhou Weiqing’s answers, he
                                            would be rather tame.</p>
