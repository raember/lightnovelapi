                                            of all of those Commanders, not a single one had even come close to being
                                            like Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Although these Ruffian Battalion soldiers were arrogant ruffians, none of
                                            them had ever dared to actually attack fellow soldiers on duty. After all,
                                            the entire northern army was the elite of the Empire. As part of the Ruffian
                                            Battalion, they were already considered criminals. If they further angered
                                            the army head, it might actually bring death to them. After all, before
                                            being sent to the Ruffian Battalion, their names were already removed from
                                            the roster of the normal army.</p>
                                        <p>That massive brawny soldier who was built like a black tower jumped down from
                                            the perch he was on, shouldering his spiked club as he walked towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing. “Zhou Little Fatty right? Don’t you know that by doing what you
                                            just did, you are just going to get us all killed? Since these personal
                                            guards are from the Sixteenth Regiment, even if we mugged them for all their
                                            gear, do you think that the Sixteenth Regiment won’t sent more to get them
                                            back? We are isolated here, and even if we were all killed off, no one would
                                            know… or care.”</p>
                                        <p>The rest of the Ruffian Battalion soldiers also came closer behind the brawny
                                            soldier, surrounding Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er in a tight
                                            circle.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing swept his gaze across all of them, a disdainful look in his
                                            eyes. “No wonder all these years you all can only stay here, living a life
                                            without proper shelter, clothes and food. Hmph, and you still call yourself
                                            the Ruffian Battalion… with such a pathetic courage, how can you call
                                            yourself ruffians?”</p>
                                        <p>“Little brat, are you asking to die?!” The black brawny soldier yelled
                                            angrily, grabbing the spiked club and lifting it up.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, the Ruffian Battalion soldiers were greatly surprised
                                            by what happened next.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged his body in a single motion, and stripped the armour
                                            off his body, throwing his helmet to the side, along with bracers and
                                            greaves.</p>
                                        <p>Soon after, his army uniform top followed, and Zhou Weiqing was soon in the
                                            same state as the black brawny fellow, with his top naked.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of size, even Zhou Weiqing was smaller than the massive soldier, but
                                            his muscles were well defined and well lined in their own right.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er gave a light humph, turning around, though her face hidden
                                            behind the mask was blushing slightly.</p>
                                        <p>“What are you doing? Are you trying to sell your body? Although we are all
                                            exiled here, we do not have any interest in men.” The black brawny fellow
                                            said coldly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, saying: “From your words earlier, you all should
                                            be afraid of death right? That’s fine, as long as we are human, we would all
                                            be afraid of death. I’m no different, I’m especially afraid of dying.
                                            However, the way I see it is that there is no point to talking to you all,
                                            no words can compare to action. Since you are afraid of revenge from the
                                            Sixteenth Regiment, let me tell you now, from this moment on, if you do not
                                            obey my commands, just myself alone, I can make the entire Ruffian Battalion
                                            vanish from this world.”</p>
                                        <p>“Hahahahaha.” The black brawny fellow burst out laughing heartily. “Do you
                                            really think that just because you knocked out twenty guards, that you can
                                            act like that in our Ruffian Battalion? Make us vanish from this world?
                                            Aren’t you afraid of spraining your tongue by bragging too much?
                                            Hahaha.”</p>
                                        <p>The black brawny fellow’s powerful voice suddenly stopped, as he was shocked
                                            to see Zhou Weiqing’s eyes abruptly turn red. Fresh Blood. Blood Red.</p>
                                        <p>An incomparable violent aura burst forth from Zhou Weiqing, and his muscles
                                            expanded abruptly as the black tiger tattoos appeared like flowing water
                                            around his body. If one were to liken the aura of the Ruffian Battalion
                                            soldiers to be violent, then Zhou Weiqing’s current aura was bloodthirsty,
                                            full of killing intent.</p>
                                        <p>*Swoosh* Without warning, Zhou Weiqing’s right leg lifted up in a sudden
                                            motion, and everyone could see the changes in his leg. The next moment, his
                                            right leg smashed down like an axe, striking the ground savagely.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er understood Zhou Weiqing’s strength, and she quickly jumped
                                            back a metre.</p>
                                        <p>*BOOOOM*</p>
                                        <p>It was as if the earth was struck by a ten thousand jin heavy hammer, and an
                                            earsplitting explosion ensued. Those closest to Zhou Weiqing felt as if
                                            their heads were dazed as an immense shockwave reverberated out from the
                                            ground, spreading out.</p>
                                        <p>A hundred men. All of them fell, just like a flower blooming in the summer as
                                            its petals spread, as they were knocked down by the shockwave. On the
                                            ground, crack after crack appeared, spreading outwards in a pattern like
                                            that of a turtle shell, reaching almost a hundred metres far and wide.</p>
                                        <p>The echo from the explosion continued for a while, as Zhou Weiqing’s large
                                            hand moved forward like a huge tiger’s paw. No one had seen him move
                                            clearly, and the black brawny fellow’s spiked club was already in Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s hand.</p>
                                        <p>Just like that, Zhou Weiqing raised the spiked club and smashed it downward
                                            on his own body. A screeching sound of metal clashing sounded out, and they
                                            were all shocked to see that the spike on his massive club actually broke
                                            off and almost disintegrated.</p>
                                        <p>Casually tossing the club downwards, there was a sickly thud, and the huge
                                            club actually vanished, leaving only a black hole in the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Let alone the Ruffian Battalion soldiers, even the twenty two warhorses were
                                            toppled off their feet by Zhou Weiqing’s blow on the ground, lying down on
                                            the ground shivering. Just that leg alone caused all of them to have looks
                                            of shock and disbelief on their faces.</p>
                                        <p>The evil looking blood orbs swept across all of them, finally resting again
                                            on the black soldier. “What is your name?”</p>
                                        <p>The black soldier swallowed hard. “Are you really human?”</p>
                                        <p>A flash before their eyes, and the next moment, his entire body had been
                                            lifted up by Zhou Weiqing above the ground. “I am the one asking the
                                            questions. What is your name?”</p>
                                        <p>“Everyone calls me Black Bear or Big Bear. My real name is Xiong Guangming
                                            [1. 熊光明 Xiong Guangming literally means Bear Bright Light].” Being a ruffian
                                            did not mean they were suicidal, and all of them were afraid of death as
                                            well, especially dying for no reason. More so when facing Zhou Weiqing in
                                            his Demonic Change State, which gave them all an overwhelming feeling like
                                            they could not resist against him. Under such a circumstance, it would be
                                            asking for death to be defiant.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and placed him back on the ground, saying: “Very good.
                                            Alright, no matter what you all plan to do against me, I’ll accept all
                                            challenges and comers. For now, obey my orders. Collect our spoils and lead
                                            me back to camp.”</p>
                                        <p>“All of you get up, are you all going to continue playing dead? Hurry up and
                                            listen to our Battalion Commander’s words.” Without hesitation, Big Bear
                                            gave the order, the look on his face had turned respectful. Going up against
                                            absolute strength for no reason was just being foolish, and he did not want
                                            to die. As for how much of that respect was real, that was not part of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s consideration. What he needed to do now was to solidify his
                                            position as their Battalion Commander first. As for how he would eventually
                                            bring the entire Battalion under control, he had many options to do so.
                                            After all, he had been taught by the God Eye Scoundrel! Ordinary army
                                            officers might not be able to handle the Ruffian Squadron, but he was
                                            confident it would not be a problem for him, as his own thinking and actions
                                            were often much closer in nature to these ruffians.</p>
                                        <p>In a matter of moments, the twenty personal guards from the Sixteenth
                                            Regiment were stripped of everything. Clothes, armour, weapons. Leading the
                                            horses by their reins, Big Bear and the hundred Ruffian Battalion soldiers
                                            gathered around Zhou Weiqing, and the entire troupe headed towards the camp
                                            in a mighty formation.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing dismissed the Demonic Change State, but he did not put his
                                            clothes back on. Just like that, bare-torsoed, he walked with Shangguan
                                            Fei’er to the head of the troupe.</p>
                                        <p>Xiong Guangming said: “Battalion Commander, you can go to my tent to rest
                                            first. It has been a long time since we had a Battalion Commander, so we do
                                            not have a specialised tent for one.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Alright, I’ll use your tent first. You should
                                            be one of the Company Leaders of our Battalion right? Go and gather all the
                                            other Company Leaders, and let them know what happened. As for any
                                            retaliation from the Sixteenth Regiment, I will deal with it, all of you
                                            need not worry. Since I am now the Ruffian Battalion Battalion Commander, I
                                            will deal with any problems that come. I have my reasons for daring to do
                                            something like that.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes, yes, Battalion Commander Zhou is wise indeed.” For a man of such
                                            stature like Xiong Guangming to have such a deferential and respectful look,
                                            it was almost amusing. However, this actually let Zhou Weiqing have a higher
                                            opinion of him. The reason was simple, Zhou Weiqing did not particularly
                                            like people who had the unbending character, who would rather break than
                                            bend. That was because normally such people would not live long. What he
                                            needed was an intelligent army, not an army who would only fight to the
                                            death foolishly.</p>
                                        <p>The camp was situated between some of the hills, not too far from where they
                                            were currently. At the same time, they could see how shabby the camp was,
                                            with many of the tents with holes. This was after all far up in the north,
                                            and the temperature was extremely cold. In the day, it wasn’t so bad,
                                            especially for those like Zhou Weiqing who had strong Heavenly Energy, and
                                            they could dismiss the weather. However, at night, the temperature would be
                                            even lower, and how could such tents block out the cold winds. That was
                                            probably the reason why they had set up their camp in the small valley of
                                            the hills, to help block out some of the biting wind.</p>
                                        <p>Xiong Guangming brought Zhou Weiqing to one of the relatively whole tents,
                                            inviting him in. The tent was only about ten square metres large, with about
                                            six or seven large patches. Still, in comparison, it was already extremely
                                            solid and tight. Even so, after entering the tent, they could still feel the
                                            wind entering from all around, though it had the unexpected benefit of
                                            having good ventilation and air within.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing furrowed his brow, then said to Xiong Guangming: “Go ahead then,
                                            gather all the Company Leaders and bring them here.”</p>
                                        <p>Xiong Guangming turned and exited the tent. The moment he did so, a cold
                                            light flashed in his eyes. Among the ten Company Leaders of the Ruffian
                                            Battalion, he was actually the lowest ranked in terms of power.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, having been beaten and threatened by Zhou Weiqing, he had no
                                            choice but to obey him temporarily. However, now that they were back in the
                                            Ruffian Battalion… hmph… a mere twenty year old kid wanted to command them?
                                            He must be daydreaming.</p>
                                        <p>At last, only Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er were left in the tent, and
                                            she looked at him exasperatedly before saying: “I can’t understand what you
                                            are doing, why must we come to this desolate and godforsaken place, where
                                            even the birds won’t deign to shit in [1. That latter part is the literal
                                            translation, an idiom meaning a desolate place.] What can we develop or grow
                                            here? If we don’t leave this place, you’ll be stuck here forever as a
                                            Battalion Commander.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Although this place is much shabbier
                                            and tattered than I had hoped for, it is still not a bad thing. You should
                                            understand that what I need and want is not an army that belongs to the
                                            ZhongTian Empire, but one that belongs to me alone. So what if it is the
                                            Ruffian Battalion? This is the place where I shall rise to power, you just
                                            wait and see.”</p>
