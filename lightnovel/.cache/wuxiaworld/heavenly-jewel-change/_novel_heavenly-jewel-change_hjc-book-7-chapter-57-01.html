                                            Scroll after Scroll.</p>
                                        <p>Only Qin Feng and Shangguan Bing’er noticed Zhou Weiqing’s second scroll’s
                                            completion, especially the vast disparity in speed between the first and
                                            second. Both of them started, their faces changing. Before they could react,
                                            another gold light flashed, and Zhou Weiqing’s third Consolidating Equipment
                                            was complete.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of being pleasing to the eye, Zhou Weiqing’s actions were definitely
                                            not comparable to Yun Li’s, which was smooth like flowing water. Instead,
                                            his was rather stiff and somewhat robotic. However, in terms of speed, he
                                            had shot way above Yun Li, completing an scroll seemed to be just going
                                            through the motions, without needing any gathering and focus of spirit. Not
                                            only did it greatly conserve his spirit, it also was unbelievably fast.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er's hands flew to her mouth, while Qin Feng’s eyes almost
                                            fell out of their sockets. At this time, he suddenly felt that the
                                            unbelievably arrogant words of Zhou Weiqing’s signs were not arrogant or
                                            exaggerated after all.</p>
                                        <p>The current Zhou Weiqing was like an assembly line, churning out
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. His face was expressionless, his eyes
                                            narrowed in concentration, and his hands were in a steady rhythm as sheet
                                            after sheet of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls were completed in his hands,
                                            the gold light signifying the completion constantly lighting up. The
                                            constant flash of gold light was just too frequent, and soon attracted the
                                            attention of some of the audience. As more gazes turned towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing, their eyes remained frozen upon him, even the boss of shop 76, Zhou
                                            Changxi.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li was currently deeply immersed in the creation of Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls, his entire body, mind and soul engrossed in the process
                                            as he grew more adept with each completion. As such, he was not aware of
                                            anything else around him. Before long, he had completed his twenty fifth
                                            scroll. In his heart, he was still thinking that he should start looking for
                                            other Consolidating Equipment Masters to compete in such a way. Under such
                                            stress and pressure, he could clearly feel that his technique was improving,
                                            in such a vast amount that normally was only accompanied by a huge amount of
                                            experience. Of course, even if he looked for others to compete with him, he
                                            wouldn’t place such a heavy bet.</p>
                                        <p>After completing his twenty fifth scroll and placing it at the side, Yun Li
                                            gave a small sigh of relief. In his mind, Zhou Weiqing should be much slower
                                            than him, and he did not feel any sense of urgency. Lifting up his head
                                            towards Zhou Changxi, he said: “Bro Zhou, could I get some water
                                            please?”</p>
                                        <p>Alas, when he lifted up his head, he immediately realised that the atmosphere
                                            around him was extremely weird. Furthermore, Zhou Changxi, who was standing
                                            close by, seemed to not even hear his words, his eyes transfixed on the
                                            opposite side. It wasn’t just Zhou Changxi, as everyone around was staring
                                            dumbfounded and dazed at the other side, many of them revealing looks of
                                            disbelief.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li’s heart sank suddenly, and he hurriedly turned to look as well. When
                                            he did so, he just happened to see a flash of gold light, and Zhou Weiqing
                                            placed a completed scroll at the side. Not only that, he clearly saw a stack
                                            of completed scrolls there, more than double what he himself had
                                            completed.</p>
                                        <p><i>This isn’t possible! </i>That was the first notion that appeared in his
                                            mind. He almost slammed the table and walked off, but he quickly stopped
                                            when he saw Zhou Weiqing creating his next scroll.</p>
                                        <p>It was a machine-like movement with seemingly nothing to praise, yet what
                                            made Yun Li’s jaw drop was the sheer speed of his movement. In barely the
                                            time it took to take ten breaths, another flash of gold light appeared
                                            around the Consolidating Paper once more, and yet another Scroll was
                                            completed.</p>
                                        <p>By this time, Yun Li did not even bother continuing creating his own Scrolls.
                                            Standing up suddenly, he strode towards Zhou Weiqing’s side. He could not
                                            believe his own eyes, could not believe that Zhou Weiqing’s speed could
                                            actually reach such an unbelievable pinnacle. Although they were only
                                            creating Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, Yun Li was sure that
                                            even Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Masters would not be able to create
                                            them at such speeds! This totally overturned all his knowledge about
                                            creating Consolidating Equipment scrolls… the knowledge and experience that
                                            he had immersed himself in for more than sixteen years!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s creation continued. This time, Yun Li saw it clearly. Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s motions were fast, but he still managed to intricately pause at
                                            the areas which required it. Although it did not have a smooth, flowing feel
                                            to it, the truth was that it was successful! Yet another scroll was
                                            completed.</p>
                                        <p>No matter how much he did not want to believe it, the truth was displayed in
                                            front of his eyes. Yun Li had already expended much of his spirit, and now
                                            he felt his brain go dizzy. He wished that he was dreaming, yet it was so
                                            clearly displayed before his very eyes. He suddenly thought that perhaps
                                            agreeing to this bet had been the worst decision of his life.</p>
                                        <p>This young man in front of him had a strange method of creating Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls, a method he had never even heard of before. If he had to
                                            describe it, there was only one word: Insane! [1. Once again, he used 变态
                                            with its many possible meanings. I just translated it into the closest
                                            possible context]</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s creation method naturally did not consume much spirit, and he
                                            knew that Yun Li had come to his side. In the middle of creating his next
                                            scroll, he was still able to look up and smile at him.</p>
                                        <p>Six Scrolls per minute, this was Zhou Weiqing’s absolute limit. From the time
                                            it took from the completion of the first scroll to the last scroll, he had
                                            taken less than half an hour.</p>
                                        <p>Putting down his brush, Zhou Weiqing noticed the deafening silence around.
                                            After packing up the completed scrolls and stacking them neatly, he looked
                                            up once more towards Yun Li and gave a confident smile. “Bro Yun Li, how is
                                            it? Have you already completed your set?”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li did not even return to his seat. After all, he had only finished 25
                                            Scrolls. At this moment, his face was deathly pale, looking at Zhou Weiqing
                                            with a strange expression on his face. His lips were tightly pursed, and his
                                            hands gripped tightly in fists. After a moment, he finally let loose a
                                            sigh.</p>
                                        <p>“I have lost. Although I do not know why or how exactly I have lost, I have
                                            to admit it. Can you please tell me how you did it? In my nearly twenty
                                            years in the Consolidating Equipment Master world, I have never seen or
                                            heard of anyone who can create Consolidating Equipment Scrolls at such a
                                            speed. That is already beyond the realms of common logic.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “I’m afraid that sometimes common logic
                                            isn’t always accurate. If I told you that this is an innate talent of mine,
                                            do you believe me?”</p>
                                        <p>Without hesitation, Yun Li said: “I believe you. Looks like I have
                                            underestimated the people of the world. I sincerely apologise for tearing
                                            your sign early. I admit that you truly have the potential to become a God
                                            Tier Consolidating Equipment Master in the future.”</p>
                                        <p>The moment Yun Li said that, there was an uproar in the surrounding crowd. By
                                            now, the audience had come to their senses from the shock, and their looks
                                            at Zhou Weiqing had all changed. Originally, there had been barely about
                                            twenty to thirty people watching the start of the competition, but the
                                            number had now grown to almost sixty! This was quite a huge number, after
                                            all the people who could enter the Trading Center were mostly Jewel Masters,
                                            each of whom had paid the membership dues! Under normal circumstances, it
                                            was nearly impossible for so many people to gather in front of a shop.
                                            However, none of them felt that this had been a waste of time. Not only had
                                            they witnessed an epic battle between two Consolidating Equipment Masters,
                                            the rare opportunity to actually see them at work, and even more so, they
                                            had witnessed the birth of a miracle!</p>
                                        <p>When the words ‘God Tier’ came out of Yun Li’s mouth, some of the younger
                                            Jewel Masters were eager and itching to sign up. If they could become a
                                            Follower of a future God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, that was an
                                            absolute honour. This would be the same in the entire Boundless Mainland, no
                                            matter where they were.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Yun Li’s words, Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Thank you
                                            Bro Yun Li, however, losing confidence is not a good sign just before a
                                            fight. Our bet is after all being a Lifetime Follower. Bro Yun Li, if you
                                            lose confidence now, you will have already lost half the battle.”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li took a deep breath, closing his eyes. When he opened them again, they
                                            were filled with an unprecedented fighting spirit. In a solemn voice, he
                                            said: “Before the final result is out, none of us can say who will win. Come
                                            on then, let’s see what your second competing topic is?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Very well, we can always exchange pointers
                                            after this duel is over. As for the second competition, it shall be our
                                            creation ability. Each of us shall take out a design that we believe is the
                                            toughest we have, and we will create each other’s design, and use that as a
                                            comparison. We do not have to succeed, but whoever is closest will win.”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li’s eyes narrowed and he said: “You want to fight based on our
                                            teachers?”</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing gave the topic, Yun Li had understood the underlying
                                            meaning. Every Consolidating Equipment Master had a few designs that they
                                            were unable to create yet, mostly from their teacher, school or clan, and it
                                            was usually what they were working towards as well. As such, when Yun Li
                                            mentioned competing teachers, it would mean comparing who had the higher
                                            quality design. The higher ranked and quality the design, the tougher it
                                            would be to complete, perhaps not even being able to create the
                                            Consolidating Ink. In that case, it would be an even higher chance of
                                            winning.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li drew a deep breath, a light shining in his eyes. Zhou Weiqing suddenly
                                            had a bad feeling, as he could see a massive confidence suddenly fill Yun
                                            Li’s eyes. <i>Hmmm… Could this fellow also have designs for a Legendary
                                                Set? </i>Zhou Weiqing thought to himself. If that were true, he could be
                                            in trouble! After all the third round would be Yun Li coming up with the
                                            topic! However, after a split second of panic, he calmed down once more.
                                            After all, even if they both had Legendary Set designs, as unlikely as it
                                            seemed, the worst case scenario would thus be a draw. If he then lost the
                                            3rd battle, the overall result would still end up as a draw.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing thought his way through that, Yun Li said solemnly:
                                            “What if we both aren’t able to even create the Consolidating Ink?”</p>
                                        <p></p>
