                                            that was happening before his eyes, especially when his subordinate clearly
                                            had the upper hand earlier. How did the situation change so suddenly? Even
                                            though the Tiger King looked like he was badly injured, his subordinate was
                                            directly killed off. </p>
                                        <p>It was to be noted that the Blood Red Hell had a shortage of powerhouses.
                                            After all, Zhou Weiqing had killed off quite a number of them earlier.
                                            Hence, the number of Heavenly Emperors he had was limited. The Blood Red
                                            Hell’s schemes were not only limited to this Grand Tournament. In fact, Fen
                                            Tian had already drawn up specific plans to deal with the other Saint Lands.
                                            However, just like that, he had lost one of his best Heavenly Emperors. Fen
                                            Tian could not hold back his gloominess. </p>
                                        <p> “What happened?” He had to clench his teeth as he asked his subordinate.</p>
                                        <p>The final collision in the sky was equivalent to a dramatic scene. Everyone
                                            else could clearly see that when the Blood Red Hell’s Heavenly Emperor’s
                                            black gigantic figure rammed into Xue AoYing’s body, the Tiger King, who
                                            originally looked pale and on the verge of death, suddenly released a
                                            piercing golden light from his body. </p>
                                        <p>The ray of golden light actually managed to forcefully rip open the extremely
                                            powerful Destructive Energy. With one blow, it created a big hole in the
                                            Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s body. The Tiger King had also suffered a
                                            heavy impact from the fallout of the Destructive Energy. Hence, both of them
                                            had fallen to the ground from above. </p>
                                        <p>Hearing the account given by his subordinates, Fen Tian was in disbelief. If
                                            the Destructive Energy was that easy to destroy, what was he going to rely
                                            on to lead the Dan Dun Empire into defeating the Geritimo Empire without
                                            much difficulty? Moreover he had made a grand appearance earlier on,
                                            preparing to use the Grand Tournament as a stepping stone to rule over the
                                            Mainland. </p>
                                        <p>Xue AoYing was clearly on the losing end earlier on, not forgetting the fact
                                            that he was already injured. Even if he was not injured and went all out
                                            without sparing any effort, it should not have been possible for him to
                                            destroy the Destructive Energy. The difference in their cultivation base was
                                            negligible and the power difference of their attributes was absolutely
                                            great. Any techniques he could have engaged in at that time should have been
                                            useless!</p>
                                        <p> “Fen Tian, I think that it must have been AoYing’s mistake. You have seen it
                                            too - when it comes to life and death, AoYing had to give his all as well. I
                                            would like to express my deepest regret with regards to your subordinate’s
                                            death.” Xue AoTian’s voice rang in Fen Tian’s ears. While the tone of his
                                            voice was truly apologetic, when Fen Tian turned to look at Xue AoTian, he
                                            could not see a trace of apology or regret on his face. </p>
                                        <p>Fen Tian subconsciously clenched his fist. He nearly flared up, but
                                            ultimately, he managed to hold in his anger. In any case, he was not morally
                                            right. After all, it was his subordinate who tried to deliver the fatal
                                            blow. Although he had not fully made out what happened, it was still not the
                                            time to fall out with the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>He forced out a smile, “The Tiger King is not to be blamed entirely. In the
                                            Grand Tournament, death can happen in just a blink of an eye. However, from
                                            the looks of it, the Tiger King is unable to continue fighting. In this
                                            battle, it could be considered that there are no winners. However, my
                                            subordinate had died. Hence, I had lost more in comparison. In that case, my
                                            man will join the battle line first, and you can send your second
                                            participant in after.”</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian nodded. Both Fen Tian and him sent out a participant each. Just
                                            like before, Fen Tian had sent out a Heavenly Emperor, but to everyone’s
                                            surprise, Xue AoTian sent out a Heavenly King instead.</p>
                                        <p>However, the leaders of the other Saint Lands were not taken by surprise
                                            pertaining to this arrangement. After all, the strongest individual in the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain was Xue AoTian himself. Their power on the whole was
                                            not too strong. Hence, it was inevitable for him to send in a Heavenly
                                            King. </p>
                                        <p>The mutual casualties of both the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Blood Red
                                            Hell had benefited the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. At least the Heavenly King,
                                            a cannon fodder, that they sent in for the first round was still able to
                                            allow the Heaven’s Expanse Palace to remain in the fourth place in the next
                                            cycle. Unfortunately, he was up against the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue
                                            next. </p>
                                        <p>A Heavenly Emperor against a Heavenly King. Unless he was an outlier like
                                            Zhou Weiqing, there was no suspense with regards to the end results. </p>
                                        <p>Wu Yunyue did not waste too much effort and energy. Just like that, he won
                                            the first round easily. </p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the first cycle of the first round of the Grand Tournament
                                            had ended. The winner of the first cycle was the Peerless Sect. Of course,
                                            in the eyes of Fen Tian, the Peerless Sect won only because of luck. If the
                                            Heavenly Emperor that he sent out did not die, Wu Yunyue might not have had
                                            it that easy.</p>
                                        <p>There were no breaks allowed during the Grand Tournament. Wu Yunyue’s next
                                            opponent was a participant from the Passion Valley. </p>
                                        <p>The second participant sent out by the Passion Valley was a Heavenly Emperor,
                                            just like before. He seemed somewhat nervous with Wu Yunyue as his opponent.
                                            When both parties soared to the sky, he clearly lagged behind Wu
                                            Yunyue. </p>
                                        <p>This was no wonder. Wu Yunyue was the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Demon Sect.
                                            Even though the Heavenly Demon Sect was the least powerful compared to the
                                            rest of the Great Saint Lands, but when it came down to individual power,
                                            nobody dared to take Wu Yunyue lightly due to his cultivation base. The Evil
                                            Attribute had a rather overbearing power. Moreover, it was coupled with the
                                            great Light and Darkness Attributes, as well as Life. Wu Yunyue’s power was
                                            great enough to win against Shangguan Tianyang who was equipped with the
                                            Boundless Infinitum Set. How could an ordinary Heavenly Emperor be able to
                                            win against him? Furthermore, in the previous match against the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace’s cannon fodder, Wu Yunyue barely consumed much energy.</p>
                                        <p>Following Wu Yunyue’s ascent to the sky, the entire sky became a shade of
                                            gray. The originally icy-cold air had became gloomy as well. Wu Yunyue’s
                                            face looked very calm but he had a ferocious look in his eyes.  </p>
                                        <p>He did not have a favorable impression of the other four Great Saint Lands.
                                            If not for their persecution, the Heavenly Demon Sect would not have needed
                                            to rely on someone else. He had volunteered to be the first participant of
                                            the Peerless Sect. He did not think about how long he needed to endure
                                            either - he merely needed a channel to release his burden. Without a doubt,
                                            the Demonic Emperor in such a state was extremely terrifying.</p>
                                        <p>Even though Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy could not help Wu Yunyue to
                                            successfully make a break through to the Heavenly God Stage, it managed to
                                            close the gap between his current cultivation base and the Heavenly God
                                            Stage. He was just one small step away. This was also because of the
                                            severity of Wu Yunyue’s old injury - part of the Saint Energy was used to
                                            treat his injuries as well. </p>
                                        <p>The Passion Valley’s Heavenly Emperor was facing Wu Yunyue from a distance in
                                            the sky. A distorted light allowed him to gain a foothold in the sky.
                                            However, compared to the omnipresent Evil Attribute of Wu Yunyue, he was
                                            clearly a lot weaker. The Passion Valley’s Heavenly Emperor was only at the
                                            Mid Level Heavenly Emperor Stage.</p>
                                        <p> “Demonic Emperor, after you.” Under the flickering light, while he was being
                                            equipped with eight pieces of a Legendary Set, the Passion Valley Heavenly
                                            Emperor gestured towards Wu Yunyue at the same time. </p>
                                        <p>Wu Yunyue did not even reply him - in an instant, he made his first move. A
                                            dense gray light erupted from within his body. At the same time, Wu Yunyue’s
                                            entire body began to swell up. Both his eyes instantly became blood red. His
                                            long hair had also turned into a horrifying shade of gray.</p>
                                        <p>Demonic Transformation. Indeed, the moment he ascended to the sky, he had
                                            used the Demonic Transformation. He did not even bother to test waters. </p>
                                        <p>Boom - an terrifying explosion sound resonated in the sky. Wu Yunyue charged
                                            towards the Passion Valley’s Heavenly Emperor like a cannon being shot out.
                                            The nine-piece Legendary Set covered his entire body, like gray crystals.
                                            Within his right hand, a long sword that was being condensed by gray
                                            crystals created a ray of light in the air, as it flashed across. </p>
                                        <p>The Demonic Emperor Set - even though this Legendary Set only had nine
                                            pieces, it was the Legendary Set that all the previous Demonic Emperors were
                                            equipped with. Amongst all the nine-piece Legendary Sets, it was the most
                                            powerful. </p>
                                        <p>Heavenly Jewel Masters with the Evil Attribute all believed in the Demon God.
                                            Amongst everyone present, Zhou Weiqing was the one who could sense all the
                                            abilities used by the Demonic Emperor the clearest. Wasn’t the gray sword in
                                            his hands an imitation of the Sword of the Demon God? </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing who was standing on the ground accidentally looked at Huang
                                            Xingyun of the Passion Valley. The moment he saw that Wu Yunyue had used the
                                            Demonic Transformation immediately, he clearly was stunned. Immediately
                                            after, he looked extremely worried.</p>
                                        <p>Rumble ——</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, a thunder-like sound was heard in the sky. At the Heavenly
                                            Emperor Stage, blows that were exchanged were a lot more direct. One must at
                                            least possess skills of the same level as the Heavenly Skill Image in order
                                            to have any effect. However skills at that level were not easy to use.
                                            Hence, in general, Heavenly Emperors were fighting with brute force. It was
                                            purely based on power and attributes, as well as combat experience and
                                            special techniques.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Emperor of the Passion Valley also seemed to use his full force
                                            to attack. Similarly, he had a sword in his hand. Taken by shock, he raised
                                            his sword as well.</p>
                                        <p>The distorted Time Attribute had caused the light rays around his body to
                                            show traces of disorder - one was to confuse the Demonic Emperor, the other
                                            was to use Time Disorder Skill to throw the Demonic Emperor off with regards
                                            to his attack. </p>
                                        <p>Unfortunately, his cultivation base was a far cry from that of Wu Yunyue’s.
                                            Moreover, after using the Demonic Transformation, not only did Wu Yunyue
                                            enhance his entire body, the icy cold sensation had been magnified to the
                                            maximum. </p>
                                        <p>The sword of the Demonic Emperor sliced through the Time Disorder Skill from
                                            a narrow crack, striking the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor’s sword. </p>
                                        <p>A loud clash was heard as a result.</p>
                                        <p>At the crucial moment, the Heavenly Emperor had unleashed his power. As
                                            though he was electrocuted, his entire body trembled violently. It was
                                            impossible for him to completely endure the strike from Wu Yunyue’s sword.
                                            The Evil Attribute was truly terrifying. </p>
                                        <p>However, in the next moment, his body unexpectedly separated. His phantom
                                            image shattered under the attack of the Demonic Emperor’s sword, but his
                                            actual body had already retreated more than ten meters behind, neutralizing
                                            a huge part of Wu Yunyue’s attack. </p>
                                        <p>Time Mirror Image? This was a high level Time Attribute skill. The mirror
                                            image that was created by a Heavenly Emperor was not entirely a phantom
                                            image. He would be able to maintain a certain degree of defensive strength
                                            in the mirror image and hence giving the actual body of the cultivator
                                            sufficient space to dodge the attack. The Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue’s
                                            sure-win attack was thus neutralized by his opponent under such a
                                            circumstance. </p>
                                        <p>A ray of light flashed across the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor’s eyes.
                                            Naturally, he could tell that the earlier attack by the Wu Yunyue was a
                                            fatal one that was meant to take his life. If he did not manage to use the
                                            Time Mirror Image to evade the attack, even if he did not die, he would have
                                            been severely injured.</p>
                                        <p>Wu Yunyue swung his sword, and in the next moment, the Passion Valley
                                            Heavenly Emperor retreated once again, dodging the attack. His body had
                                            charged upwards once again, causing the space surrounding him to become
                                            distorted. It enveloped both Wu Yunyue and him within it. At this moment,
                                            only Wu Yunyue and him were the only two people who knew what was happening
                                            within that area. All the other powerhouses gathered on the peak of the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain could no longer clearly see what was happening.</p>
                                        <p>The Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor appeared right before Wu Yunyue. His body
                                            and sword merged as one, charging towards Wu Yunyue’s chest. </p>
                                        <p>Even though Wu Yunyue was slightly passive due to his old sword techniques,
                                            he had a lot of combat experiences. His body followed the sword, and a
                                            cluster of dense dark blue light erupted from all directions, enveloping his
                                            entire body within it. It was indeed the unique defensive skill of the Life
                                            Attribute that was used to protect one’s life.</p>
                                        <p>The Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis bloomed with a myriad rays of light. Not
                                            only was it used for defensive purposes, at the same time, it rolled towards
                                            the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor. Following his movements, the Demonic
                                            Emperor’s sword swung upwards. </p>
