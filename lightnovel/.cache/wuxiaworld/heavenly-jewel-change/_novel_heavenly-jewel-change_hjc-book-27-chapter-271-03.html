                                            King Stage. Now that he had gained the Astral Feedback from another Heavenly
                                            Emperor and seven Heavenly Kings, in that instant it had pushed his
                                            cultivation stage to the next level… the Heavenly Emperor.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, even though Zhou Weiqing’s Soul was still critically injured, his
                                            cultivation base was about to raise to the Heavenly Emperor stage.</p>
                                        <p>Under normal circumstances, raising to the Heavenly Emperor stage was
                                            naturally a great thing. With the Astral Saint Energy reaching the next
                                            level, its strength and power could only be known after Zhou Weiqing tested
                                            it, but it was undoubtedly on another level. Alas, in his current situation,
                                            it was extremely dangerous.</p>
                                        <p>No matter breaking through from the nine Jeweled stage to the Heavenly King
                                            stage, or from the Heavenly King Stage to the Heavenly Emperor stage, those
                                            were no longer just a simple matter of a rise in cultivation base, nor was
                                            it as simple as a change in the Heavenly Core Nucleus. Instead, it was a
                                            total raising, from inside-out, from head to tail, from soul to body, from
                                            meridians, internal organs to bones.</p>
                                        <p>In the process of this ‘leveling up’, although the pain that one had to
                                            endure wasn’t that strong, it was after all a subliminal raising process,
                                            and if one’s soul was injured during this period, that posed a danger of the
                                            soul breaking down and being destroyed!</p>
                                        <p>What should I do? At this time, Zhou Weiqing was somewhat at a loss. He had
                                            never been in such a situation before, hence it was only normal that he did
                                            not know how to deal with it. The Astral Feedback could not be taken back.
                                            His body had already started to undergo some changes.</p>
                                        <p>Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue had
                                            been observing Zhou Weiqing. From their point of view, the golden light on
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s body had started becoming brighter and more intense after
                                            receiving the Astral Feedback. A layer of faint red appeared within the
                                            bright golden light; they merged together to form an even more magnificent
                                            reddish gold. The aura that he emitted had become more and more
                                            overwhelming.</p>
                                        <p>He was about to rank up again?! Entering the Heavenly Emperor stage? Both
                                            Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue stared in shock.</p>
                                        <p>After all, when the fight first started, Zhou Weiqing had only been at the
                                            High Level Heavenly King stage, and at the end of this fight, he was
                                            actually raising to the Heavenly Emperor stage. In their cases, they had
                                            taken several dozen years to actually enter the Heavenly Emperor stage, and
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation speed was truly toppling everything they knew
                                            about Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p>
                                        <p>“No, that’s not right. There is something wrong with his situation now.”
                                            Naturally, Long Shiya was far more familiar with his precious disciple than
                                            Wu Yunyue was, and he quickly realised the changes in Zhou Weiqing.
                                            Currently, although Zhou Weiqing was in the process of ranking up, his face
                                            was pale and ashen, and his body was trembling violently. The crimson gold
                                            glow that he was emitting as he hovered in midair was extremely unstable,
                                            giving the impression that it could break down at any time.</p>
                                        <p>This was definitely not the normal situation that would occur when a Heavenly
                                            King was rising to become a Heavenly Emperor. Long Shiya’s expression
                                            instantly changed. To him, the importance of his precious disciple was far
                                            above killing off all of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses.</p>
                                        <p>Vaguely, Long Shiya could also guess that Zhou Weiqing must have had
                                            encountered some problems during the fight with the First Elder previously,
                                            even though he was not sure of the exact details, as there were wounds on
                                            his body. Additionally, if a Heavenly Jewel Master were to forcefully evolve
                                            despite being heavily injured, it could bring about a devastating
                                            catastrophe.</p>
                                        <p>What pained Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor the most was that under such
                                            circumstances, he had no way of helping Zhou Weiqing at all. If Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s cultivation base was lower, for example, breaking through to the
                                            Seventh Jewel cultivation base from a Sixth Jewel cultivation base, Long
                                            Shiya would still be able to help him. However, the current Zhou Weiqing was
                                            about to advance to a Heavenly Emperor, with Astral Saint Energy. Under such
                                            circumstances, Long Shiya was unable to do anything for Zhou Weiqing even if
                                            he searched his soul. The evolution of Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base could
                                            very well become an incomparably formidable existence. If he were to
                                            interfere with this process, not only would it accelerate the crisis, he
                                            could also receive a backlash from his Astral Saint Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Long Shiya was pale with shock and was feeling extremely impatient,
                                            from afar, two sets of figures flashed from the sky like lightning. The two
                                            figures were extremely fast, and they seemed to be connected to each other.
                                            An enormous pair of greenish golden wings flapped continuously and very
                                            soon, they had arrived above the battlefield.</p>
                                        <p>“Who’s that?” Wu Yunyue exclaimed. He was about to flare up but Long Shiya
                                            held him back.</p>
                                        <p>“Wait, everyone stop. They’re on our side, they are here to help Weiqing
                                            breakthrough. Don’t act rashly.” Long Shiya’s words quickly allowed
                                            everything to calm down.</p>
                                        <p>The two figures swiftly reached Zhou Weiqing’s side, and the owner of the two
                                            giant green wings abruptly flung the other person in its arms towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Strangely speaking, the powerful gold Saint Energy around Zhou Weiqing did
                                            not seem to have the slightest rejection or aversion to these two
                                            newcomers.</p>
                                        <p>The one who had been flung out was a young lady, and as she flew out, her
                                            white gown billowed in the air, causing her to look like a celestial fairy
                                            descending from the heavens.</p>
                                        <p>In a flash, she had appeared before Zhou Weiqing. Without any hesitation, she
                                            spread her arms open and put her arms around Zhou Weiqing’s neck, hugging
                                            him tightly. At the same time, she lifted her head and kissed him on the
                                            lips.</p>
                                        <p>The two women who arrived abruptly were naturally Shangguan Bing’er and
                                            Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>Even though they did not take part in the battle, they had been observing
                                            closely at the side, along with the Heavenly Bow Empire powerhouses. After
                                            the dust had settled, the loud battle noises naturally died down. However,
                                            the light from the nebula in the sky remained.</p>
                                        <p>At this time, Tian’er suddenly had an extremely intense feeling. She sensed
                                            that there was something amiss about Zhou Weiqing’s situation. Since they
                                            both cultivated their Saint Energy together, it was natural for their
                                            feelings and mind to be interlinked. This was especially so over a short
                                            distance as such. Thus, Tian’er got Shangguan Bing’er to send her over
                                            immediately.</p>
                                        <p>At the moment when Tian’er kissed Zhou Weiqing, Zhou Weiqing’s body trembled
                                            even more vigorously. However in the next moment, both his hands were placed
                                            around Tian’er’s slender waist; immense reddish golden light rays directly
                                            rotated around the both of them, so strong that even Shangguan Bing’er was
                                            swept along.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, the Astral Saint Energy would not harm the two women, as their
                                            bodies were filled with Saint Energy. Even though they were not as strong as
                                            Zhou Weiqing, the two types of energy had the same source and were both
                                            creation energy, hence, they would not harm one another.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er had gotten used to cultivating with Zhou Weiqing during
                                            their journey to Xuantian Continent. Naturally, she did not want to let such
                                            a good opportunity slip by. She spread her wings open and kept her body
                                            hovering in the air while at the same time sensing the strong Astral Saint
                                            Energy in her surroundings, before she started cultivating.</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, it was a different situation with Tian’er and Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Almost without any hesitation, Zhou Weiqing channeled the massive Astral
                                            Saint Energy, that was about to be upgraded to Heavenly Emperor-level, into
                                            Tian’er’s body.</p>
                                        <p>Receiving such massive amount of energy from Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er’s body
                                            immediately turned into a shade of reddish gold. Zhou Weiqing started losing
                                            consciousness. Furthermore, he was currently being led by Tian’er - he
                                            completely had no clue as for whether it would hurt the baby in Tian’er’s
                                            belly by doing so. He had already lost the ability to judge; he was
                                            subconsciously looking for an outlet to let off vent.</p>
                                        <p>Something even stranger happened next. As Tian’er’s body turned into a shade
                                            of reddish gold, her belly also lit up. A layer of strange white sheen
                                            appeared on her belly.</p>
                                        <p>It was a tiny ball of light, in the form of pure white. When the white
                                            appeared, Zhou Weiqing’s strong and powerful Astral Saint Energy had
                                            actually lost its luster. All the reddish golden colors almost seemed to
                                            become more harmonious in an instant. They no longer circled around Zhou
                                            Weiqing - instead, they started circling around the tiny ball of white
                                            light.</p>
                                        <p>As the huge amount of upgraded Saint Energy left his body, Zhou Weiqing
                                            finally heaved a sigh of relief. His soul had also started to stabilize
                                            again. All he needed right now was time to restore his soul, which was not a
                                            difficult process.</p>
                                        <p>As he subconsciously opened his eyes, Zhou Weiqing saw Tian’er, who was being
                                            kissed by him. Suddenly, his body shook vigorously and his eyes were filled
                                            with shock and pain. How could I have channeled that massive amount of
                                            energy into Tian’er’s body?</p>
                                        <p>If Tian’er was not pregnant, it would have benefited her, as she would have
                                            gained her own energy from it. Since the Saint Energy was created by the
                                            both of them together, Tian’er would not reject any of it at all. However,
                                            the current situation was different - Tian’er was already pregnant; would
                                            receiving the massive amount of energy hurt the baby? If that was the case,
                                            Zhou Weiqing would definitely regret it for the rest of his life.</p>
                                        <p>However, Zhou Weiqing quickly realized something wasn’t right. He was
                                            surprised to discover that a special energy that made him feel comfortable,
                                            as though he had returned to the core of the universe, was continuously
                                            released by Tian’er, who was in his embrace.</p>
                                        <p>The energy was rather weak, but it was without a doubt a supreme one.</p>
                                        <p>All of the Astral Saint Energy seemed to have become its subjects, even the
                                            Astral Cloud in the skies had stopped spinning, a large amount of Astral
                                            Saint Energy descended from the sky, enveloping Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er and
                                            Shangguan Bing’er within it.</p>
                                        <p>Wasn’t that Astral Energy the same as Astral Feedback energy? However, Zhou
                                            Weiqing did not use the Heavenly Core Nucleus to conduct the Astral Feedback
                                            this time! Those energy were completely bestowed to them from countless
                                            stars in the sky.</p>
                                        <p>The gentle energy first surrounded Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, circling around
                                            them. Under the surge of Astral Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing’s broken soul
                                            recovered to its normal state in an instant.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing realized that the Saint Energy was different from the Astral
                                            Feedback that he had released earlier. Within the golden star light, there
                                            was a slight tinge of white. Although the white was very, very faint, it
                                            allowed his soul to be successfully restored at a rapid pace. Otherwise,
                                            Zhou Weiqing might not necessarily have discovered the existence of that
                                            special energy.</p>
                                        <p>Immediately after, the reddish golden energy that he had previously channeled
                                            into Tian’er’s body had poured back out and injected into him, causing Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s body to glow with a reddish golden light once again.</p>
                                        <p>Since Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s bodies were closely pressed against each
                                            other, the only person who could see the strange white glow that was emitted
                                            from Tian’er’s belly was none other than Shangguan Bing’er, who was in the
                                            sky.</p>
                                        <p><br/></p>
