                                            silent approval is still approval, and approval is agreement right? Hehehe,
                                            Sis, don’t deny it any further. I’m so happy today~ Don’t you know, these
                                            few days, I have been feeling so terrible. Now that you are here, I finally
                                            have someone to talk to. Tonight, let us sisters talk through the entire
                                            night!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er said: “Just now you said, that Zhou Weiqing has hope of
                                            surpassing me?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er nodded and said: “It’s not just a chance, but a
                                            certainty.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing her words, Shangguan Xue’er was instantly unwilling to accept it. As
                                            the heir to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she had always been the top of her
                                            generation. It could be said that even amongst all the disciples and heirs
                                            of the Five Great Saint Lands, she was still at the top of the pyramid. Zhou
                                            Weiqing did not even have the backing of any Great Saint Lands, though she
                                            had to admit his talent was not bad, but how could he possibly surpass
                                            herself with the Boundless Infinitum Set. No matter what, Shangguan Xue’er
                                            was unwilling to believe that was possible.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, Shangguan Fei’er could understand what her sister was thinking.
                                            With a smile, she said: “Sis, don’t think I am exaggerating or lying. Before
                                            I spent time with him, I was also unwilling to believe such a thing was
                                            possible, or that he could even surpass me. However, after all this time
                                            together, I have no choice but to accept that Little Fatty is truly a
                                            monster. The speed of his cultivation is just too shocking.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er furrowed her brow and said: “Well, say then, what sort of
                                            advancements has he made, and in what areas?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said: “Do you remember what stage he was at during the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament? As far as I know, when he first left the Fei Li
                                            Empire to join the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, he had just reached the Three
                                            Jeweled Stage, barely entering the Heavenly Shen Energy stage. Yet… now? His
                                            Heavenly Energy has already reached the Nineteenth Stage, almost reaching
                                            the Five-Jeweled Stage! This time, he is entering closed door cultivation
                                            for the purpose of breaking through to that Mid Level Zun Stage…That might
                                            seem like nothing to you or me, but just think about it, from three to five
                                            Jewels, how long has it taken him? It is only about a year… even for you …
                                            when you were at that stage, you never rose at such a speed right?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Shangguan Fei’er’s words, it was as if Shangguan Xue’er’s eyes were
                                            suddenly opened.</p>
                                        <p>All this time, she had never really put Zhou Weiqing on the same level as
                                            herself. Perhaps at most she had been surprised by his six Attributes,
                                            thinking his talent was just ‘not bad’.</p>
                                        <p>However, upon hearing her sister’s words, only then did she realise that it
                                            was indeed true. In just a year, his Heavenly Energy had raised six stages,
                                            and he was about to breakthrough to the Five-Jeweled stage. After all, the
                                            higher one’s Heavenly Energy cultivation level was, the harder it was to
                                            continue raising. At the three-Jeweled stage, perhaps Shangguan Xue’er’s
                                            speed was no lesser than Zhou Weiqing, but at the Five-Jeweled stage, her
                                            speed was already slower.</p>
                                        <p>Although it seemed like Zhou Weiqing was extremely far from Shangguan
                                            Xue’er’s current Seven-Jeweled cultivation level, she was suddenly reminded
                                            of a very pertinent fact by her sister’s words… a fact that she had
                                            overlooked before this.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er had previously told them that Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly
                                            Energy had only Awakened about four to five years ago. That meant that in
                                            just this short period of time, his Heavenly Energy had skyrocketed to what
                                            it currently was… from zero to the almost five-Jewels now. Furthermore, Zhou
                                            Weiqing was about two years younger than them, and did not previously have
                                            any support from any Great Saint Lands. Who knew what his cultivation level
                                            would grow to in two years time!</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er continued: “Now you understand what I mean right? That
                                            Immortal Deity Technique of Little Fatty’s is truly terrifying, almost
                                            disgusting even. Although we are unable to cultivate it, as it is almost
                                            tantamount to suicide, but it seems to have been made for him. With that
                                            cultivation technique, I am certain that before the nine-Jeweled stage, his
                                            speed of advancement will not slow much. That is to say… I estimate that
                                            within four to five years, maybe less, he will reach the Upper Level Zong
                                            Stage.”</p>
                                        <p>“By that time, who knows, he might actually even be able to reach the
                                            Heavenly King Stage before the age of thirty! That is something that not
                                            even Big Uncle was able to accomplish! Sis, just think about it, in four or
                                            five years, are you certain that you will definitely reach the Heavenly King
                                            Stage? Furthermore, we are slightly older than he is. That is the reason why
                                            I said that he would definitely be able to catch up with you in the
                                            future.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er looked at her gleeful little sister and said passively:
                                            “Heavenly Energy cultivation level is important, but it is also not the
                                            deciding factor for everything. Furthermore, all of that is just your
                                            estimations.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er laughed merrily as she said: “Sis, looks like you really
                                            aren’t convinced! Well, what about actual combat? Even though you have the
                                            Boundless Infinitum Set, that fellow also has the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’
                                            Legendary Set! Perhaps in terms of comparing Legendary Sets, his might be
                                            slightly weaker than yours, but how much of a difference can the two have?
                                            Do not forget, he also has the Demonic Change State and the Six Attribute
                                            Elemental Jewels. In terms of actual combat, I currently dare not say that I
                                            will definitely be able to defeat him. Even if I can, it will definitely be
                                            at a heavy price. This is even because I know most of his Skills very well.
                                            Although you are much stronger than I am, if you are not clear about his
                                            abilities, even if you can defeat him, it would also be at a heavy
                                            price.”</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, Shangguan Xue’er giggled. “Fei’er, do you know what you look
                                            like now?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er started momentarily before saying: “What do I look
                                            like?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er continued saying laughingly: “Just now, you looked totally
                                            like a mother hen protecting her little chicks. You haven’t even married
                                            that fellow yet, and you are already so protective of him. Well, besides the
                                            fact he hasn’t caught up with me yet, even if he becomes stronger than me,
                                            so what? Anyway, we are not enemies.”</p>
                                        <p>“Sis, you dare say I am like a mother hen?! I… I…” As she said that,
                                            Shangguan Fei’er suddenly sprang savagely at Shangguan Xue’er.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>While the two sisters were joking around with each other at one side, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had started his closed door cultivation in his own tent.</p>
                                        <p>This time, the closed door cultivation was not at Long Shiya’s behest, but
                                            something he had requested of his own accord. After being taught by Long
                                            Shiya, Zhou Weiqing became clearer and clearer about his own flaws and what
                                            he lacked. On the surface, his talents were amazing. However, he had not
                                            been in the Heavenly Jewel Master world for long, and his flaws were
                                            plentiful as well. These flaws might not seem like much, some extremely
                                            tiny, but if an enemy managed to grab hold of one and make use of it, it
                                            could be a possible point that sent him to eternal doom.</p>
                                        <p>More importantly, the Peerless Battalion had been replenished with so many
                                            new men, and Zhou Weiqing could feel the weight on his shoulders increasing.
                                            Although he did not speak out about this, that feeling in his heart was
                                            definitely growing. Closed door cultivation to break through to the
                                            Five-Jeweled cultivation level was his current goal. Furthermore, this time,
                                            he would do so by training in the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts while
                                            in Demonic Change State.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya would remain in the same tent as Zhou Weiqing throughout this
                                            period. During the time when Zhou Weiqing was training in the Six Ultimate
                                            Skill Manipulation Arts, he would give detailed pointers and correct any
                                            mistakes.</p>
                                        <p>In his eyes, Zhou Weiqing’s passion and persistence towards cultivation was
                                            far below his own. Back in those days, Long Shiya had gone through so much
                                            in order to increase his cultivation and gain power, barely forging his way
                                            through countless of trials and tribulations. Yet, at the same time, he had
                                            no choice but to admit that this disciple of his was far superior to himself
                                            in terms of understanding and comprehension. In addition to his other
                                            talents, it was definitely a startling cultivation speed. If he examined
                                            himself, Long Shiya knew that he was already being extremely critical and
                                            strict, but Zhou Weiqing would still give him a pleasant surprise every day.
                                            The Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts in his disciple’s hands was slowing
                                            starting to look decent. After all these days, at least in terms of the
                                            first stage of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            already starting to enter deeper and at a much more stable state. At least
                                            for all Skills below the Five-Jeweled stage, he was already able to mimic
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, that was not to say that Zhou Weiqing would practice mimicking
                                            every single Skill, but it was more a particular talent or attribute that he
                                            had to master in mimicking; basically training hard in the Six Ultimate
                                            Skill Manipulation Arts’ mimicking capabilities. As the saying goes ‘The
                                            Methods used may vary, but the Principle always remains the same’. As long
                                            as he knew the key to the method, it would be much easier to mimic any Skill
                                            within his capabilities.</p>
                                        <p>To Zhou Weiqing, having two months to breakthrough to the Five-Jeweled stage
                                            was not a particularly difficult task. After all, his Immortal Deity
                                            Technique was truly ‘disgusting’. Just like what Shangguan Fei’er had said,
                                            the speed of growth of his Heavenly Energy had never slowed, not even as his
                                            cultivation level increased.</p>
                                        <p>Normally, Heavenly Energy cultivation would become harder and harder as one’s
                                            cultivation level increased. However, in Zhou Weiqing’s case, whenever he
                                            raised a stage of Heavenly Energy, his own Death Acupuncture energy
                                            whirlpools would also increase by one, and the draw from the atmospheric
                                            energy was greatly increased, and this would offset the extra difficulty in
                                            cultivation speed.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Zhou Weiqing had been very worried what would happen to him after
                                            reaching the thirty sixth Stage of Heavenly Energy and reaching the Heavenly
                                            Xu Stage and the Heavenly King Stage. After all, that was the limit of the
                                            Immortal Deity Technique with the thirty six Death Acupuncture Points, and
                                            he did not have another higher level cultivation technique. Now, he did not
                                            need to worry too much about the future; with a teacher like Long Shiya,
                                            that was no longer any problem. At least, before he broke through the
                                            Heavenly King Stage, it was clear that Long Shiya would not easily leave his
                                            side.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing entered the close door cultivation, everyday he would enter
                                            the Demonic Change State to train in all his various Skills, not just to
                                            train in the ‘Ice Cold Perception’, increasing his senses and knowledge in
                                            the profound secrets in that state, but also to increase the time he could
                                            remain in that state. At the same time, he was also constantly improving in
                                            his Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts and Heavenly Energy. It could be
                                            said that it was not only training in Skill usage, but also Heavenly Energy,
                                            without neglecting either. This was Zhou Weiqing’s greatest advantage
                                            compared to any other Heavenly Jewel Master, an advantage from the Immortal
                                            Deity Technique, the advantage that would allow him to slowly catch up with
                                            the Shangguan Sisters.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, the development of the Peerless Battalion was on the right
                                            path, following the instructions that Zhou Weiqing had laid out. The three
                                            thousand new ruffians who had joined were quickly dispersed amongst the
                                            various new Companies, and with the lure of food and money, as well as the
                                            ‘propaganda’ from the older Peerless Battalion soldiers, soon converted them
                                            all.</p>
