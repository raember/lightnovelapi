                                            armour was starting to show signs of wear and tear from the constant strike
                                            of the sabres of the Wolf Cavalry soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>“Haaaah!” Zhou Weiqing shouted loudly, a powerful yet cold aura of bloodlust
                                            bursting forth from his body in an explosive manner along with his shout.
                                            The angry howl could be clearly heard by the entire battlefield of several
                                            tens of thousands of warriors. The few of the closest war wolf mounts
                                            actually had their legs buckle and they fell to the ground from the sheer
                                            force of the shout. The immense powerful pressure of the Dark Demon God
                                            Tiger bloodline was released as he entered the Demonic Change State. In
                                            doing so, he was also able to help relieve some pressure from the Gold Crow
                                            Tribe and Berserker Tribe at the same time.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he entered the Demonic Change State, his beleaguered titanium mail
                                            was  forced open, and he just threw it aside to reveal a body full of rock
                                            hard muscles. His upper body naked, the tiger tattoos swirled with black
                                            light, giving him an extra wild and violent look.</p>
                                        <p>Instantly, he used the Tornado Strike, with both Hammers in hand, forcefully
                                            carving a path of blood almost ten yards long like a raging bulldozer, with
                                            at least twenty Wolf Cavalry soldiers knocked out of his path. It was truly
                                            any slight graze causing injury, and a direct collision was death. The ‘Hate
                                            Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set coupled with the explosive power of the
                                            Demonic Change State could only be described as disgusting. From the start
                                            of the fight until now, the number of soldiers who had died under Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s hammers already totalled an entire Company!</p>
                                        <p><i>It’s definitely him… </i></p>
                                        <p>The moment Barthez saw Zhou Weiqing enter the Demonic Change State, he
                                            immediately thought about his big brother’s description of his fight.
                                            Without question, this Dual Hammer wielding fellow was the damn brat who had
                                            injured his big brother.</p>
                                        <p>Barthez had definitely took his brother’s poisoned injury to heart, and
                                            wanted to take revenge. Of course, with his brother’s warning in mind, he
                                            would not underestimate the young fighter.</p>
                                        <p>“Bathulu Sabre Formation!”</p>
                                        <p>Barthez shouted out loud. He did not continue charging forward. After all,
                                            with his big brother’s powerful nine-Jeweled cultivation level, he had still
                                            fallen prey to this youth’s trickery. His own power was no match for his big
                                            brother’s, what if he too fell to that terrifying venom?</p>
                                        <p>As the Wolf Cavalry soldiers heard Barthez’s order, their formation which had
                                            started to fall into disarray started to stabilize and reform, spreading out
                                            momentarily. The next instant, they all shouted “Bathulu!” in anger. Their
                                            large sabres all flew out with a strange aura, striking out towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing from all directions.</p>
                                        <p>This was a special formation created by the Wolf Cavalry soldiers specially
                                            against Heavenly Jewel Master powerhouses, a fighting style and technique
                                            designed to take down a lone person far more powerful than themselves. After
                                            all, no matter how strong a Heavenly Jewel Master was, he ultimately still
                                            had a limit to the amount of Heavenly Energy he had. In theory, even a
                                            Heavenly God Tier powerhouse could be surrounded and eventually killed.</p>
                                        <p>The sabres were infused with the powerful totemic energies of the Wolfman
                                            warriors, full of bloodthirst and wild rage. Most importantly, mixed within
                                            the sabre formation were also the sabres that the Heavenly Jewel Masters of
                                            the Wolfmen Tribe had thrown out, and if one was not careful, it would be
                                            easy to get struck.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a cold humph, the Hammers in his hands swirling about. At
                                            the same time, a bout of green light flew out from his hammer, causing a
                                            green circle of airflow to form around his body. The various sabres were
                                            furled up by the green light and thrown away before returning to the Wolf
                                            Cavalry soldiers. Some of the unluckier ones were actually struck by their
                                            own returning sabres, and once again blood filled the scene.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing was filled with bloodlust, excited with the fight.
                                            All of a sudden, a loud clanging sound, and a sabre actually forcefully
                                            broke through Zhou Weiqing’s Wind Attribute protective whirlwind. Although
                                            Zhou Weiqing reacted extremely quickly, using the haft of his hammer to
                                            strike at it, the power imbued within the sabre was just too strong, and it
                                            also had a violent Wind Attribute Skill within. In a flash of green light,
                                            it struck down at Zhou Weiqing’s sabre.</p>
                                        <p>The Immortal Deity Technique and its Immortal Deity Shield came into effect.
                                            Where the green light struck, a layer of thick white light shone, blocking
                                            and warding off most of the offensive power. At the same time, his
                                            formidable physique after the Demonic Change State also helped mitigate some
                                            of the damage. Even so, a wound appeared on his shoulder, blood seeping out.
                                            Although the wound started healing with the aid of the Demonic Change State,
                                            and he did not feel much pain in such a state, Zhou Weiqing was still taken
                                            by surprise.</p>
                                        <p>In the Demonic Change State, he had the power of the ‘Ice Cold Perception’.
                                            Yet, he had not been able to discover the difference of that particular
                                            sabre and the strength it held. One could imagine, the that sabre definitely
                                            had some unique Skill imbued within, perhaps something similar to Silent
                                            Tracking Arrow Shangguan Bing’er had once used. Furthermore, the person who
                                            threw that sabre was definitely not too close to him, and to be able to
                                            break past all his various defenses to actually injure him, that meant he
                                            was a powerhouse of at least six-Jeweled cultivation level or higher.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, the knife had been thrown by Barthez. All this while, he had been
                                            standing not far off waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike, and he
                                            had finally succeeded in injuring Zhou Weiqing. Alas, the wound was not deep
                                            or serious at all. However, stuck in the sabre formation, Zhou Weiqing did
                                            not have the time to look for him.</p>
                                        <p>Barthez gave a cold smirk. No matter how powerful a person was or how great
                                            the Skills he had, it was still personal strength. Compared to the strength
                                            of an entire well trained army, death would still be the final result for
                                            him.</p>
                                        <p>On this side, Zhou Weiqing’s trio seemed to be stuck in a tight corner.
                                            However, on the other side, for the Peerless Battalion First Main Company,
                                            the reverse was true.</p>
                                        <p>Without Zhou Weiqing’s direction, Hua Feng also knew how to fight this
                                            battle. Their ultimate goal was to rescue the Gold Crow and Berserker
                                            Tribes, but at the same time, the precondition was that they had to preserve
                                            the strength of the Peerless Battalion, to incur as few losses as
                                            possible.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment charge towards them, the Peerless
                                            Battalion’s Consolidated Bows showed their power once more.</p>
                                        <p>If they fired from a distance of more than five hundred yards, perhaps with
                                            the power of the Unicorn Cavalry troops, their skill, training and sheer
                                            physique, it might be possible for them to block the arrows. However, Hua
                                            Feng waited specifically until they had charged to within the range of five
                                            hundred yards before he gave the order to shoot once more. In just a single
                                            salvo, several hundred Unicorn Cavalry troops had fallen once more. This
                                            time, their enemies were just too many, and they could no longer spare the
                                            time to deal with the Unicorn Beasts as well, mainly shooting down the
                                            riders as priority. Without the riders’ directions, those Unicorn Beasts
                                            would not be able to stay properly in formation and attack.</p>
                                        <p>These Unicorn Beasts were indeed extremely fast, especially with their
                                            gliding capabilities, able to instantaneously burst forth with a sudden
                                            terrifying speed for a short period of time.</p>
                                        <p>From the time the Peerless Battalion First Main Company had started shooting,
                                            they only managed to shoot five rounds of arrows before the Unicorn Cavalry
                                            Regiment had charged to the three hundred yard distance. At this distance,
                                            the Unicorn Cavalry were finally able to make use of their own longbows to
                                            retaliate, and arrows also began to be shot forth from their side.</p>
                                        <p>However, to the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment Leader Campora’s anger, as soon as
                                            that happened, the Peerless Battalion actually turned tail and ran. They did
                                            not seem to have any intentions of staying to clash with them, and the most
                                            hateful thing was that as these fellows ran, they constantly turned back to
                                            fire some arrows, continuously taking a toll on his men.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of overall combat strength, the Unicorn Beasts were definitely above
                                            the War Wolves. However, just in terms of speed, besides the burst of speed
                                            when they were using their gliding charge, their usual speed was actually no
                                            match for the War Wolves. Of course, that was still faster than ordinary
                                            horses. Still, that was still a limit of how much faster they could be. As
                                            the Peerless Battalion were fleeing at full speed, it was not going to be
                                            easy to catch up with them in a short amount of time. At the same time, the
                                            Peerless Battalion’s archery was not to be trifled with, and the front lines
                                            of the chasing Unicorn Cavalry Regiment was constantly being shot down, thus
                                            causing their chasing speed to slow down slightly.</p>
                                        <p>Campora could only place hope in their own bows and arrows causing enough
                                            harm to their enemies. The Unicorn Cavalry troops were well geared in terms
                                            of equipment and their longbows were finely crafted, able to shoot pretty
                                            accurately at the three hundred yard range.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, very soon, Campora wanted to start cursing out loud. The reason was
                                            simple - the Peerless Battalion soldiers did not seem to even care about
                                            their arrows, not even bothering to dodge.</p>
                                        <p>Besides the difference in accuracy, just the difference in the effect of
                                            being struck with arrows on both sides was just too huge, more than enough
                                            to cause Campora to be so enraged that he wanted to puke out blood.</p>
                                        <p>On the side of the Unicorn Cavalry troops, if they were struck by the
                                            titanium arrows shot by those powerful Consolidated Bows, even if they did
                                            not die, they would be knocked out or be out of fighting shape. Yet, what
                                            about their opponents? They were armed to the teeth, and they totally
                                            ignored the incoming arrows, allowing them to bounce off their titanium
                                            mail. They were even using their own small round shields to protect their
                                            horses’ behind!</p>
                                        <p>At a distance of two to three hundred yards, how could ordinary bows and
                                            arrows break through the defense of the titanium mails the Peerless
                                            Battalion were wearing? At most, it would leave a small mark.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion warriors were extremely overjoyed. No matter how their
                                            enemies fired, they remained injury free. Such a feeling was just too
                                            amazing. As they retreated, they continued firing, and the death and injury
                                            toll on the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment continued growing steadily. The power
                                            of the Consolidated Bows when in such numbers was not to be easily
                                            dismissed. Even though the Unicorn Cavalry troops also had armour, how could
                                            it be compared to the titanium alloy mail of the Peerless Battalion?</p>
                                        <p>The Unicorn Cavalry Troops did not have the same charging technique as the
                                            Wolf Cavalry Troops. They did not shrink their formation or use a single
                                            line charge to reduce the damage. Instead, they spread into two sides,
                                            pincering down onto their opponents like a massive claw.</p>
                                        <p>“Target their horses, shoot down all their horses!” Campora howled in anger.
                                            In just a matter of minutes, he had lost yet another Battalion of men. How
                                            could he not be enraged? In today’s’ fight, his entire Regiment had already
                                            lost at least three whole Battalions worth of fine warriors!</p>
                                        <p>Campora’s plan finally worked. As soon as the Unicorn Cavalry soldiers
                                            started targeting their enemies’ mounts, this tactic of fighting while
                                            beating a retreat by the Peerless Battalion was finally halted in their
                                            tracks.</p>
                                        <p>After all, those warhorses were not equipped with titanium mail like they
                                            were. Although the twenty or so officers led by Hua Feng on their Ghost
                                            Demon Horses were staying at the back to defend the retreat, and they had
                                            their shields to protect their steeds, their numbers were just not enough to
                                            protect the entire Main Company, and there were constantly Peerless
                                            Battalion soldiers whose horses were killed.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the individual power and combat abilities of the finest of the
                                            Peerless Battalion, the First Main Company, showed itself. Every time a
                                            soldier’s steed was killed, a companion at the side would quickly pull him
                                            up on his own horseback. As such, the chasing Unicorn Cavalry Regiment could
                                            only see horses perish, but not a single Peerless Battalion soldier had been
                                            killed thus far.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, this will not do. Eventually, we will not be able to save everyone.”
                                            At this moment, Yi Shi was extremely serious, a rare sight for ‘her’, as she
                                            said solemnly to Hua Feng.</p>
                                        <p>The seven God Archers of the Heavenly Bow Unit had definitely killed the most
                                            enemies. Each arrow they shot out at least killing one or more enemies.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng looked to Mu En, who nodded back to him. “Everyone, dismount. Use
                                            your horses as temporary shelter. Get ready for close combat!”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, they had not heard the wrong command. Hua Feng had ordered for them
                                            to fight in close combat, not to rise up into the air!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing wanted to train and temper the Peerless Battalion, and just
                                            being skilled in ranged combat was far from sufficient. After all, once
                                            their enemies were familiar with the Peerless Battalion, it was easy to
                                            start specially countering their ranged capabilities. Eventually, it would
                                            be impossible to avoid fighting in close range. Only with continuous actual
                                            combat experience could these Peerless Battalion soldiers put their close
                                            combat training to use, making it their own and soaking thoroughly in it.
                                            This would bring up the entire quality of the Peerless Battalion, to make
                                            them an all rounded elite unit.</p>
