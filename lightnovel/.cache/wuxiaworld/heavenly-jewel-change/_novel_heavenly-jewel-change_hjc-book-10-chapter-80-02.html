                                            focus being a powerful physical strength. When cultivation, all their
                                            Physical Jewels are Consolidated with Equipment that boosts their Strength.
                                            At the same time, all their Elemental Jewels are Stored with the same Skill
                                            - Flame Strength Blast. This Flame Strength Blast Skill is actually a very
                                            simple skill, simply adding an explosive strength to one’s attacks.”</p>
                                        <p>“Although this skill is only rated at three-stars, it has quite an obvious
                                            increase in strength. Furthermore, with the Secret Arts Fire Warrior Storing
                                            this Skill multiple times, with their effects stacking, although it might
                                            not be to such a degree like Boss’ Assembly Set Shield, it is still able to
                                            boost their strength to a considerable, almost terrifying degree. Of course,
                                            the drawback of this cultivation method is that there is almost no
                                            possibility of breaking past to the ninth Jewel level or higher. That is to
                                            say, his highest possible future level will only be an Upper Level Zong
                                            Stage. As such, anyone with outstanding talent would not choose such an
                                            extreme method of cultivation. However, at lower levels, they indeed have a
                                            huge advantage over most others, especially in the battlefield where they
                                            are nearly unstoppable.”</p>
                                        <p>“It is rumoured that several hundred years ago, there was an army formed out
                                            of Secret Arts Fire Warriors, all of whom were at the Upper Level Zong
                                            Stage. Although they only numbered a hundred people, they were almost
                                            invincible in the battlefield. Even Heavenly King Powerhouses were not
                                            willing to face them. For now, we do not know how much of the combat styles
                                            and secrets of the Secret Arts Fire Warrior Xu Chuan has mastered, but we do
                                            not need to worry that much; after all, the true power of the Secret Arts
                                            Fire Warriors are usually only when they reach the Zong Stage.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Xiao Yan’s explanation, Zhou Weiqing’s interest in these secret arts
                                            were definitely piqued. In truth, these so called secrets were mainly in the
                                            the matching of Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills. The explosive
                                            power of Fire fused with the Strength Attribute… and how they matched
                                            together.</p>
                                        <p>In order words, having the Physical and Elemental Jewels focusing on boosting
                                            in the same direction. This was also the base principle behind all the
                                            Ultimate Heavenly Jewel Masters, like the Ultimate Agility of Shangguan
                                            Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was a Consolidating Equipment Master, and hearing about these
                                            Secret Arts Fire Warriors, it was as if a door opened in his mind,
                                            broadening his horizons and giving him much food for thought. Of course, it
                                            was not for himself, but rather for his classmates and Followers who would
                                            be using his own Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. They could be said to have
                                            just entered the Jewel Master world, though they were not Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters and were still low level, this would also allow him to shape
                                            them!</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the fight on the stage was reaching its climax.</p>
                                        <p>As a Secret Arts Fire Warrior, Xu Chuan’s strength was not inferior to
                                            Crow’s. As such, as both of the clashed time and again, the shockwaves
                                            reverberated around the plaza, causing the sturdy stage to tremble.</p>
                                        <p>Crow’s face was calm, the axes in her hands swirling about with all her
                                            martial skill, smashing hard into Xu Chuan’s hammers as he flew about in mid
                                            air, making use of the force of their blows to stay in the air, then using
                                            the downward force of his blows to increase their strength against Crow.</p>
                                        <p>Such a contest of strength was definitely a crowd pleaser, and the audience
                                            cheers swamped the entire plaza like waves. As compared to the first fight,
                                            this one definitely roused their spirits and fired their blood.</p>
                                        <p>In their Resting House, Zhou Weiqing, Lin TianAo and the rest of the team
                                            were smiling. They knew that barring any major surprises, they had secured
                                            this fight.</p>
                                        <p>Although Xu Chuan’s secret arts had allowed him to boost his strength to
                                            terrifying levels, it was still after all the boosts from his Consolidated
                                            Equipment AND Stored Skills.</p>
                                        <p>On the other hand, Crow was only using Heavenly Energy to boost herself,
                                            mainly using her own physique inherited from being a member of the Gold Crow
                                            Tribe. She had not even used her Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills at
                                            all!</p>
                                        <p>As such, despite seemingly a stalemate, the disparity in terms of expenditure
                                            of Heavenly Energy was huge. Xu Chuan would eventually tire himself out, and
                                            though Crow’s cultivation level was lower than his and with a lower total
                                            amount of Heavenly Energy, she would definitely be able to outlast him… and
                                            by then, there would be no doubt in who the victor would be.</p>
                                        <p>As for Xu Chuan constantly staying in mid air, it might seem he was taking
                                            the initiative in doing so, making use of gravity. In truth, any skilled
                                            practitioner could tell that it was actually Crow who had the situation in
                                            hand, forcing him to be unable to land.</p>
                                        <p>Any human’s strength came from their physique, connected to the earth. Only
                                            then would they be able to leverage positioning, leveraging their own
                                            strength, and deflecting opponent’s strength. With her martial combat
                                            skills, Crow had been able to force Xu Chuan to stay in mid air, not giving
                                            him the time to slow down, recover; he could only attack continuously and
                                            clash forcefully.</p>
                                        <p>She wanted to end this as soon as possible.</p>
                                        <p>Xu Chuan naturally understood this as well. Alas, Crow’s strength was just
                                            too terrifying, as was her skill with the axes, and once she had gotten the
                                            advantage, he was unable to leverage anything to break himself out of the
                                            rut.</p>
                                        <p>Although he had seen all of Crow’s other fights, at that point he had just
                                            felt that her strength was powerful, but that he was no weaker. Only now
                                            that he fought her personally did he know he was wrong. Just standing there,
                                            Crow gave him the impression like she was an insurmountable mountain. Every
                                            clash reverberated right through his body, causing his body to feel a quick
                                            numbness, and his arms slowly started feeling leaden.</p>
                                        <p>Crow - Six hundred jin of weight, and a thousand three hundred jin weight of
                                            the legendary axes.</p>
                                        <p>Such a terrifying mass accompanied by her strength, one could never imagine
                                            the sheer power without experiencing it for themselves. This was simply not
                                            human. As compared to her physical strength, the boost from her Heavenly
                                            Energy and Fire Attribute Skills were much lesser.</p>
                                        <p>Such a clash of pure strength was naturally a huge drain on a Secret Arts
                                            Fire Warrior like Xu Chuan. After all, he was still at the four-Jeweled
                                            cultivation level, and was not able to fully make use of all their secret
                                            arts to their maximum capabilities. Feeling his energy draining rapidly, he
                                            was starting to get worried.</p>
                                        <p>In the next clash, when Xu Chuan’s body bounced back upwards in midair, he
                                            gave an abrupt shout, the diminishing flames around his body suddenly flared
                                            out once more, blazing in a new life as the red flames turned orange. His
                                            entire aura suddenly changed as well.</p>
                                        <p>Strangely, he actually paused in midair for a second, before he struck
                                            downwards at Crow once more.</p>
                                        <p>This time, his speed was obviously slower than before, but the hammers in his
                                            hands were stained an orange red flame, giving it a horrifying feel that
                                            struck to the very soul.</p>
                                        <p>Just like how all the members of the Fei Li Battle Team were so adamant about
                                            victory, so was the Bai Da Battle Team. In order to achieve victory, Xu
                                            Chuan was not afraid to sacrifice himself.</p>
                                        <p>In the Fei Li Battle Team Rest House, everyone stood up abruptly on seeing
                                            what had happened. What Xu Chuan was using was just too familiar to them… as
                                            Xiao Yan had just used it previously against Little Witch - Igniting his
                                            Flame of Life!</p>
                                        <p>In order to secure this victory, Xu Chuan had decided to ignite his flame of
                                            life before he fully ran out of Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>The watching members of the Fei Li Battle Team gripped their fists tightly,
                                            their eyes filled with concern. Even though Crow’s strength and defense were
                                            formidable, could she face down Xu Chuan who was pitting his life to use his
                                            Flame of Life?</p>
                                        <p>However, in the next instant, everyone was stunned, as the scene played out
                                            in front of them in an unbelievable way.</p>
                                        <p>*Swooosh* Without any warning, or any leverage, Crow suddenly shot back over
                                            a dozen yards, her axes held in front of her protectively. No one knew when
                                            she had done it, but only the members of the Fei Li Battle Team could see
                                            from their vantage point that Crow had somehow attached her Consolidated
                                            Equipment Chain to the edge of the stage. Indeed, she had made use of the
                                            chain to pull herself backwards instantaneously without any leverage.</p>
                                        <p>*BANG*</p>
                                        <p>Alas… unfortunately for Xu Chuan, the blow for which he had risked his life
                                            smashed savagely into the floor of the stage. It was as if a meteor had
                                            struck the diamond hard stage, with rubble and dust spraying into the air
                                            along with the huge explosion, erupting into the air like a ferocious
                                            volcano. As the air cleared, a twenty yard diameter huge crater was revealed
                                            in the center of the stage, and the very atmosphere around the stage seemed
                                            to have turned orange-red with the sheer heat.</p>
                                        <p>The explosion was just too violent, the resulting shockwaves still
                                            reverberating across the plaza, almost breaking the various Rest Houses as
                                            the wave passed them.</p>
                                        <p>Although Xu Chuan’s cultivation level was only four-Jeweled, such a strike
                                            with his ignited Flames of Life behind it, even a six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master would not want to take such a blow easily.</p>
                                        <p>It took the time of several breaths before the intense heat in the air
                                            dissipated, though the air was still dusty. At that point, another dark red
                                            light lit up, flying forward with a *wuuu* sound. “WE SURRENDER!!” Lang Xie
                                            shouted out immediately. Alas… he was too late.</p>
                                        <p>One of Crow’s Legendary Axes, weighing over six hundred jin, spun in the air
                                            with a deatly air, burying itself deep into Xu Chuan’s chest. Already weak
                                            from burning up his Flame of Life, Xu Chuan was smashed to the ground by
                                            it.</p>
                                        <p>With its weight and Crow’s strength, such a blow was at least three thousand
                                            jin or more, let alone the fact that it was the axe blade that bit into his
                                            body.</p>
                                        <p>Not even mentioning the fact that Xu Chuan was an ordinary Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master; even if he were a Gold Crow Tribe member like Crow, their reinforced
                                            skin and bones would not be able to take such a blow. His entire chest caved
                                            in and split apart, every single rib and lungs smashed into bits. Before he
                                            could even cry out, Xu Chuan’s life had been swiftly taken by the flying
                                            axe.</p>
                                        <p>Crow stood up from the other side of the stage, looking at the judge
                                            innocently: “Aiiii, he was so fierce, I thought he still had the fight in
                                            him. Leader Lang Xie, you should have surrendered for him earlier, look,
                                            making me feel so bad… sigh… to have a life just gone like this. I didn’t do
                                            this on purpose, alas you were too slow in admitting defeat.”</p>
                                        <p>“You….!” Lang Xie almost spat out a mouthful of blood in rage as he glared at
                                            Crow, the flames in his eyes. The other Bai Da Battle Team Members were also
                                            enraged, almost charging forward towards Crow.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, several ZhongTian officials from the Skill Storing
                                            Palace appeared, blocking their path.</p>
                                        <p>When they released their six sets of Heavenly Jewels, no matter how angry the
                                            Bai Da Battle Team members were, they had no choice but to hold themselves
                                            back.</p>
                                        <p>Even the judge on the stage couldn’t bear to look at the mangled corpse of Xu
                                            Chuan. Crow walked over, pulling her axe from his body, a sorrowful look on
                                            her face as she mourned: “Aiii, I did not want to kill you… Why did you have
                                            to be born in the Bai Da Empire? Alas, you shouldn’t have called yourself a
                                            Secret Arts Fire Warrior; without learning their secrets properly, you dared
                                            come on the stage to play around, sigh… dying in my hands, it was not unjust
                                            after all.”</p>
                                        <p>After the judge proclaimed the Fei Li Battle Team victory, Crow walked down
                                            the stage.</p>
                                        <p>Such a bloody scene caused the entire audience to lapse into silence. They
                                            had originally been looking forward to an exciting fight, but only then did
                                            they realise that the hate between the two empires were to such a degree.
                                            This was truly a fight to the death for both sides.</p>
                                        <p>As the officials once again cleared up the stage, the members of the Bai Da
                                            Battle Team all had bloodshot eyes. Under such a circumstance of certain
                                            victory, Crow had still finished off Xu Chuan; this had definitely angered
                                            all of them.</p>
                                        <p></p>
