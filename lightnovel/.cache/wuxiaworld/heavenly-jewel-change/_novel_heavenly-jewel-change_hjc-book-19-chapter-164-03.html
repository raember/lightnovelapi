                                            areas, causing many of the Heavy Infantry soldiers to be curled on the
                                            ground, clutching their precious areas, their heads not daring to even lift
                                            up. It was truly a sorry sight.</p>
                                        <p>After this event, many of the Heavy Infantry soldiers were left with a shadow
                                            in their psyche. Although that ‘vital area’ of theirs was protected by thick
                                            armour, when they examined their own armours, they discovered that the
                                            damage to many of their armours were mostly to that area… if the Peerless
                                            Battalion soldiers had used more force, perhaps they would have lost the
                                            capabilities of being a man.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander Hua Feng, quick, get your Peerless Battalion men to
                                            stop!” Shen Ji said exasperatedly.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng blinked his eyes innocently and said: “Ohh, Legion Commander Shen
                                            Ji, your command was just too fast. These men of mine, their reactions are
                                            just too slow, unable to keep up. Everyone… Stop!” Hua Feng was not as loud
                                            as Shen Ji, and he had to shout several times. In the end, Shangguan Fei’er
                                            had to shout a few times as well in the middle of the battlefield before the
                                            ruffians of the Peerless Battalion stopped, looking unwilling.</p>
                                        <p>Ordinarily, in their training against their fellow soldiers, although the
                                            fights were bustling indeed, but they did have to take guard against future
                                            vengeance! Only when they were fighting against outsiders could take unleash
                                            all their vicious strength without holding back.</p>
                                        <p>Both sides finally stopped. Yet, the greatest injuries were perhaps an
                                            unknown number of dislocated jaws… all those Northwest Army officers, each
                                            of them with blacker and blacker faces. Ahhh their money! How much money had
                                            they lost!! Many of them had bet several months of their pay! The worst off
                                            was naturally the Heavy Infantry soldiers; not only had they been beaten up
                                            so heavily, some of their armour even out of shape… they had also lost a
                                            huge amount of their wagers. In a long period of time after, any time the
                                            phrase Peerless Battalion was mentioned, groans of sorrow could be heard:
                                            “Ahhh, those Peerless Battalion bastards are truly not human!”</p>
                                        <p>“Legion Commander Shen Ji, about our previous bet…” Hua Feng subtly asked in
                                            reminder.</p>
                                        <p>By now, Shen Ji had calmed down. Although technically he had lost, and was
                                            also a loss of face to himself, once he calmed down, he found that his mood
                                            was actually quite good. Perhaps it was his finest elite Regiment, the ace
                                            of his Seventh Legion, who had lost, but do not forget that technically the
                                            Peerless Battalion belonged to the Seventh Legion. More importantly, this
                                            time, they would be helping the Seventh Legion on the battlefield. With them
                                            and the Heavy Infantry Regiment, it would be a win win cooperation against
                                            powerhouses… and that was not a bad thing for Shen Ji indeed.</p>
                                        <p>“I have lost. We will go ahead according to the terms of our bet as promised.
                                            However, I will still have to speak a lot and arrange things with the Heavy
                                            Infantry Regiment first.”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng smiled gracefully and said: “I’ll have to trouble Legion Commander
                                            Shen Ji then. Do not worry Legion Comander, on the battlefield, our Peerless
                                            Battalion will not disappoint you.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji looked at Hua Feng meaningfully for a moment before finally saying:
                                            “I truly hope so.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, he turned around to leave, without even looking back.
                                            Having dealings with these ruffians was not an enjoyable task indeed. This
                                            temporary Commander Hua Feng was even more troublesome than that Zhou
                                            Weiqing. At least, on the surface, most of the times Zhou Weiqing was very
                                            amiable and was easy to get along with, but this Hua Feng fellow was sly and
                                            cunning . If he continued staying here, perhaps that Hua Feng would come up
                                            with another sneaky plan to trick him.</p>
                                        <p>After that fight, the Peerless Battalion’s reputation in the entire Northwest
                                            Army rose drastically. Although, at the same time, they had drawn the enmity
                                            of nearly all the other army outfits. Of course, none dared to challenge
                                            them.</p>
                                        <p>After Shen Ji spoke to him at length, the wounded Oni finally agreed to bring
                                            his Heavy Infantry Regiment to assist and cover the Peerless Battalion.
                                            Alas, Shen Ji did not know that in the near future, this ‘assistance’ would
                                            lead to his finest and most elite Regiment to be bought over y the Peerless
                                            Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji had been right about Hua Feng being sly and crafty, but he had
                                            severely underestimated the degree… especially with such a villainous
                                            advisor like Mu En by his side, that was even more so the case.</p>
                                        <p>In the end, Mu and Hong Yu had finally met up. Although Mu En had indeed
                                            ended up with two panda eyes, in the end Hong Yu had not beaten him up too
                                            brutally.</p>
                                        <p>It turned out that when they were much younger, Mu En and Hong Yu had met.
                                            Under a particular set of unique coincidences and circumstances, Mu En had
                                            accidentally been afflicted with aphrodisiac poison, and Hong Yu had
                                            sacrificed herself to save his life… thus starting the beginning of this
                                            strange romance. Mu En had not been able to accept it at first… in stories,
                                            those who met such circumstances would be saved by top beauties, yet how
                                            come his meeting had been a lady who was taller and stouter than himself!
                                            After a few days of being a groom, he had ran off.</p>
                                        <p>Who knew that by then Hong Yu was already pregnant with Crow. According to
                                            Hong Yu, the reason why Crow’s stature was shorter than herself was because
                                            Mu En was too short.</p>
                                        <p>When he had first met Crow, Mu En had felt rather awkward, turning much more
                                            honest for a time. Although he did not know that Crow was his daughter, she
                                            had evoked his memories of Hong Yu. Towards Hong Yu, he did truly feel guilt
                                            and shame.</p>
                                        <p>This time, with the entire Gold Crow Tribe here to join the Peerless
                                            Battalion, meeting Hong Yu once more, all his mixed feelings welled up
                                            within Mu En’s heart. Yet, he did not dare to tell anyone, not knowing what
                                            to do at all. At last, he still decided to sneak over and have a look at
                                            her. Who knew that it had just happened that Hong Yu was bathing at that
                                            time, and he had even got caught.</p>
                                        <p>Although they had not seen each other for years, Hong Yu still easily
                                            recognized the first and only man in her life, even if he was wearing a
                                            mask. In the end, after running for a time, Mu En was caught by Hong Yu.</p>
                                        <p>Being taught a lesson was unavoidable, but how Mu En managed to survive in
                                            the end, no one in the entire Peerless Battalion, not even the Heavenly Bow
                                            Unit members, knew. In any case, Mu En would never reveal such a thing even
                                            if he was beaten to death. Currently, Mu En was following him around
                                            everyday, as if afraid that this husband that she had finally managed to
                                            find after so long would run away again. In truth, Mu En had already
                                            accepted the fact. After all, his heart had been filled with guilt, shame
                                            and regret all these years. Meeting again after all these years, he was no
                                            longer the young man he had been then, and was much more grown up and mature
                                            now. He now had a wife, a daughter; they might be larger and more valiant
                                            than expected, but at least he had a real family.</p>
                                        <p>“Old Scoundrel, that trick of yours is really too shameless and mean.” Hua
                                            Feng looked to his side, saying exasperatedly. Mu En stood there, no longer
                                            in his mask, revealing a clean clear face, definitely not ugly at all.</p>
                                        <p>Mu En gave a humph and said: “Shameless? Mean? This is all for that precious
                                            disciple of mine. Our background and forces are just too few… since an
                                            entire Heavy Infantry Regiment is knocking on our doors, why shouldn’t we
                                            keep them?”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng’s brow furrowed and he said hesitantly: “But… in the future… can we
                                            really bring them away successfully?”</p>
                                        <p>Mu En grinned and said: “Heh, no problem… it is just ten thousand men. Don’t
                                            forget what status that little girl Fei’er is? If not for the background of
                                            the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, do you really think that little brat Weiqing
                                            can thrive and flourish so well, so easily and in such short a time?”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng smiled faintly and said: “Alright then, this matter is settled then.
                                            You take charge of it and manipulate as you require. By the way! Mu En,
                                            sister in law is still waiting for you at the door, isn’t it time for you to
                                            go back? It is getting late.”</p>
                                        <p>Instantly, Mu En’s face fell. “Boss, let me stay a while more… I’m already at
                                            such an age already, I am unable to withstand the rigours. As you know, her
                                            weight… it’s just too terrifying.”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng rolled his eyes and said: “Stupid, can’t you just be on top?”</p>
                                        <p>Mu En gave a bitter smile and said: “That doesn’t work either! As you know,
                                            the words that men hope to hear women yell out the most is ‘I want!’, but
                                            the words they fear women yelling the most is ‘I still want more!’... at her
                                            age, she is at the time of most need, especially after so many years of not
                                            meeting. Ahhh, my poor old waist!”</p>
                                        <p>“Hahahaha…” Hua Feng burst out laughing uncontrollably. Looking at Mu En’s
                                            helpless expression, he almost fell onto the ground laughing.</p>
                                        <p>“Laugh your head! If you keep provoking this old man, you just watch...one
                                            day I will slip you some of that same ‘poison’ if you are not careful, and
                                            let Shui Cao help you with that ‘antidote’. Hmph Hmph, you just wait and
                                            see!” Mu En rushed out huffily. As for whether or not his waist and back
                                            could last, or perhaps to say whether Hong Yu would pity him, that would not
                                            be known.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Fire Spirit Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>The Fire Spirit Mountain was deep in the WanShou Empire, rather close to the
                                            Ten Thousand Beast Heavens. There were basically no beastmen living within a
                                            five hundred li radius of the Fire Spirit Mountain. Although the temperature
                                            was extremely good for survival, the terrifying volcano often erupted
                                            erratically, and it had stolen the lives of many beastmen before they had
                                            given up on living there. That was the reason why that even if the WanShou
                                            Empire Royal Family did not give the order to forbid them from staying
                                            there, no one actually dared stay there. No matter how tough and physically
                                            strong the beastmen were, they could not last against the power of
                                            nature.</p>
                                        <p>A bout of green light descended from the skies, landing right at the feet of
                                            the Fire Spirit Mountain. The green light slowly dissipated, revealing two
                                            figures. It was Long Shiya and Zhou Weiqing, the teacher disciple duo.</p>
                                        <p>Two days. In just a short time of two days, they had reached this place all
                                            the way from the northern border camp. Such speed was indeed shocking.</p>
                                        <p>In these two days, Zhou Weiqing had truly enjoyed himself flying. In the
                                            process of flying, his entire body was covered by a thick layer of Wind
                                            Attribute Heavenly Energy, and with Long Shiya’s guidance, he had improved
                                            in his control over the Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy by leaps and
                                            bounds.</p>
                                        <p>Flying for such a long period of time, Zhou Weiqing was filled with such
                                            envy. Two whole days! Several thousand li distance had gone by just like
                                            that… if only he had such an ability like that too, wouldn’t that mean he
                                            could go anywhere on the entire Mainland?</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya truly lived up to his name as the First Heavenly Emperor without a
                                            Great Saint Lands background. Carrying Zhou Weiqing along as he flew for two
                                            whole days, yet Zhou Weiqing did not see any hint of fatigue on his Master’s
                                            face. This was truly a heaven defying level of power indeed!</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the Fire Spirit Mountain in front of them, it could definitely
                                            easily leave a lasting impression on anyone. Previously, he had looked at it
                                            from high above the ground, and though it was only a single mountain, it
                                            covered a massive area, and its mountainside was all a crimson red earth.
                                            Even from a distance, they had already started feeling the rolling waves of
                                            heat lashing out at them. At this time of the year, it might have not fully
                                            entered winter, but such a temperature at the north… it could only be at
                                            such a place.</p>
                                        <p>Plumes of smoke flew out constantly from the top of the Fire Spirit Mountain,
                                            even to the point that large ripples of water could be seen twisting. One
                                            could imagine the sheer temperature.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya looked toward Zhou Weiqing and said seriously: “Weiqing, this is
                                            your last chance. Think carefully now. Once you begin, there will not be any
                                            chance to stop, not even I can help in that. It will be do or die then. In
                                            truth, for myself, I do not wish for you to take such a huge risk. Training
                                            and cultivation is always the best to be done in proper order and step by
                                            step, and I know that if you do so, you will definitely surpass I, your
                                            Master, in the future…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile and said: “Master, I know that, but time
                                            waits for no man! I do not have a choice. A man can choose his actions, to
                                            sacrifice some things to accomplish others, but if I cannot even protect my
                                            own women, then what is the point of training so hard? Master, do not worry,
                                            I still have so many things to do, I will die so easily. You know how afraid
                                            of death I am, no matter how painful it is, I will not give up, how could I
                                            bear to give up!?”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya shook his head helplessly before saying: “You little brat! Alright
                                            then, since you have made your choice, let us go. Do keep in mind, as long
                                            as I am here, your life will not be in danger. No matter how much the pain
                                            is, you must endure it.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
