                                            yelled out to Shangguan Fei’er and Lin TianAo, who had been working their
                                            way towards him to gather and join forces.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er was currently extremely furious, being surrounded by the
                                            sabre formation and struck at by so many, causing even her to find it hard
                                            to cope with. After all, her own God Tier Consolidated Equipment were still
                                            not enough to cover her entire body, and though the ordinary sabres would
                                            not have any effect on her even if they landed, but there were a few
                                            powerhouses whose sabres were imbued with various Skills, that were
                                            extremely hateful.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er was after all still a young lady, and even if a single
                                            injury left a permanent mark on her body, she would not be happy about it!
                                            As such, she could only try her best to dodge or block all the attacks,
                                            before unleash bout after bout of Wind Blades from her feet to kill her
                                            opponents.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Lin TianAo turned to the side and charged
                                            towards Shangguan Fei’er. It did not take him long before he reached her
                                            side, and the Assembly Shield Set in his hands whirled about as he blocked
                                            the majority of the sabres striking out at Shangguan Fei’er. The clash of
                                            metal against metal rang out loud, but Shangguan Fei’er felt the pressure
                                            upon her lessen considerable. With Lin TianAo covering them, the two of them
                                            immediately retreated back according to Zhou Weiqing’s instructions.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing started his own series of actions. Tired from
                                            running about and having the marks of Barthez’s sneak attacks on his body,
                                            he suddenly lifted the crying-face hammer up high. The next moment, a thick
                                            layer of grey light burst forth from within, enveloping his entire body. All
                                            the incoming sabres which struck the newly formed shield of grey light just
                                            bounced off, and the sabres actually started corroding swiftly.</p>
                                        <p>Standing right in the middle of the grey shield of light, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes
                                            were serious and he focused all his attention. By now, he had sent his Ghost
                                            Demon Horse back into his Spatial Ring, afraid that his own Skill would
                                            injure it by accident. He stood there awaiting for Shangguan Fei’er and Lin
                                            TianAo to get a safe distance, while the surrounding Wolf Cavalry soldiers
                                            gathered closer, constantly attacking at him. Finally, he unleashed his
                                            attack.</p>
                                        <p>This shield of grey light was called the Ward of the Demon God, and it was
                                            another Demonic Attribute Skill that had automatically Awakened for Zhou
                                            Weiqing when he had reached the five-Jeweled stage; in a similar fashion to
                                            how his Dark Demon God Lightning had Awakened previously.</p>
                                        <p>The Ward of the Demon God was not a Fusion Skill like the Dark Demon God
                                            Lightning, purely only of the Demonic Attribute. However, once he stood in
                                            the Ward of the Demon God, the Demonic Attribute Heavenly Energy seemed to
                                            have a new and unique circulation fashion, able to Devour all the Evil,
                                            Demonic and negative emotions in the atmosphere for its own use. To use it
                                            in the middle of a battlefield could be said to be like a fish entering
                                            water, and the grievances and negative emotions of all the fresh deaths of
                                            soldiers swarmed into the grey shield of light like many rivers streaming
                                            towards the sea. The Ward of the Demon God had an extremely powerful
                                            defensive capabilities even at the start, and this increase in energy only
                                            made it stronger. Even Barthez’s sabre was not able to break through the
                                            layer of defense, not even leaving a mark.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing realised that he had Awakened a purely defensive Skill, he
                                            had been so overjoyed that tears almost streamed down his face! This could
                                            be said to be a dream Skill of his, especially given his character and how
                                            afraid of death he was. At that point, one could imagine his sheer joy and
                                            excitement. This was also the reason why he had dared to bring Shangguan
                                            Fei’er and Lin TianAo alone to invade so deeply into enemy territory.
                                            Indeed, in order to break through his current Ward of the Demon God, even
                                            for a seven or eight Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, if they did not have a
                                            God Tier Consolidated Equipment, they would not be able to do so.</p>
                                        <p>After the raised Dual Legendary Hammers released the Ward of the Demon God,
                                            in the next instant, above the Hammers a pitch black light shimmered into
                                            existence, slowly spreading outwards into a vague human shape, with three
                                            sets of wings behind its back. Although it was hazy and unclear, its basic
                                            shape was still relatively recognizable.</p>
                                        <p>The six black wings spread out slowly, and a strong and majestic aura
                                            pressured down the entire area, as if making it difficult for them to
                                            breathe.</p>
                                        <p>The senses of the war wolves were definitely much keener than their riders,
                                            and in that instance they all sensed danger, desperately attempting to
                                            retreat. However, as they were in the midst of the sabre formation, which
                                            was extremely tightly packed, how could they retreat so easily like
                                            that?</p>
                                        <p><i>What… what is that?! </i>Barthez was given a big shock. He was at the
                                            outer regions of the formation, and without hesitation he retreated. He had
                                            heard so much from his big brother about how Zhou Weiqing had used the Dark
                                            Demon God Lightning on him, and how a shadowy image had appeared then.</p>
                                        <p>Behind the six black wings of the shimmering image, a deep purple colour
                                            appeared, and the presence and pressure intensified. In that very moment, it
                                            was as if the bright sun in the sky grew dimmer.</p>
                                        <p>A thick darkness seemed to fall over them all, along with the beating of the
                                            six wings. With Zhou Weiqing in the center, the darkness spread outwards,
                                            enveloping a hundred yard radius totally.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, with Zhou Weiqing’s Five-Jeweled cultivation level, when he
                                            unleashed this Skill, it would only be a radius of fifty yards. However,
                                            with the boost from the Legendary Hammers, it allowed him to extend the
                                            radius of the Skill to affect a hundred yard radius.</p>
                                        <p>Usually, the boost of the Legendary Hammers were not as effective on the
                                            offensive power of Skills, but very effective on the lasting time or area of
                                            effect of the Skills. For example, if it were the Fetters of Wind, the boost
                                            would be on doubling the time it lasted. After all, Zhou Weiqing was still
                                            only a five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master. Of course, with the boost on the
                                            power of Skills also came the increase in drain of Heavenly Energy, though
                                            with the effect of the Dual Legendary Hammers, the gain in the effect far
                                            outweighed the increase in Energy used.</p>
                                        <p>As the black purple light flashed across, all the Wolfman Cavalry soldiers
                                            suddenly felt a terror deep in their hearts. However, they were soon
                                            surprised to realise that they were all fine after all. That dark purple
                                            light had flashed once and disappeared, as if having no effect or damage on
                                            them at all. Even the swiftly retreating Barthez started momentarily as he
                                            saw his soldiers in front were totally fine. It was clear that the Skill was
                                            different from the one his brother had described, but could it be that it
                                            was just a useless Skill that was only for scaring others? Well… the answer
                                            could only reveal itself next.</p>
                                        <p>The floor on the radius of hundred yards which the light had covered had
                                            somehow turned a dark purple colour unknowingly. The next instant, several
                                            large dark purple bubble of air rushed out from below the ground, as if
                                            there was boiling water below. The entire zone turned into a world of black
                                            and purple, and screams rang out from within. Any Wolfman Cavalry soldier
                                            enveloped by the bubbles were totally melted swiftly into a black gooey
                                            liquid before being totally swallowed up, and the bubbles continued growing,
                                            swallowing everything before them.</p>
                                        <p>All of this did not seem to happen at a very fast speed, but it was
                                            definitely an overpowering and brutal, unstoppable force. Facing such a
                                            terrifying destructive power, even some of the low ranked Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters amongst the Wolf Cavalry soldiers could not escape or hold out
                                            against it. These black-purple bubbles seemed to have a strangely powerful
                                            suction, and even if the soldiers tried to get their war wolves to bound
                                            over them to dodge it, it was a futile attempt. In the end, no matter blood,
                                            flesh or bone, all matter seemed to be dissolved within that terrifying
                                            bubble to become part of it. A thick field of negative emotions seemed to
                                            grow continually over the area, concentrating over the center where Zhou
                                            Weiqing was, causing his Ward of the Demon God to continually grow stronger.
                                            In truth, even Zhou Weiqing was startled, as he did not imagine this Skill
                                            of his would have such a terrifying effect.</p>
                                        <p>This was a Skill that he had Stored in the Heavenly Jewel Island, from a top
                                            level Heavenly Emperor stage Heavenly Beast. That Heavenly Beast was the
                                            most powerful one in the entire Heavenly Jewel Island for Darkness
                                            Attributes, at least amongst those that were open to public. Just like the
                                            Demonic Dragon Lady, a Heavenly Skill Image also appeared when he used the
                                            Skill, showing that it was as close to a Heavenly God Tier Skill as
                                            possible.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya had told Zhou Weiqing previously that although these Skills had a
                                            Heavenly Skill Image, they were not truly at the Heavenly God Tier stage
                                            yet. The difference between the two was that a true Heavenly God Tier Stage
                                            Skill’s Heavenly Skill Image would be extremely clear and distinct, and they
                                            would also change accordingly as the Skill activated.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, though Zhou Weiqing’s Skill was not truly at the Heavenly God Tier
                                            Stage, its power was terrifying enough, definitely not one to be scoffed at.
                                            Previously, the reason why Zhou Weiqing had chosen it to be his Fourth
                                            Darkness Attribute Skill was because of its mass area of effect.</p>
                                        <p>The name of this Skill was Hell’s Angel. This was Zhou Weiqing’s first time
                                            using this skill, and even he had not expected that its power would be so
                                            terrifying. Within the radius, not a single person was able to withstand the
                                            Skill. Every contact with the bubble taking a life… and the entire glowing
                                            blackish purple light seemed to denote the descent of hell on earth. The
                                            shimmering image of the Hell’s Angel Heavenly Skill Image seemed to grow
                                            thicker and more solid; at the same time Zhou Weiqing could sense his
                                            Heavenly Energy draining out of him at a shockingly rapid rate. The Hell’s
                                            Angel Skill was one that could be continually maintained, and would move
                                            along with Zhou Weiqing as he moved. That was to say, if Zhou Weiqing
                                            stepped forward, the Skill and its radius would move along with him. Of
                                            course, that was at the premise that he had sufficient Heavenly Energy to
                                            maintain it.</p>
                                        <p>After a short moment of shock, Zhou Weiqing recovered his senses. Without
                                            hesitation, he activated a Tornado Strike Skill, charging forward. In the
                                            next moment, another large bunch of Wolf Cavalry soldiers were covered
                                            within the new radius. However, after a fresh release of the bubbles, Zhou
                                            Weiqing immediately dropped the Skill. In just that short time he had held
                                            up the Skill, his entire Heavenly Energy was expended by more than sixty
                                            percent. From the start of him unleashing the Skill to dropping it, it was
                                            barely three seconds!</p>
                                        <p><i>What a shame! </i>Zhou Weiqing lamented to himself inwardly. If he had
                                            started moving the instant he activated the Hell’s Angel, perhaps he could
                                            have taken down many more wolf cavalry soldiers. Such a Skill, it was just
                                            too terrifying, not just in its effect but its toll on him! The Hell’s Angel
                                            was also one of the rare Skills that he had not gone through the Three
                                            Thousand Tempering Training, as such mass area of effect Skills did not
                                            require much fine control. Furthermore, such a Skill was just too powerful,
                                            and Zhou Weiqing could not possibly massacre everything around him when
                                            practicing it.</p>
                                        <p>From the start of Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation up until now, this was the first
                                            offensive Skill amongst all his Darkness Attribute Skills, and its power was
                                            certainly considerable… terrifying! Even though he had made some mistakes
                                            and not utilized its power to the maximum, also with some holding back due
                                            to being on a large scale battlefield… even so, just unleashing it for three
                                            seconds and moving a little, he had already caused over three hundred Wolf
                                            Cavalry soldiers and their war wolf mounts to disappear from this very
                                            world, not a remaining sign left of them! No matter how ferocious and
                                            valiant Beastmen were, they were still mortal, and subject to mortal
                                            emotion. Seeing such a terrifying sight happen right before their eyes, the
                                            surviving beastmen’s hearts were filled with fear and shock, and they backed
                                            away in panic, not even caring if them bumped into each other. In their
                                            eyes, Zhou Weiqing was no longer a human, but a devil!</p>
