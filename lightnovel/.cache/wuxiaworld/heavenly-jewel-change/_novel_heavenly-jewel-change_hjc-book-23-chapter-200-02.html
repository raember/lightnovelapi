                                            definitely the strongest amongst the three.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing her suggestions, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er were both delighted.
                                            Although their bodies currently did not have any Heavenly Energy, it should
                                            not be too tough to recover it. After all, they could still use their Saint
                                            Energy to activate their normal cultivation. Currently, all they needed was
                                            to fill themselves up once more. However, in order to preserve their
                                            sustained combat abilities, they could no longer just blindly transform
                                            everything into Saint Energy, leaving their majority Heavenly Energy to
                                            fight with, and just some Saint Energy as their trump cards.”</p>
                                        <p>In the following time, even for the Peerless Regiment warriors, Zhou Weiqing,
                                            Tian’er and Shangguan Xue’er all disappeared. No one else knew what they
                                            were doing, and it was as if they had vanished into thin air. Once in
                                            awhile, some orders would come from the governor’s mansion, and that was the
                                            only sign they were still around. However, even with Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            leadership, the current Crescent City was already in proper normal
                                            operations, as Zhou Weiqing had already passed on the temporary leadership
                                            to Lin TianAo. As for the three of them, they were currently undergoing
                                            closed door cultivation under the protective watch of Duan Tianlang.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Very soon, a month had passed. Within this month, the Crescent City had not
                                            yet been attacked by a second wave of Kalise Empire troops, and the Heavenly
                                            King assassin also hadn’t showed himself.</p>
                                        <p>On their end, Zhou Weiqing was naturally wary and afraid of this assassin.
                                            However, this assassin was no fool as well. That kick of Zhou Weiqing’s had
                                            definitely given him a lasting impression. In the end, assassins were just
                                            like a cold venomous snake, even if they had to lie in ambush and wait for a
                                            year without moving, they would do so, and not take risks where they had no
                                            confidence. Furthermore, during this period of Zhou Weiqing and the two
                                            girls were in closed door cultivation, Duan Tianlang did not hide his
                                            Heavenly King stage aura at all.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s weird powers, along with Tian’er and Shangguan Xue’er who had
                                            certainly surprised him, and the unknown Heavenly King Stage powerhouse
                                            (Duan Tianlang)... such a formation staying together, even if this Heavenly
                                            King assassin was the top assassin in the world, he dared not act rashly. Of
                                            course, during this month, he had also spent most of it healing and
                                            recuperating. Currently, he was silently hiding nearby, waiting for another
                                            perfect time to strike.</p>
                                        <p>This month was not just silent for the Crescent City. The rest of the entire
                                            Mainland was also extremely silent, the various large Empires not showing
                                            any movement. The Kalise Empire also did not show any large movements.
                                            According to Kou Rui and his scouts, the Kalise Empire had already stationed
                                            another large troop of armies in another city that originally belonged to
                                            the Heavenly Bow Empire, the closest one to the Crescent City about three
                                            hundred li away. However, there were currently no signs that they were about
                                            to move out.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, Kou Rui, who had been left in charge of scouting and
                                            general information gathering, had strengthened their checks at the city
                                            gates of the Crescent City, and they had already caught several dozen
                                            spies.</p>
                                        <p>Conscription of soldiers was perhaps the most troublesome job, and currently
                                            Yan Zhexi was in charge of it. As the Fei Li Empire sent the first batch of
                                            supplies as well as a troop of five thousand logistics personnel, the
                                            critical state their forces had been in was at least solved. Currently,
                                            besides the requisite training they did everyday, the Peerless Regiment
                                            soldiers would undergo some patrolling investigations or interrogation
                                            missions.</p>
                                        <p>In the hidden room where they were cultivating.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing slowly opened his eyes. Instantly, it was as if two cold bolts
                                            of lightning pierced through the room, filling it with a strange aura.</p>
                                        <p>As he opened his eyes, Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er each at his side
                                            respectively also opened their eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s face had a faint blush on her face, and as she looked at
                                            Zhou Weiqing, she turned her head around. On the other hand, Tian’er was
                                            smiling happily as she said: “We did it! An entire month, but it was truly
                                            worth it. Our Heavenly Energy has finally recovered to our original
                                            standards. This cultivating of the Saint Energy is truly not easy at
                                            all.”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, they had used an entire month to transform the cultivated Saint
                                            Energy back to their Heavenly Energy, resuming their usual strength.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, this entire month could be said to be extremely dangerous for Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s trio. If the Heavenly King assassin had snuck in secretly, perhaps
                                            he would have had a great chance. Of course, that was no certainty as well,
                                            even without their Heavenly Energy, their Saint Energy was not to be
                                            underestimated. The instant explosive power was more than enough to shock
                                            even the Heavenly King stage powerhouse Duan Tianlang.</p>
                                        <p>This Saint Energy was truly one of a kind. However, at this moment, it was
                                            not just Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er who had it, even Shangguan Xue’er had it
                                            now.</p>
                                        <p>According to Zhou Weiqing’s hypothesis previously, Shangguan Xue’er’s
                                            Heavenly Energy had been fully transformed to Saint Energy after he combined
                                            forces with Tian’er. In this month, Shangguan Xue’er had joined them in the
                                            process of recovering her Heavenly Energy. The reason she blushed upon
                                            seeing Zhou Weiqing just now was because during the transformation process
                                            of the Saint Energy, she had been kissed by him so many times. Towards such
                                            a method of using their mouths to infuse the Saint Energy, our dear
                                            shameless Little Fatty was more than happy to enjoy it.</p>
                                        <p>However, during the process of transformation, Zhou Weiqing also discovered
                                            that for Shangguan Xue’er without her own Saint Attributes, they actually
                                            had to spend more energy to refine and transform into the Saint energy. As
                                            such, she actually had less Saint Energy than Zhou Weiqing or Tian’er. This
                                            was even after the fact that she was at a higher cultivation level than the
                                            two of them, and the Boundless Infinitum Technique was known for its thick
                                            and stable Heavenly Energy. Do not forget that Shangguan Xue’er also had the
                                            Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewel, and though it was not as monstrous as
                                            his six Attributes, she still had four Attributes!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had done a simple calculation. If an ordinary Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master were to fully transform their Heavenly Energy, assuming he was at the
                                            same level as them, being able to have four to five drops would likely be
                                            the norm.</p>
                                        <p>Also, after their investigations and calculation, they estimated that if they
                                            wanted to fill their entire bodies with the Saint Energy, it was definitely
                                            a long road ahead of them, as it would likely take them around three
                                            thousand drops to complete the entire process.</p>
                                        <p>However, in this month, they did not just simply spend it recovering their
                                            old Heavenly Energy. Besides the fact that all their cultivation had
                                            improved, strengthening the overall amount of Heavenly Energy. In terms of
                                            controlling the Saint Energy and finding a balance, they had also discovered
                                            several tricks.</p>
                                        <p>For example, with all three of them, it was no longer just a simple matter of
                                            ‘storing’ the Saint Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Although none of them had all four Saint Attributes individually, the Saint
                                            Energy itself was consisting of all four Saint Attributes! As such, after
                                            much experimentation and testing, they were able to form a very tiny
                                            whirlpool of Saint Energy in their bodies, silently spinning away. This
                                            whirlpool was actually modelled after the original energy whirlpool that
                                            formed in Zhou Weiqing’s body after he joined hands with Tian’er and their
                                            four Saint Attributes actually fused together.</p>
                                        <p>Do not underestimate this tiny whirlpool within their bodies. In fact, it
                                            could be said that the majority of the time and efforts of this entire month
                                            was spent developing this one thing, and it was also their greatest
                                            progress. With this tiny whirlpool in their bodies, they no longer needed to
                                            worry about permanently using up their Saint Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Unlike the original fused one, this whirlpool would not automatically refine
                                            and transform their Heavenly Energy, only maintaining its own form and the
                                            Saint Energy within. However, once they circulated and started using their
                                            Saint Energy, as long as this whirlpool existed, the Saint Energy would
                                            slowly recover and not be used up totally like in their first few tries.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had tested the limits of this many times. Any Saint Energy he
                                            used up would be slowly recovered at the rate of about one drop per day.
                                            However, there was also a caveat for that. The tiny whirlpool could only be
                                            maintained with at least ten drops of Saint Energy, and Zhou Weiqing called
                                            it the base requisite amount. That was to say, unless Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Tian’er joined forces to ensure their Saint Attributes fused again,
                                            otherwise if any of the three used their Saint Energy individually, they had
                                            to hold back half of it to maintain the whirlpool.</p>
                                        <p>In this month, with the sheer amount of talent between the three of them, and
                                            their cultivation speeds, they had only just recovered their Heavenly Energy
                                            and only improved slightly in that sense. However, all three of them felt as
                                            if they had been fully reborn and remoulded. That was because they truly had
                                            a new power within them, the true profound secrets of the four Saint
                                            Attributes!</p>
                                        <p>This was especially so for Shangguan Xue’er. In truth, she felt a great sense
                                            of gratitude towards Tian’er, though she might not show it externally. After
                                            all, according to normal circumstances, it would have been impossible for
                                            her to have this Saint Energy. However, Tian’er’s generosity greatly touched
                                            Shangguan Xue’er. The conflict between the two had long disappeared, and
                                            their relationship had improved dramatically. Many times during breaks of
                                            their cultivation, Zhou Weiqing would joke that this was actually his
                                            greatest reward in the entire month.</p>
                                        <p>Stretching his arms and doing a few simple exercises, Zhou Weiqing grinned
                                            and said: “Heh heh, now, if that bastard really comes, he will not have the
                                            chance to easily kill me anymore. With the current Saint Energy I have, I
                                            can at least ensure he will not be able to kill me within ten seconds. With
                                            this time, we should be better be able to deal with him.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er giggled and said: “Now, I am actually thinking that perhaps the best
                                            cultivation method for us is to return to the WanShou Empire. As long as we
                                            have enough Heavenly Beasts to let us Devour… Heh heh, our Saint Energy can
                                            increase quickly. At least, it will be faster than if we cultivate it
                                            ourselves. Once we can fill our entire bodies with Saint Energy, to
                                            consolidate our Heavenly Core Nucleus, then we will be the strongest
                                            Heavenly King powerhouses in the entire world. At that point, I think that
                                            we can even stand up to ordinary Heavenly Emperors.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “How can it be so easy to consolidate and form
                                            the Heavenly Core Nucleus? Each of us needs at least three thousand drops of
                                            the Saint Energy, how many Heavenly Beasts would that take? Furthermore,
                                            those Heavenly Beasts aren’t going to stand there quietly to let us Devour
                                            them.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er stuck her tongue out at him and said: “However, Weiqing, you must
                                            promise me one thing. Even if we use the Devour Skill on Heavenly Beasts to
                                            help our cultivation, we must not kill or severely injure them. I know that
                                            your Devour Skill also Devours life force, and in doing so the speed of
                                            cultivation is much faster. However, unnecessary killing is also acting
                                            against the heavens, we cannot kill large numbers of Heavenly Beasts for
                                            selfish reasons. Otherwise, I will not be able to accept it.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Don’t worry, I never planned to go
                                            kill Heavenly Beasts. After all, my wife is the King of the Beasts right?
                                            Furthermore, if we just depend on killing for our cultivation, it will
                                            definitely leave a shadow in our hearts. It will actually be a detriment to
                                            us in the long term and possibly limit our potential.”</p>
