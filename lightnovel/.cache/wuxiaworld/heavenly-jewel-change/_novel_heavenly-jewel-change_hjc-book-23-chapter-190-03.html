                                            Energy was almost used up more than seventy percent, the opportunity had
                                            finally arrived. In his eyes, though Zhou Weiqing was currently in an
                                            advantageous position, but for a six-Jeweled stage Heavenly Jewel Master to
                                            continuously attack for so long, his Heavenly Energy should be drained as
                                            much or even more than his own. He might have been humiliated previously,
                                            but the chance for winning had come!</p>
                                        <p>In fact, as Shen Wang felt the pressure upon him lessen, it was because all
                                            the lightning pearls attacking him had stopped for a moment. However, a
                                            temporary stop did not mean that they had disappeared.</p>
                                        <p>The current Dragon Silencing Seal timing was one minute, and towards such a
                                            timing, how could Zhou Weiqing make a mistake?</p>
                                        <p>Hope had just sparked in Shen Wang, but when he saw the sight before him, his
                                            heart sank in despair.</p>
                                        <p>The halt of attacks from the lightning pearls was because they were actually
                                            gathering together, pressing close to each other. In that short period of
                                            time, another several hundred lightning pearls had coalesced into existence.
                                            This time, as compared to all the previous attacks, all the lightning pearls
                                            swarmed together as one, striking out at every single portion of his body at
                                            once in a final simultaneous strike.</p>
                                        <p>Another massive explosion. Shen Wang’s body shuddered violently, and turned a
                                            burned charcoal black. Originally, the beautiful silver armour had been kept
                                            when he had released his Consolidated Equipment, and he hadn’t had the time
                                            to wear it back. Currently, his clothes were pretty much in shreds, and his
                                            beautiful locks of golden hair were all frizzled and burned. In the mass of
                                            explosions, he was blown back almost five metres before landing heavily on
                                            the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not continue attacking, twirling the Dual Legendary Hammers
                                            in his hands before turning in a suave, smooth motion. Acting cool indeed!
                                            [1. I can’t help but be reminded of this - <a
                                                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqz5dbs5zmo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqz5dbs5zmo</a>]
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Compared to Zhou Weiqing’s acting cool, currently Princess Cai Cai’s
                                            expression was very interesting. She was not vexed or depressed at all; she
                                            was not that shallow, and this minor setback was nothing in her eyes.
                                            Instead, what were in her eyes was pure shock. Indeed, utter shock.</p>
                                        <p>Nine Jewels versus Six Jewels, yet it was as if he he did not have a chance
                                            at all, losing before he could even display his own strength. It was truly a
                                            tragic loss, not even able to force his opponent to take a single step. What
                                            kind of power gap was that?</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was feeling his own ‘Flying Lightning God Technique’ more and
                                            more, especially as he grew more familiar with using it in combat. Ever
                                            since he fought with Shangguan Xue’er, the more he liked the idea of
                                            focusing on training a Skill to the utmost. With his Six Ultimate Godly
                                            Light Formation, he could easily mimic any Skill and transmute energy
                                            between each Heavenly Energy Attribute. However, each and every Attribute
                                            has its own unique characteristics, and there are definitely differences in
                                            manipulating them well. In order to boost his current combat ability, to
                                            improve his current control, Zhou Weiqing decided to temporarily give up
                                            practicing his control of the other five Attributes while in the Six
                                            Ultimate Godly Light Formation, fully concentrating on the ‘Flying Lightning
                                            God Technique’.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, he had already been on this path even before fighting against
                                            Shangguan Xue’er, but it had just affirmed his notions. After all, even if
                                            in the future he had more Heavenly Energy to start Fusing his own
                                            multiple-Attribute Skills, by training his control of the ‘Flying Lightning
                                            God Technique’, it would also help in his future control (as long as
                                            Lightning was part of the Fusion).</p>
                                        <p>The silence was deafening. Perhaps more accurately, the entire audience was
                                            dumbfounded, especially the group of Fei Li officials who were staring with
                                            their jaws agape.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing walked slowly towards Shen Wang who was lying on the ground. At
                                            that moment, Cai Cai’s voice rang out urgently: “Commander Zhou, please
                                            spare him.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing lifted his head to look at Cai Cai on the VIP stage before
                                            smiling as he said: “Your Highness, please do not worry. Since I have
                                            already agreed it is just a duel, I naturally will not kill him.
                                            Furthermore, I am still waiting for his apology. Tian’er.”</p>
                                        <p>Instantly, Tian’er understood what he meant, and a faint gold light shimmered
                                            around her hands. From her seat to where Shen Wang was lying, it was at
                                            least forty yards away, but the gold light just flew across without any
                                            problems, landing accurately upon him. A thick divine aura formed a circle
                                            of light around Shen Wang’s body, and his unconscious body started twitching
                                            before he actually roused up.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Wang was after all a nine-Jeweled Upper level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master. Although his defenses had been breached and overwhelmed by the mass
                                            explosions of numerous lightning pearls, his inner muscles, bones were all
                                            sturdy, and his injuries were not too deep. It was just that his Heaenly
                                            Energy had all been used up, and he was unable to continue fighting any
                                            longer.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he woke up, Shen Wang immediately saw Zhou Weiqing standing right
                                            in front of him.</p>
                                        <p>*Waah* Shen Wang vomited out a mouthful of blood; not because of any injury,
                                            but because he was totally ashamed and embarrassed, wishing a pit would open
                                            in the ground and swallow him up.</p>
                                        <p>In front of his goddess that he secretly loved, in front of all those
                                            officials, even in front of so many of his subordinates… he had actually
                                            lost to Zhou Weiqing, a mere six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master. More so, he
                                            had lost so terribly, his opponent not even moving a step before winning.
                                            The word ‘shame’ was not enough to describe his current feelings.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not say a word, instead pointing to the flag behind him
                                            before looking at Shen Wang. His meaning was clear - ‘You have lost, please
                                            fulfill your promise.’</p>
                                        <p>Shen Wang grit his teeth, enduring the massive pain on his body as he slowly
                                            stood up, looking at Zhou Weiqing as his face twitched. Finally, he sighed,
                                            lifting his right hand, gathering the final remnants of his Heavenly Energy
                                            into his palm, and in a lightning strike his palm slammed towards his own
                                            head.</p>
                                        <p>As the Vice Commander of the Royal Family Cavalry troop, he represented the
                                            honour and dignity of his own Fei Li Empire. If he were to kneel and kowtow
                                            to the Heavenly Bow Empire flag like in the bet, it would not just be a mere
                                            representation of himself, but the entire Fei Li Empire. As such, he would
                                            rather choose to die for his Empire than to kneel.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, Shen Wang’s body froze in place. His hand had already
                                            reached his head, but did not manage to land finally. He heard Zhou Weiqing
                                            laughing at the side before he said: “Bro Shen is a staunch man with strong
                                            morals indeed, a man of sentiment and emotions.”</p>
                                        <p>“However, it is not necessary to die for your Empire. After all, our Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire is still a friendly ally of the Fei Li Empire, it was only
                                            because Bro Shen insulted my Empire earlier that I had no choice but to
                                            fight for honour. Regarding the bet, let us call it off, but I hope that Bro
                                            Shen can please choose your words carefully next time.” Zhou Weiqing said
                                            generously as he pulled Shen Wang’s hand away from his own head; at the same
                                            time, he used the Devour Skill to drain away the last bit of Heavenly
                                            Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Wang couldn’t help but clench his teeth as he looked at Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            smiling face. That fellow had acted as both the bad guy, then the good guy.
                                            Now, it even seemed as if he was the one who caused trouble, and Zhou
                                            Weiqing was the generous fellow who forgave him!</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Cai Cai had already personally come down from the VIP Stand,
                                            leading the group of officials to quickly come before Zhou Weiqing.
                                            Currently, her expression resumed its usual calm; not only was she not
                                            angry, she had a look of gratitude on her face. Smiling gently at Zhou
                                            Weiqing, she said: “Many thanks to Commander Zhou for showing mercy. We have
                                            indeed lost this round, and I represent General Shen to apologise for his
                                            previous remarks to your Empire.” As she said that, she bowed slightly
                                            towards the Heavenly Bow Empire flag.</p>
                                        <p>“Your Highness!” Shen Wang knelt down in a loud thudding sound before Cai
                                            Cai, his face filled with shame.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai laughed heartily, supporting him up as she said: “General, your loss
                                            is not because of your own cultivation level. Please do not make light of
                                            your own life in the future, our Empire still needs to depend on General to
                                            defend us.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was standing opposite Cai Cai, and as he looked at this
                                            Princess, he couldn’t help but feel his heart grip tightly. With just a few
                                            simple words, Cai Cai had totally reversed the terrible situation that they
                                            had been in. Not only did she not lose any pride from this, she showed the
                                            generosity of an Empire, also sealing any other possible avenues for Zhou
                                            Weiqing to continue on those lines. More so, she had taken the opportunity
                                            to further affirm Shen Wang’s loyalty. It could be said that she had killed
                                            many birds with a single stone!</p>
                                        <p>As expected, Shen Wang’s face was filled with gratitude, his gaze towards Cai
                                            Cai almost fanatic, as if he would be willing to die for her anytime.</p>
                                        <p><i>Princess Cai Cai, she is truly formidable indeed! </i>Zhou Weiqing
                                            couldn’t help but praise her in his heart, but also felt wary at the same
                                            time.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Wang retreated to the side, and Cai Cai’s gaze naturally landed upon
                                            Zhou Weiqing as she said in praise: “I never expected that Commander Zhou
                                            would give me such a good surprise after more than a year. Today, we have
                                            been rash and hasty indeed. Well, would Commander Zhou be interested in
                                            making a bet with me?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily. All along, it had always been him asking
                                            others to bet with him, and this time, Cai Cai was actually the one to take
                                            the initiative to do so. Along with Cai Cai’s previous series of actions, he
                                            couldn’t help but be on the guard.</p>
                                        <p>“Your Highness, what kind of bet are you looking to make?”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai smiled faintly and said: “No matter the relationship between humans
                                            or between Empires, power has always been an important factor. How about our
                                            two Empires hold a simple friendly competition, five rounds, and whoever
                                            wins three rounds will be the victor. Just now, that would be considered the
                                            first round, and you have won. If in the end, the victor is the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire, then I will immediately return to the Palace and request for His
                                            Majesty to receive your Empire’s diplomatic party with the highest honours.
                                            However, if we are lucky enough to win, then I would invite Commander Zhou
                                            to take the difficult task of inviting Princess Difuya to enter the Fei Li
                                            City together with me. Commander Zhou, what do you think?”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai’s words were indeed skillful. On the surface, to the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire, no matter winning or losing, there was no actual loss to them. If
                                            they won, they could even gain more honour, and even if they lost, it didn’t
                                            seem like any big loss. This bet fully displayed Cai Cai’s generosity and
                                            the grand display of the Fei Li Empire as one of the great Empires.</p>
                                        <p>However, in truth, if they really lost this bet, then in this diplomatic
                                            visit and in the upcoming negotiations, the Heavenly Bow Empire would be at
                                            a big disadvantage. In such a case, no matter what Cai Cai was discussing
                                            with Zhou Weiqing, she would be able to play a leading role. At the same
                                            time, she was able to use this ‘three out of five’ competition to erase the
                                            dejected feelings that any of their side might be feeling, and seize the
                                            opportunity to suppress the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing asked impassively: “What, and how, would the next four rounds be
                                            then, Your Highness?”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai laughed heartily and said: “Very simple, the current round’s losing
                                            side will propose the next round’s competing rules, so on so forth, until
                                            one side wins three.”</p>
                                        <p>If not for the current subtle and tricky relations between both sides, Zhou
                                            Weiqing really wanted to give Cai Cai a big thumbs up. She was truly
                                            impressive! With just a few words, not only did she turn a disadvantageous
                                            situation into a strong opportunity for her side to gain the advantage,
                                            greatly lowering the victory gains that Zhou Weiqing had already won. This
                                            Princess Cai Cai was extraordinary indeed, no wonder she had risen to her
                                            status and rank from the rest of the Royal Family.</p>
                                        <p>After a moment of thought, Zhou Weiqing nodded, Smiling at Cai Cai, he said:
                                            “Very well, as Your Highness says. Please set our next round topic
                                            then.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
