                                            shockwave through the Royal Family of the Fei Li Empire… so I guess… Can you
                                            tell me about it now?”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai nodded, saying: “Not long ago, Ye Paopao rushed back and informed us
                                            regarding your efforts and results in this year’s Heavenly Jewel Tournament.
                                            Without question, by defeating and killing the Bai Da Battle Team, beating
                                            the Dan Dun Empire and even gaining the final champion, you all are heroes
                                            of the Empire. Such an honour, no one has ever gained before. His Majesty
                                            was overjoyed, and wanted to confer a noble title to all of you, granting
                                            each of you the greatest honours. After all, you all have brought back the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Plaque and also brought much honour to the Empire. It could
                                            be said that in the entire history of the Fei Li Empire, no one has ever
                                            done anything that could match your accomplishments. Indeed, if you were not
                                            in the Fei Li Battle Team, this would have happened… Alas, when the Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire was suddenly destroyed, it caused much trouble…”</p>
                                        <p>“You are the son of Admiral Zhou from the Heavenly Bow Empire, and more so
                                            you have proven your outstanding talent during the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament. If our Fei Li Empire gives you a huge reward, then your draw and
                                            appeal will reach a terrifying state. When the Heavenly Bow Empire was
                                            destroyed… our Empire had decided to guard our own borders and not counter
                                            attack the Bai Dai Empire… Do you understand what I mean?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyes turned cold, and he slowly nodded, saying: “So… that is
                                            to say… the Fei Li Royal Family is afraid that I will have a bad effect on
                                            the Fei Li Empire, and for the sake of revenge, draw too many of their
                                            talents right?”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai smiled bitterly and sighed, before nodding as she said: “Yes, that is
                                            the gist of the matter. Because of this matter, the Royal Family has been
                                            embroiled in a massive debate. A portion thinks that you have already done
                                            so much for our Empire, and you have to be rewarded. However, another
                                            portion things that if you continue staying in the Academy, learning too
                                            much and perhaps enter our Fei Li Empire Army, it will have severe
                                            repercussions for us in the future. You are after all not a Fei Li Empire
                                            citizen…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled passively. Towards all of that, he did not want to argue.
                                            The moment he had heard the news regarding his father and that he was still
                                            alive, his heart had already brightened.</p>
                                        <p>“That is alright, Principal Cai Cai, just tell me the result, I can accept
                                            it.”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai said: “The final result of all the debate was… two choices for you…
                                            Firstly, you proclaim to the world that you have left the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire and joined our Fei Li Empire as a citizen. Your reward for the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament will be given out to you, but you must leave the
                                            Academy, and also will never be able to join the Army. The second choice… is
                                            you do not join our Empire as a citizen, you will get a million gold coins,
                                            but you must also leave the Academy.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled passively and said: “I am only seventeen years old this
                                            year, is it necessary for the Fei Li Empire to be so nervous? Ally… this is
                                            our Heavenly Bow Empire’s Ally…”</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai lowered her head in shame. “I’m sorry Weiqing. Each Empire has their
                                            own troubles… The WanShou Empire border has much conflict, and their armies
                                            have been attacking in greater strength this year. We just do not have the
                                            resources and manpower to counter attack the Bai Da Empire, and we can only
                                            guard ourselves against them. This is also the reason why they have been so
                                            daring as to attack your Heavenly Bow Empire… they have exactly seen that
                                            happening and seized the opportunity. In the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, you
                                            may have created many miracles, but at the same time, you also offended the
                                            Blood Red Hell…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood up and said: “Principal, I understand, you do not need to
                                            say anymore. I will leave the Academy. In a while, I will bid farewell to my
                                            classmates, then I will leave. I will never give up my own nationality, even
                                            if my Empire is already gone for now. As for that million gold coins, it is
                                            not necessary. However, please help me inform the Royal Family that from
                                            today onwards, our Heavenly Bow Empire will no longer be allies to the Fei
                                            Li Empire.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, he pulled up Dou Dou, who had been listening at the side,
                                            confused. Turning around, he walked out of the office.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai looked at Zhou Weiqing’s disappearing back and couldn’t help but
                                            sigh. She did not tell Zhou Weiqing that she had fought so hard for him, and
                                            this was the best she could do. In the Fei Li Empire, there were actually
                                            many who were against him, with a few even wanting to imprison him or kill
                                            him, to prevent any future problems.</p>
                                        <p>Regarding Zhou Weiqing, Cai Cai knew that deep within, she admitted to
                                            herself that she could not read this young man. She did not know exactly how
                                            far he could go in the future, but she knew it would be far indeed. Alas, no
                                            matter what, she was just a woman. Despite all her talents, she did not have
                                            a status that matched it in the Fei Li Empire, especially regarding the
                                            policy decisions of the Empire; she was just not given a say, and it was all
                                            she could do to influence it as best she could. And now, all she could do
                                            was stand there and watch as a young man with unlimited potential be given
                                            up just like that, just for the short sighted, short term gain of the
                                            Empire.</p>
                                        <p>To give up on Zhou Weiqing, it would seem to be of great benefit to the Fei
                                            Li Empire now. First, and perhaps most importantly, it would get the Blood
                                            Red Hell off their backs. Next, they would not need to worry that Zhou
                                            Weiqing would grow in influence within the Fei Li Empire, and perhaps have a
                                            negative impact on them in the future. If Zhou Weiqing was just an ordinary
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master, perhaps they would not care so much, no matter how
                                            powerful he grew. Alas, he was not of ordinary background. As the son of
                                            Admiral Zhou, it was without question that he would step on the path of
                                            revenge.</p>
                                        <p>What Zhou Weiqing did not know was that one of the main reasons why the Fei
                                            Li Empire had finally gone on this path in treating him like this was
                                            because of Ye Paopao’s father, the Premier of the Empire. Indeed, it was he
                                            who had been a greatest influence in having this decision set in stone. That
                                            was also because Ye Paopao had been by Zhou Weiqing’s side for so long, and
                                            he was quite familiar with his character. It was he who had described the
                                            possible threat Zhou Weiqing might pose to his father.</p>
                                        <p>Without a doubt, Ye Paopao admired, even respected Zhou Weiqing. However,
                                            with the interests of his Empire in mind, and perhaps more so because of
                                            that ugly jealousy in his heart, he had finally chosen to describe Zhou
                                            Weiqing as a threat.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai did not tell Zhou Weiqing all of that, as she was hoping that he
                                            would not regard the Fei Li Empire as an enemy. Alas, from the way things
                                            were going, her hopes were just too naive on her part.</p>
                                        <p>Cai Cai did not blame Zhou Weiqing for making such a decision. If it had been
                                            her, she might not been able to remain as calm as him.</p>
                                        <p>As he walked out of the office, a cold smile touched the lips of Zhou
                                            Weiqing. <i>Fei Li Empire, very good indeed, Fei Li Empire!</i></p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing was not disappointed. That was because, on their way
                                            back to the Fei Li Empire, he had already lost hope in them.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Bow Empire had been invaded by the combined armies of the Kalise
                                            and Bai Da Empire for so long, if the Fei Li Empire had truly wanted to help
                                            the Heavenly Bow Empire, they would have started taken action long ago.
                                            However, they did not even seem to have the intention of moving at all.</p>
                                        <p><i>So what if I do not have the help of the Fei Li Empire? </i>In fact, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had never planned to stay on at the Fei Li Military Academy, and his
                                            current feelings were not disappointed at all. On the contrary, he was
                                            overjoyed; hearing that the Heavenly Bow Palace was still intact, his
                                            father, godfather, and possibly his mother all still alive. There was still
                                            hope for the Heavenly Bow Empire, and at least, there was still a hundred
                                            metre radius of land that was still, in name, under the Heavenly Bow Empire.
                                            To Zhou Weiqing, this was enough.</p>
                                        <p>Pulling Dou Dou along with him back down the stairs, Zhou Weiqing soon
                                            reached the Commoner Class One’s classroom. Although Cai Cai did not say
                                            much, he could easily guess that since the Fei Li Empire did not welcome him
                                            any longer, it would be best for him to leave as quickly as possible.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing entered the Commoner Class One, he saw that besides his
                                            entire class and Ming Hua, there were two others in the room as well. The
                                            first was Yun Li, his Lifetime Follower that had entered the school as a
                                            temporary teacher, and the other was the leader of the senior classes, Zang
                                            Lang.</p>
                                        <p>When they had heard that Zhou Weiqing had returned, these two had rushed to
                                            find him as soon as they could.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing bade Dou Dou to sit at his original seat, and he walked up to
                                            the teaching platform at the front of the class, ignoring Ming Hua who had
                                            been standing there.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua was speechless with anger, but she could not say anything at that
                                            point. With a humph, she backed to the side to stand together with Yun
                                            Li.</p>
                                        <p>Behind the podium, Zhou Weiqing looked down to see a sea of heated gazes
                                            looking excitedly at him. All of a sudden, Zhou Weiqing bowed down in a
                                            ninety degree angle towards all his classmates.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, what are you doing?” All of the students were shocked, and Kou Rui
                                            couldn’t help but jump up and exclaim loudly. The rest of the students also
                                            stood up.</p>
                                        <p>“Everyone, sit down…” Zhou Weiqing stood up straight once more, and said
                                            solemnly.</p>
                                        <p>What was prestige and status? At this moment, Zhou Weiqing’s status truly
                                            showed itself. All the students who had stood up sat down, and the entire
                                            class fell into silence.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing sighed and said: “I bowed to everyone because I have to
                                            apologise to all of you. I’m afraid that I will not be able to fulfil my
                                            previous promise to you all. In a moment, I will be leaving the Academy, and
                                            I’m afraid I can no longer study with all of you again. I will leave a sum
                                            of money behind, and if you all scrimp and do not waste it, it should be
                                            enough for most of your Consolidating and Skill Storing needs. I’m sorry,
                                            all of you.”</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, you… you are leaving?” This time, even the normally quiet Yan Zhexi
                                            exclaimed urgently, and the rest of the students also showed a shocked look
                                            on their faces.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “I’m sure you have all heard… my homeland… the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire has been invaded and conquered by the Kalise and Bai Da
                                            Empire. The Fei Li Empire has already decided not to counter attack on our
                                            behalf, and have also forbidden me to continue studying here in the Academy.
                                            As such, I can only leave. There is nothing much else to say, but no matter
                                            what, you will all still be my good brothers. At least, we have all sat in
                                            the same classroom, and studied together before. Please do not forget what I
                                            have said to you all, although we are commoners, but we need to stand up
                                            straight. I cannot bear to leave you all, but this is a path I have to take.
                                            I hope that in the future, I will be able to meet with you and fight with
                                            you all together on the battlefield. Zhexi, come here…”</p>
                                        <p>Yan Zhexi walked up the Zhou Weiqing, still in a daze.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, clapping on the shoulders as he said: “It looks
                                            like in the few months I have gone, you have done a good job in leading the
                                            rest, and everyone is able to accept you. In that case, once I leave, you
                                            will be the class leader of our Commoner Class One. Do not forget our
                                            legacy, unity is strength. As long as you all work together as one, no one
                                            can bully us. Here, this card has ten million gold coins stored within, and
                                            it is all I can leave for you all. Although I can no longer fulfil my full
                                            promise, and cannot continue creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for
                                            you all, but at least I can do this much. I trust that you will use this
                                            wisely for everyone…”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing shoved the card that he had prepared into Yan
                                            Zhexi’s hands. Once more, he swept his gaze around to look at all his
                                            erstwhile classmates. Taking a deep breath, he spun around to take his
                                            leave.</p>
                                        <p></p>
