                                            Although he had found it hard to accept Crow’s size, but to null a wedding
                                            agreement was not something he would do. Firstly, this was a serious matter
                                            which was not just personal, but to do with the relations between both their
                                            tribes. More importantly, he also knew that once a Gold Crow Tribe female
                                            had her marriage nulled, then it was a serious matter. The Tribe Rules of
                                            the Gold Crow Tribe was that no matter what the reason, a woman who had her
                                            marriage nulled was considered a disloyal woman. Not only would Crow no
                                            longer be able to remain the heir of the Gold Crow Tribe Chieftain, her life
                                            might even be in danger. Although Ma Qun did not think of himself as a good
                                            person, he could not possibly destroy a young woman’s life like that! That
                                            was also the reason why he ran away previously instead of nulling the
                                            marriage agreement.</p>
                                        <p>Crow looked at him coldly before saying: “Why not? Since you do not like me,
                                            I’ll give you back your freedom.”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun shook his head, his heart thinking back to the third step that Zhou
                                            Weiqing had told him. Previously, he had still been a little hesitant, but
                                            now he knew he could no longer hesitate any longer.</p>
                                        <p>“Crow, originally when I ran away, the mistake was mine. At that time, I did
                                            not think clearly, and I did not want to get married at all, and I hated the
                                            thought of being forced into one by the order of the tribes. However, since
                                            that time, I have already thought things through clearly; no matter you or
                                            me, we have a heavy weight on our shoulders, a responsibility. This has been
                                            more and more clear to me after entering the outside world, seeing how the
                                            human Heavenly Jewel Masters have such power, and I truly hate myself for my
                                            laziness and uselessness in the past. I am starting to work hard now,
                                            cultivate hard. In truth, I had already planned to complete my training
                                            first, at least to be at the same level as you before returning to look for
                                            you. No matter what… I need to be at least equal to my own woman…”</p>
                                        <p>“Earlier, in that instant when I saw you, I was so ashamed that I could not
                                            face anyone, and was wishing that the very earth would swallow me up. I know
                                            that you Gold Crow Tribe members will not leave your home so easily, and I
                                            cannot think of another reason for you to be here besides looking for me.
                                            For a young lady like you to leave home alone and travel so far, I am really
                                            touched.”</p>
                                        <p>“To the mistake that I have made back then, I really do not know how to make
                                            it up to you. I just wish that I had the chance to understand you, to make
                                            it up to you, to love and cherish you…”</p>
                                        <p>As he spoke up to this point, Ma Qun gave a sad, bitter smile, before
                                            continuing: “Of course, I know that one has to pay for their mistakes. If
                                            you do not want to give me that chance, I will understand it, but at least
                                            let me protect your name and purity, that is the best way for me to pay for
                                            my sins.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, Ma Qun lifted his right hand. No one knew when a short
                                            dagger had appeared in his hands, and without hesitation, he stabbed it down
                                            savagely towards the left portion of his chest.</p>
                                        <p>The words that Ma Qun had spoken was truly from his heart, and the third step
                                            that Zhou Weiqing had taught him was called the Self-Torture Trick.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had told him that if Crow did not hit him after entering the
                                            room, that meant she had some feelings for him. If that was so, he could
                                            make use of the Self-Torture Trick to make things up with her. However,
                                            whether or not he decided to use it would be up to him.</p>
                                        <p>When Ma Qun had spoken those words to her, he was suddenly enveloped by a
                                            sense of sorrow and regret. Looking at the tearing Crow, his Self-Torture
                                            Trick suddenly morphed from an act to a reality. Zhou Weiqing had originally
                                            told him to stab down in the right side of his chest, as that would be a
                                            serious injury but not fatal. However, he had actually stabbed down on the
                                            left side, where the heart was.</p>
                                        <p>To the Gold Crow Tribe, if a woman’s husband passed away, that would not
                                            affect a woman’s reputation, and she could remarry. In doing so now, Ma Qun
                                            was offering his own life as a price to redeem Crow’s reputation.</p>
                                        <p>“What are you doing?!” Seeing Ma Qun stab down unhesitatingly with his
                                            dagger, Crow’s heart melted. Her hands lifted up swiftly, grabbing onto Ma
                                            Qun’s wrists.</p>
                                        <p>She was actually quite clear about Ma Qun’s power, and as their hands met,
                                            Crow could instantly tell that he had stabbed down hard with all his might,
                                            and it was definitely not an act. Due to the amount of strength he used,
                                            even though she had caught onto his wrist on time, Ma Qun’s dagger had still
                                            stabbed into the muscles of his chest, and blood flowed out immediately.</p>
                                        <p>Crow quickly grabbed the dagger from his hands and flung it away, before
                                            quickly tending to his wounds. At that time, Ma Qun finally displayed his
                                            girl-chasing abilities, perhaps no weaker than Zhou Weiqing. Swiftly, he
                                            turned back and held Crow in his embrace with all his might, as if afraid
                                            she would run away.</p>
                                        <p>With Ma Qun’s raw physical strength, hugging a girl with all his might,
                                            perhaps only one like Crow would able to withstand it so easily without
                                            using any Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>In the courtyard, Yun Li stood beside Zhou Weiqing and said softly: “That
                                            little rascal Ma Qun… will he be alright? That girl, she is definitely not
                                            one to be trifled with!” Previously, he had clearly seen Crow’s battle
                                            prowess and her valiant actions when fighting against the black clad men.
                                            These few days, Crow had also broken through to the four-Jeweled stage, and
                                            adding on to her terrifying physical strength and her axes, she would
                                            definitely leave a deep impression on anyone.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, whether or not he is fine depends on
                                            how much of this great Don Juan’s [2. Literally translated, 情圣 is actually
                                            Passion Saint, but yeah you get what it means ;)] legacy he has learned and
                                            mastered.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li gave a disdainful humph and said: “Don Juan my foot, you have ran back
                                            alone and lost your girlfriend instead...”</p>
                                        <p>At the side, Lin TianAo looked at Zhou Weiqing with a surprised look. He
                                            suddenly sensed that the old, mischievous, rascally and perverted scoundrel,
                                            Zhou Weiqing, had somehow returned.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Lin TianAo had a rather strong understanding between each
                                            other, and seeing his eyes and look, Zhou Weiqing immediately smiled and
                                            said: “Although I was chased out today, I learned the best news I have heard
                                            in a long time. My Heavenly Bow Empire Royal Family has not been totally
                                            destroyed, and at least my father and the rest are still alive.” As such, he
                                            described what he had heard from Cai Cai.</p>
                                        <p>“Ten years. We still have a chance.” Lin TianAo said solemnly after hearing
                                            him out.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded. “Yes, we definitely have a chance. The next ten years
                                            will be the time for us to rise up. I will make them spit out everything
                                            that they have taken from me, ten times and more!”</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, they suddenly heard Crow’s startled cry from inside the
                                            room.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li’s face changed. “What do we do now?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, as if everything was in his grasp. “Everything
                                            is fine then, we do not need to care about them. This Ma Qun… his talent
                                            isn’t too bad!” From Crow’s startled cry and the worried tone, Zhou Weiqing
                                            could hear that the Self-Torture Trick had worked, and they were relatively
                                            okay.</p>
                                        <p>Since the Self-Torture Trick had already worked what else was there to say?
                                            What was left was for Ma Qun handle, and that was not anything that anyone
                                            else could teach any longer.</p>
                                        <p>*Peng* *Peng* *Peng* A knocking sound rang out from the door. Before Zhou
                                            Weiqing could speak, Little Four charged forward to pull open the door,
                                            while the rest of the team took on guarded positions. After all, none of
                                            them were clear who the previous black clad men were. If the Fei Li Empire
                                            was actually taking action against Zhou Weiqing, then none of them would
                                            have any chance of escaping.</p>
                                        <p>There were more than ten people standing outside, with Zang Lang standing at
                                            their head. Besides him, Zhou Weiqing also recognized a few others,
                                            including that bald headed bro of his. However, their actual number was
                                            lesser than what Zang Lang had told him previously. Including Zang Lang
                                            himself, there were only a dozen standing there.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing so many people in the courtyard, Zang Lang gave a small sound of
                                            surprise before leading his fellow brothers inside.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss Zhou, we have come.” Zang Lang walked all the way to Zhou Weiqing
                                            before stopping, saying in an abashed tone: “Originally, there were a few
                                            more of us. However, when some of them heard about you being chased out of
                                            the Academy…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled passively, saying: “I understand. For you to be able to
                                            bring so many people, I am already very pleasantly surprised.”</p>
                                        <p>Zang Lang took a deep breath. He did not know why, but in front of Zhou
                                            Weiqing, he always felt a unique pressure. “... Boss Zhou, we are after all
                                            here to be your Lifetime Follower. Besides me, the rest of them are all
                                            Physical Jewel Masters. To be able to Follow a talented Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master is our honour and luck. However, there are so many of us,
                                            and we are a little worried whether or not you are able to help us all with
                                            Consolidating Equipment Masters. In your opinion…”</p>
                                        <p>After all, it was a Lifetime Following, and one that required a Darkness
                                            Seal’s restriction. Zang Lang had to be responsible for those brothers who
                                            had followed him. When he said those words, he did not dare look into Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s eyes. Honestly speaking, when Zhou Weiqing was forced to leave the
                                            Academy this time, Zang Lang had been extremely hesitant about his decision
                                            to Follow him. However, the draw of a talented Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master was just too great, especially one so young like Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>However, when he finally reached here and saw so many people in the
                                            courtyard, he started to worry whether or not he and his brothers be able to
                                            actually gain Zhou Weiqing’s support on Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.</p>
                                        <p>At the side, Yun Li couldn’t help but say exasperatedly: “He alone might not
                                            be able to do so, but with my help, how can it not be possible?”</p>
                                        <p>Previously, Zang Lang had been too nervous, and did not notice the nearby Yun
                                            Li. At this point, spotting him here, he couldn’t help but start in
                                            surprise. “Teacher Li, you are here too?”</p>
                                        <p>Ever since Yun Li entered the Fei Li Royal Family Military Academy, he had
                                            always been rather proud and arrogant, and not all the students could be
                                            easily taught by him. In fact, he had only given the Commoner Class One a
                                            bit of teachings.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li glanced at Zhou Weiqing momentarily before saying passively: “He is my
                                            boss. Since he is here, I am naturally here as well. Did you really think
                                            his Followers would just be the mere few of you?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “With an additional High Level
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master, you should at least feel better and set your
                                            mind at ease right.”</p>
                                        <p>Before Zang Lang could nod in agreement, Yun Li had already interrupted in a
                                            dissatisfied tone. “What High Level Consolidating Equipment Master. My dear
                                            boss, I have already reached the Grandmaster stage!”</p>
                                        <p>It was Zhou Weiqing’s turn to be startled. “So fast?!”</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li said airily: “Originally, I was already about to breakthrough to the
                                            Grandmaster stage, and after competing with you and exchanging notes and
                                            learning, these few days I have been working extremely hard, and I have
                                            finally broken through successfully. A Grandmaster Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master before the age of thirty, have you seen that before? Haha, I will
                                            definitely reach the stage of God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master before
                                            you, and at that time, who knows, maybe you will be the one who wants to be
                                            my Follower. [3. Minor error by TJSS here actually I believe, Yun Li already
                                            told Zhou Weiqing about reaching Grandmaster in Chapter 112.1, but I guess
                                            we can just treat this as him explaining how he reached that stage]</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at him for a moment, then suddenly said seriously: “Yun
                                            Li, I think that when someone is too full of himself, it is not good for
                                            their cultivation; in fact it is not good at all. As such, I have decided to
                                            help you out and knock you off your pedestal. Little Miss Muddle.”</p>
