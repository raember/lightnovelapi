                                            Demon Sect were still waiting there for them. Although they were feeling
                                            terrible about Wu Yuehan being kidnapped from them, but it had already
                                            happened, and there was no use crying over spilt milk as they could not do
                                            anything about it. They could only wait there and pray that the Heavenly
                                            Emperor powerhouse would stick to his word return Wu Yuehan to them. No
                                            matter what, being able to bring back a live Young Miss was much better than
                                            losing her forever.</p>
                                        <p>In a flash of green light, Long Big Fatty descended from the skies with Wu
                                            Yuehan in tow. The two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses instantly perked up
                                            alertly, quickly advancing forward to greet them.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Long Shiya, the two of them were filled with hostility. However, they
                                            knew their strength was far below this Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and
                                            they could not show any signs of it. If not for that, they would definitely
                                            want to immediately tear Long Shiya from limb to limb. To the Heavenly Demon
                                            Sect, what happened in the past few days was definitely a terrible
                                            humiliation and disgrace.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch was not dressed in the same clothes she had left in, clearly
                                            having changed during her time away. At the same time, they both could see
                                            that her expression was weary and almost haggard. With their cultivation
                                            level and experience, how could they not see that she had lost her
                                            virginity?</p>
                                        <p>“Elders, I have returned.” Little Witch said with a faint smile, as if
                                            nothing had happened.</p>
                                        <p>The two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses started momentarily. How could Young
                                            Miss be so calm and composed after having lost her virtue? Their gaze
                                            flickered and landed onto Long Shiya, but he was not even looking at them,
                                            smiling gently at Little Witch.</p>
                                        <p>Wu Yuehan said: “Elders, please do not worry. Senior Long only asked me to
                                            help someone out, and the person who needed help happened to be a good
                                            friend of mine. Now that he has recovered, we can return. You two do not
                                            need to say anything, it was of my own free will. We do not need to head to
                                            the WanShou Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, when we return I will personally
                                            speak to my father.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes, Young Miss.” The two Heavenly King Stage powerhouse elders were still
                                            clearly confused, not knowing what was going on.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya smiled faintly and said: “Yuehan, this time is truly a big
                                            inconvenience for you. Do not worry, Little Fatty has some things to clear
                                            up first, and once he is done, I will personally bring him to look for you.
                                            When that time comes, you just make the preparations. Alright, he is still
                                            quite unstable, I will return first.” After saying all that, he did not even
                                            look at the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses, and soared up into the air
                                            and disappeared swiftly.</p>
                                        <p>“Young Miss, are you okay?” The two Heavenly King Stage powerhouse Elders
                                            quickly advanced forward to ask Little Witch concernedly. The Elder on the
                                            left said angrily: “It must be that old bastard, did he threaten you to say
                                            that? Although the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor is powerful, our Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect is not to be trifled with as well. The Sect Master will
                                            definitely get revenge for Young Miss.”</p>
                                        <p>A bitter smile crossed Wu Yuehan’s face and she said: “Elders, I was not
                                            threatened at all. I truly did it of my own accord, and I was willing to do
                                            so. It is truly a coincidence… that Senior Long’s disciple is the person I
                                            mentioned to the Sect previously. Father originally wished that I marry him…
                                            this time is…”</p>
                                        <p>“”Ahh?” The two Elders stared speechlessly at each other. What kind of magic
                                            was that, such a coincidence?!</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch sighed softly. Although she did not regret that her virtue had
                                            been stolen by Zhou Weiqing, but deep inside her heart, she did not wish
                                            that it had been taken under such dubious circumstances. However, now that
                                            things had already played out like this, there was no turning back
                                            already.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Back atop the Fire Spirit Mountain, Zhou Weiqing slept deeply for an entire
                                            day and night. As he slowly drifted out of his dreams into awakening, he
                                            felt his entire body itching, especially his back which was especially
                                            itchy. He moaned subconsciously before extending all his limbs out to the
                                            maximum in a lazy stretch.</p>
                                        <p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing felt his entire body, down to his muscles, bones
                                            and even meridian channels were straining with a strange sound. The next
                                            moment, he felt an unprecedented relaxing and comfortable feeling throughout
                                            his entire body, as if he had been given a new lease on life.</p>
                                        <p>So comfortable! Feels so good! Opening his eyes, Zhou Weiqing’s thoughts were
                                            still a little slow. After all, he had been ‘cultivating’ for almost forty
                                            days, and his consciousness was still a bit muddled.</p>
                                        <p><i>Eh? Why do I feel so weird '</i><i>down below'? </i>Zhou Weiqing
                                            subconsciously touched himself questioningly, and his mouth twitched
                                            slightly as fragments of memories trickled back into his mind one after the
                                            other. <i>Was it just me… or was I just dreaming that I had intimate
                                                relations with a girl?? A long time… so tight… feeling so good… that’s
                                                not real right? Wasn’t I cultivating under Master’s protection? Was it
                                                all a dream?</i></p>
                                        <p>“Damn little brat, you are finally awake.” Long Shiya’’s voice rang out and
                                            the thick smoke around suddenly cleared, revealing his stout figure.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, only then did Zhou Weiqing realise that he was still atop the
                                            Fire Spirit Mountain. To his surprise, for the sheer heat and high
                                            temperatures of the Fire Spirit Mountain, he did not even feel hot at all,
                                            in fact feeling extremely comfortable.</p>
                                        <p>“Master, I succeeded in Awakening and Fusing?” Zhou Weiqing asked.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya nodded in a satisfied manner, saying:: “Little brat, luckily your
                                            willpower is strong and tenacious enough, and you actually succeeded. More
                                            so, you did so in a shorter time than even I expected. However, this time,
                                            your success has come at quite a price!”</p>
                                        <p>At such, Long Shiya described in detail the entire happenings during the last
                                            thirty odd days that Zhou Weiqing had spent in the depths of the volcano
                                            training; all the various surprises and changes that had happened. That
                                            would also allow Zhou Weiqing to understand what had happened, as well as
                                            the various changes that happened to him and allow him to start
                                            familiarising himself with those changes… only then would he be able to make
                                            use of them and convert it into actual fighting prowess.</p>
                                        <p>At the end, naturally Long Shiya could not avoid speaking about Little
                                            Witch.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing heard the word ‘Sacrifice’, his first reaction was to think
                                            of Shangguan Bing’er. In that instant, he suddenly realised he missed her so
                                            much. He had not seen her for such a long time, and yet he was collecting
                                            more ‘love debts’.</p>
                                        <p>This time, after saving Tian’er, if he managed to return he would definitely
                                            have to head back to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. He only had to defeat that
                                            Shangguan Xue’er, then he could be with Bing’er at last. And… there was
                                            still Fei’er to think about. Sigh.. things were indeed messy.</p>
                                        <p>“Wait… Master… what did you just say? You found a girl to be a Sacrifice for
                                            me and I actually did that to her… ?” Lost in his own thoughts, all of a
                                            suddenly Zhou Weiqing was abruptly disrupted from them as Long Shiya’s words
                                            finally registered in his mind, and he stared with utter shock at his
                                            teacher.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya said sorrowfully: “In my entire life, I have never done anything
                                            against my conscience, and you little brat made your teacher ruin that
                                            record, and almost destroying my reputation! If I didn’t help you look for a
                                            Sacrifice, do you think you can actually Awake and return to
                                            consciousness?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stared at his teacher, jaw agape, his mind in a blur. His love
                                            life was already messy enough, and now he had to add one more, especially
                                            since he had ‘taken’ her as a Sacrifice to his Demonic Attribute.
                                            This...</p>
                                        <p>“I know this will not be comfortable news for you to, but as a man, since you
                                            have already done it, you better take responsibility for it. As the saying
                                            goes, a man already in debt would not mind incurring more debt, since you
                                            already have so many women, one more won’t make a big difference.” Long Big
                                            Fatty said carelessly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s heart twitched inwardly! What kind of saying was that… a man
                                            already in debt would not mind incurring more debt?! There was another
                                            saying, three women was like an opera, with so many women, what would his
                                            life be like in the future?</p>
                                        <p>“Your luck is not too bad, at least she is a great beauty, and she also knows
                                            who you are. Such a good girl, very sensible and understanding… being
                                            bullied by you for an entire day and night! Yet, she did not blame you in
                                            the end. Little Fatty, you better not let Little Witch down!”</p>
                                        <p>“Wait… what?! Who did you say it was again?” This time, Zhou Weiqing’s jaw
                                            truly dropped.</p>
                                        <p>“Little Witch… Wu Yuehan… she said you two knew each other! Don’t tell me you
                                            don’t know who she is?” Long Shiya said.</p>
                                        <p>Know? Of course he knew her, but it was without question she was a
                                            troublesome one indeed! Previously, Zhou Weiqing had painstakingly avoided
                                            Little Witch after their experiences. After all, he did owe the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect a debt in one sense, since he had read their Heavenly Demon Sect
                                            Demonic Manual, and it had been of great help in him learning how to
                                            cultivate his Demonic Attribute and learning how to use his Devour Skill.
                                            However, the Heavenly Demon Sect resided in the Bai Da Empire and was aiding
                                            them, and who knew if the destruction of the Heavenly Bow Empire had their
                                            shadow behind it. It was just too messy and troublesome indeed.</p>
                                        <p>In that moment, Zhou Weiqing felt a migraine incoming. The comfortable
                                            feeling after the Bloodline Fusion and evolving had disappeared.</p>
                                        <p>Towards his Master, he did not have to hide anything. As such, he explained
                                            the entire relationship and what had happened between him and Little Witch
                                            all that time, as well as all his issues with the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p>
                                        <p>After hearing his explanations, Long Shiya’s expression remained impassive as
                                            he said passively: “What is there for you to think or stress about? Any
                                            other matter I will not interfere, but in this matter between you and the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect, I will take charge. In the past, you were afraid that
                                            they might take advantage of you, even take control of you… but with this
                                            old man here, what do you have to be afraid of? The Bai Da Empire is not the
                                            same as your Heavenly Bow Empire, as one of the stronger Empires in the
                                            entire Mainland, it is unlikely that they will have any close connection
                                            with the Heavenly Demon Sect. Otherwise, it is tantamount to outright
                                            opposing the other four Great Saint Lands, and they would never do something
                                            like that. It is too much of a risk to them. As such, I can practically
                                            guarantee that your Heavenly Bow Empire’s destruction has nothing to do with
                                            the Heavenly Demon Sect. To put it more bluntly, with your Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire’s original strength, would the Bai Da Empire even need the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect to destroy them? Nonsense. Alright, it is settled between you and
                                            Little Witch then. You have already done that to her, and especially under
                                            such a forced circumstance, how can you not take responsibility? In any
                                            case, now is not the time to think too much on this… everything else is of
                                            lesser importance now than getting your cultivation level and strength
                                            up.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was still somewhat dazed, and upon hearing Long Shiya’s words,
                                            it seemed like things weren’t as messy as he feared. As for the situation
                                            between all these young ladies, even he could not untangle that tangled web,
                                            and he could only sigh inwardly for now. Amongst all the girls he was
                                            attached to, it was without a doubt that his feelings were strongest for
                                            Shangguan Bing’er, followed by Tian’er and Shangguan Fei’er. Now… there was
                                            another Little Witch added to the mix… that was up to four!</p>
