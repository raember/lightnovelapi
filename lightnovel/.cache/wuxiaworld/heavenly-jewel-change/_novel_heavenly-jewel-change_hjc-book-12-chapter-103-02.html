                                            than nothing in this case! Both of them quickly moved towards the backline,
                                            unleashing their Heavenly Energy towards the dragon.</p>
                                        <p>With their help, Tian’er’s expression grew better. Under their efforts, the
                                            rate of the Life force ebbing out of the mother dragon slowed
                                            drastically.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a sudden burst of blue light shot past them and fell
                                            onto the mother dragon. The thick blue light was not hostile, gentle and
                                            filled with Life Attribute Heavenly Energy, imbued with life force. With
                                            this fresh infusion of immense life energy, the mother dragon’s wounds
                                            finally stabilized, her scary looking wounds finally stopping their
                                            bleeding, and her ebbing life force finally started recovering slowly
                                            instead.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er turned around in surprise, only to see Little Witch. She did not know
                                            when or how Little Witch had arrived beside her, but the familiar blue
                                            hibiscus mutabilis was behind her, constantly infusing a large amount of
                                            life energy into the mother dragon. At the same time, a few rays of light
                                            shot forth from the hibiscus to wrap around a few nearby large trees,
                                            drawing their life force to replenish the mother dragon’s.</p>
                                        <p>In that moment, among all the Elemental Attributes, all the four which held
                                            any form of healing properties were present. Water, Light, Life and Divine.
                                            Instantly, the healing effect seemed to multiply, and take full effect on
                                            the mother dragon. Her eyes slowly turned from sorrow to a surprised
                                            delight, and with a slow lift of one of her claws, she pulled the large egg
                                            in front of her into her embrace before closing her eyes. Without question,
                                            she was cooperating with the four healers in circulating the energy in self
                                            recovery.</p>
                                        <p>At that side, it seemed things had stabilized. But the ZhongTian Battle Team
                                            leader, Zhan LingTian, was growing more and more furious.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, everything was going according to plan, everything falling in
                                            place perfectly for them. The dragon, the egg, both were pretty much in
                                            their bag. At most, they would have to give the BaoPo Battle Team some
                                            benefits to reward them for their help. Who could have expected that this
                                            Zhou Weiqing would jump out and ruin everything, followed by a Divine
                                            Heavenly Spirit Tiger and those Fei Li Battle Team members! They were
                                            actually somehow reversing that sure-win battle situation!</p>
                                        <p>The moment he saw Zhou Weiqing, he instantly remembered what Shangguan Fei’er
                                            told him. It was this bastard that had stolen the first kiss of his goddess.
                                            Now, he was here once more to ruin his perfect time.</p>
                                        <p>The more he thought about this, the more furious Zhan LingTian got, until it
                                            reached a breaking point.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, the God Tier Consolidated Long Spear in Zhan LingTian’s
                                            hands swept out, forcing back his opponent in an abrupt motion. With a
                                            sudden flash, he appeared right before Zhou Weiqing, the spear striking out
                                            towards him!</p>
                                        <p>The Elemental Jewels around Zhan LingTian’s left wrist was also an
                                            Alexandrite stone! He had two Elemental Attributes, but although it was only
                                            two attributes, they were an unbelievably unique existence in their own
                                            right. His two Attributes were actually the Light and Darkness Attribute,
                                            two absolute opposites!</p>
                                        <p>Ordinarily, if two opposite attributes like that appeared for a single
                                            person, then there should be no possibility for him to cultivate. In fact,
                                            there would exist the possibility of self imploding if he should try to
                                            force himself to cultivate.</p>
                                        <p>However, this Zhan LingTian was truly unique. He had started cultivating from
                                            a young age, and had actually managed to cultivate these two opposing
                                            attributes through sheer talent and willpower. The entire left half of his
                                            body held the Darkness Attribute, while the entire right half of his body
                                            held the Light Attribute. The middle intersection of his body was the
                                            divider, protected by Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, the Light and Darkness Attributes were opposing, but if coordinated
                                            and mixed well with proper control, that opposing power could actually be
                                            taken advantage of, causing it to have an extremely great strength.</p>
                                        <p>In the entire younger generation of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, if one were
                                            to ignore the Consolidated Equipment and just focus on cultivation level
                                            alone, Zhan LingTian was actually the top. It was only because Shangguan
                                            Xue’er had the Boundless Infinitum Set that her overall power was above
                                            his.</p>
                                        <p>It was not without reason that Zhan LingTian was called the top genius within
                                            the past several hundred years in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. At least, he
                                            had shown he was able to take the upper hand in a fight with the leader of
                                            the Heavenly Snow Mountain. After all, he was facing another Heavenly Beast
                                            at the same time, a Snow Eagle.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhan LingTian’s heart was filled with a violent killing intent, as
                                            he targeted Zhou Weiqing with all his might. That killing aura, almost
                                            coalesced into a tangible feeling caused Zhou Weiqing to almost
                                            suffocate.</p>
                                        <p>A flash of yellow light. With a swift step, Lin TianAo appeared in front of
                                            Zhou Weiqing, his five-Jeweled Assembly Shield Set blocking the incoming
                                            blow unhesitatingly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian’s Consolidated Equipment was also a specially designed
                                            Legendary Set, but with a maximum of nine pieces only. He currently had four
                                            pieces, just like Shangguan Fei’er.</p>
                                        <p>The long spear in his hands was one of the Legendary Set pieces, 1.2 zhang
                                            long [1. One 丈 (zhang) is about 3.3metres], as thick as an infant’s arms.
                                            One half of it was gold, and the other half black, even down to the sharp
                                            end. In between the gold and black colour, there was a faint white line
                                            separating the two; it was almost a mirror image of his own internal body
                                            mechanism.</p>
                                        <p>As the spear pierced out, it was imbued with both Light and Darkness Heavenly
                                            Energy. As soon as the two energies left the spear, they immediately caused
                                            an immense explosion.</p>
                                        <p>When Light met Darkness, the effect was even more obvious than water meeting
                                            fire. This was even more so when considering Zhan LingTian’s seven-Jeweled
                                            cultivation level.</p>
                                        <p>In that massive explosion, even with Lin TianAo’s powerful defenses, he was
                                            still knocked back by that powerful strike. The next instant, with a tilt of
                                            his spear, Zhan LingTian sent him flying back.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of cultivation level, Zhan LingTian was above Shangguan Fei’er, and
                                            his absolute power was comparable or even higher than hers as well,
                                            especially with his battle experience, killing intent and resolution, it was
                                            not something that Shangguan Fei’er had within her, at least not
                                            currently.</p>
                                        <p>Without Lin TianAo to block him, Zhan LingTian was now facing Zhou Weiqing
                                            directly. Having knocked Lin TianAo back with the front of the spear, he
                                            struck down savagely and swiftly towards Zhou Weiqing’s chest with the butt
                                            of the spear.</p>
                                        <p>However, Lin TianAo’s block had given Zhou Weiqing the opportunity to unleash
                                            his Demonic Change State. Only under the Demonic Change State would he have
                                            the slightest chance of protecting himself from Zhan LingTian.</p>
                                        <p>His Legendary Dual God Strength Hammers appeared unhesitatingly. Due to the
                                            fact that he had already used the Consolidating Equipment God Protective
                                            Aura once today, it did not appear once more. With the crying-face hammer,
                                            Zhou Weiqing struck upwards, forcibly blocking Zhan LingTian’s attack. At
                                            the same time, the WanShou Battle Team leader recovered himself, striking
                                            out towards Zhan LingTian’s back.</p>
                                        <p>Another massive explosion. Zhou Weiqing felt himself swallowed by a
                                            previously incomparable explosion, as if he was in the midst of a maelstrom.
                                            In that moment, he could no longer hear anything from outside, as if he had
                                            been transported to another world by himself.</p>
                                        <p>Even with his immense strength, the boost from the Demonic Change State and
                                            his Legendary Hammers, he was still unable to block Zhan LingTian’s spear.
                                            The crying-face hammer was forcibly knocked back, smashing onto his own
                                            chest and sending him flying back.</p>
                                        <p>The Immortal Deity Shield burst into effect at this moment, the fourteen
                                            energy whirlpools at his Death Acupuncture Points whirling at their maximum
                                            speed, combining efforts to accept the blow and reduce it.</p>
                                        <p>Luckily, Zhan LingTian had been blocked by Lin TianAo earlier. Although he
                                            had easily knocked Lin TianAo away, and this blow was dealt with intense
                                            anger, he still had to focus some attention towards the dire threat from the
                                            WanShou Battle Team leader behind him. As such, he did not dare to use his
                                            full strength in the attack.</p>
                                        <p>Thanks to that, Zhou Weiqing managed to survive it. Even so, when he was sent
                                            flying back, he could not help but vomit out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, he did not let Zhan LingTian get off scot-free. The
                                            crying-face hammer had been imbued with the boosted Curse of Doom, landing
                                            on him as well.</p>
                                        <p>After knocking both Lin TianAo and Zhou Weiqing back, Zhan LingTian swept his
                                            right foot out, forcibly kicking Crow, who had been striking down with both
                                            her axes, and sending her flying back as well. In the next instant, he
                                            twisted his body, barely avoiding Xiao Yan’s fireball. With his spear as a
                                            pivot, he vaulted back up again, and was once again clashing with the
                                            WanShou Battle Team leader without skipping a beat.</p>
                                        <p>In just the few short moments, Zhan LingTian had used his full power to its
                                            maximum effect. Although he did not succeed in killing Zhou Weiqing as
                                            planned, he had managed to stop the young archer from shooting his harassing
                                            arrows, and also dealt him an injury. The power of his Light and Darkness
                                            Spear had definitely given Zhou Weiqing a heavy blow. If not for Lin TianAo,
                                            and the power of his Legendary hammer, he might have been blown into bits by
                                            now.</p>
                                        <p><i>So Strong! </i>Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in his heart. Although he had
                                            vomited out a mouthful of blood, his injury wasn’t too serious, while Zhan
                                            LingTian’s blow had also sparked the ferocity in his heart.</p>
                                        <p>With a furious yell, Zhou Weiqing swung the Legendary Hammers in his hands,
                                            his right leg striking the ground savagely as he leapt up high.</p>
                                        <p>The swirling thick black tiger tattoos on his body started to fluctuate
                                            violently, as if they were all coming to life. This was especially so for
                                            the ‘King’ word on his forehead, which was currently glowing
                                            brilliantly.</p>
                                        <p>In mid air, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes turned cold, his entire body giving forth a
                                            strange aura. In that instant, his gaze seemed to give others a noble
                                            arrogance, an unassuming yet exalted loftiness, as if the people below him
                                            were all merely lowly beings. His eyes, which had turned bloodshot earlier
                                            due to the Demonic Change State, had suddenly turned a deep purple.</p>
                                        <p>Hammers in hand, his physique broadened further by the Demonic Change State,
                                            when his body rose up into the air to the maximum point as propelled by his
                                            kick, he suddenly stopped right there in the sky, hovering there instead of
                                            falling back down as if he could defy gravity.</p>
                                        <p>A noble and proud air suddenly filled the air, and the two Legendary Hammers
                                            in his hands abruptly glowed with a purple-red light.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing levitated in the sky, a five metre tall phantom illusory
                                            image slowly appeared behind him.</p>
                                        <p>When that phantom illusory image appeared, everyone on the battlefield slowed
                                            down or stopped. Even the mother dragon, whose eyes had been closed as she
                                            was in the midst of healing, opened her eyes to stare at Zhou Weiqing in
                                            midair.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian exclaimed in shock: “Heavenly Skill Image!”</p>
                                        <p>As the name might suggest, Heavenly Skill Image referred to having the image
                                            of the Heavenly Beast primed and appearing when the Elemental Jewel Stored
                                            Skill was used. However, in order for this to happen, that Heavenly Beast
                                            had to be at the Heavenly God Stage!</p>
                                        <p>Even an ordinary Heavenly God Stage Beast’s Skill would be rated at twelve
                                            stars, definitely the very definition of terrifying.</p>
                                        <p><i>How could it be? How could this be?!</i></p>
                                        <p>At that moment, not just Zhan LingTian, but everyone present, had that in
                                            their mind. This Zhou Weiqing was merely a three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master, how could he possibly have a Heavenly God Stage Skill?! Even in the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island Skill Storing Palace, there were only very few
                                            Heavenly God Stage Heavenly Beasts, each of them gathered painstakingly by
                                            generations of Heaven’s Expanse Palace powerhouses, expending much manpower
                                            and effort in doing so.</p>
