                                        <p>Flying into a rage, Xue AoTian almost killed his own daughter with his own
                                            hands. However, in the end, he only had this one daughter, and he could not
                                            land the final blow.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Lion Prince, he could only swallow his pride and anger to accept
                                            it. For the sake of the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord position, as
                                            well as for the fact that he truly liked Tian’er, he could only endure it,
                                            telling Xue AoTian that he was still willing to take Tian’er as his bride.
                                            Feeling guilty towards him, Xue AoTian ended up doting more on this disciple
                                            of his.</p>
                                        <p>Half a year had already passed, and the engagement ceremony was already
                                            complete despite all of Tian’er’s protests. Even when she threatened to take
                                            her own life, she was unable to change Xue AoTian’s mind, and he brought his
                                            daughter alongside himself. The stubborn Mountain Lord truly believed that
                                            time could change everything, and such an outstanding talent like the Lion
                                            Prince Gu Yingbing would eventually move his daughter and enter her
                                            heart.</p>
                                        <p>In order to sever Tian’er’s remaining fantasies, Xue AoTian personally set
                                            their wedding date, which was three months from the current day.</p>
                                        <p>“This is the Dragon Silencing Seal from the Demonic Dragon Lady.” Xue AoTian
                                            said solemnly as he analyzed the image. “... Underestimating your enemy is
                                            always the worst flaw. Nine-Jewels against Four-Jewels, and he could still
                                            be tricked. Batulu, how did you teach your son?” Although he did not release
                                            his aura, Xue AoTian’s words caused Batulu to start sweating profusely
                                            despite the icy cold temperature.</p>
                                        <p>“Demonic Change State… Dragon Silencing Seal… And this… Darkness, Demonic and
                                            Lightning Attribute Fusion Skill… Hmm… a tri-Attribute Venom made from those
                                            energies.” As he spoke to that point, Xue AoTian’s eyes narrowed.</p>
                                        <p>“YingBing, arrange for a place for Batulu to get some rest, he can come
                                            collect his son in three days time.” The Dark Demon God Lightning might be
                                            too much for a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse like Shangguan Longyin to
                                            handle, but it was unable to stop the strongest man in the world, who held
                                            the Divine Attribute. Of course, Butler had already been suffering from the
                                            venom for such a long time, and even for Xue AoTian, it would not be an easy
                                            feat to totally remove the poison.</p>
                                        <p>Batulu felt so lucky, as if he had struck the jackpot. He did not know what
                                            to say or do, and could only kneel there kowtowing in gratitude.</p>
                                        <p>The light image finally disappeared, and Tian’er stood there as if her soul
                                            had been drained out of her. The next instant, a brilliant flash shone
                                            forth, and both Xue AoTian and Tian’er disappeared. Along with them, the
                                            unconscious Butler also disappeared.</p>
                                        <p>When his Master had finally disappeared, the Lion Prince Gu Yingbing abruptly
                                            punched out viciously, his fist stabbing into the empty air, causing a loud
                                            explosion. His entire body seemed to be vibrating with sheer rage, his head
                                            of golden red hair whipping about in the wind.</p>
                                        <p>“Bastard, it must be that bastard!” Gu Yingbing felt as if his rage was about
                                            to erupt out of his body. Abruptly, he took a step forward, grabbing the
                                            Wolf King Batulu and howling angrily: “Tell me, where did your son meet this
                                            youth? Tell me everything in detail, don’t leave anything out, not even the
                                            most insignificant thing.”</p>
                                        <p>Batulu was given a fright by the sudden outburst of the Lion Prince Gu
                                            Yingbing, and he dared not delay, hurriedly telling everything he knew.</p>
                                        <p>“ZhongTian Empire… Northern borders… the North West Armies… Good, very good.”
                                            The words were spat out through gritted teeth, grinding so hard that the
                                            sound was audible. He felt as if the blood was about the burst out of his
                                            body with anger, and his eyes danced with rage and the light of mania,
                                            killing intent clear as day in the atmosphere.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Deep in the Heavenly Snow Castle… a room that was almost sealed airtight with
                                            sculpted ice… the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord appeared with his
                                            daughter. As for Butler, he had disappeared to another area.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Tian’er’s heart was still shaken. She had not seen Zhou Weiqing
                                            for more than half a year, and seeing him so suddenly without warning, how
                                            could her heart be at peace? The emotions and feelings she had buried deep
                                            within erupted like an active volcano, uncontrollable despite her best
                                            efforts. Alas, she could only lower her head in silence, not daring to look
                                            at her father.</p>
                                        <p>“Is it him?” Xue AoTian said passively.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er did not reply, biting her lower lip softly. She did not dare make a
                                            sound, as fear and dread rose slowly from her heart, sinking deep into the
                                            pits of her stomach.</p>
                                        <p>“Is it him?” Xue AoTian’s voice grew sterner.</p>
                                        <p>With a sudden thud, Tian’er knelt down in front of her father. Tears
                                            streaming down her cheeks, she said in a trembling voice: “Father, please, I
                                            beg you, let him go. I will marry Bro Gu, I won’t look for him anymore,
                                            okay? Please, let him go.” She was clear that if her father wanted to kill
                                            someone, no matter even if the person was the leader of a Great Saint Lands,
                                            he or she might not be able to escape… let alone Zhou Weiqing. To be able to
                                            find him, that was an easy task for Xue AoTian.</p>
                                        <p>To her immense surprise, Xue AoTian actually sighed. “Get up, I won’t kill
                                            him, and I won’t blame you anymore.” He held her and helped her up, a
                                            strange look of being deep in thought on his face.</p>
                                        <p>A flick of his fingers, and the tears on his daughter’s face disappeared.
                                            “Silly girl, why did you not tell me about him? If I knew that was so…
                                            father would not be so strict with you. Indeed, this cannot be blamed on
                                            you.”</p>
                                        <p>“Ahh?” By now, Tian’er was totally confused, not knowing what her father was
                                            speaking about. She could only stare in surprise at Xue AoTian, whose face
                                            had a hint of regret and apology.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian said: “No wonder you would be so attracted to him, that is not
                                            your fault, but it is a certainty due to the Attributes he has. Who would
                                            think… that someone like that would actually exist in this world… to have
                                            both the Demonic Attribute and Time Attribute at the same time! More so, his
                                            Demonic Attribute looks to be of the purest kind, a first generation who
                                            Awakened it. Both you and he have two Saint Attributes, added to the fact
                                            that his Demonic Change State is also of a tiger bloodline… naturally he
                                            would hold a great attraction to you. Being together with him… that should
                                            have a strong benefit to your cultivation right?”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er nodded subconsciously. Naturally, she remembered how they had met in
                                            the first place, and she had known about the Saint Attributes being a
                                            benefit to her cultivation. It had been that strange aura that had drawn her
                                            to him in the first place, and being together with him all that time had
                                            indeed sped up her cultivation greatly. She had even originally thought
                                            about staying with him all the way until she broke through the Heavenly King
                                            Stage to make full use of him. [1. The excuse she gave herself the first
                                            time she tried to kill him to drain his power]</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian sighed once more. “What a shame… if I had met him ten years
                                            earlier… perhaps I would not have opposed you marrying him.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er stared at her father with her jaw agape. She had never imagined that
                                            her father would actually show such a sudden change after watching Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s fight in the image.</p>
                                        <p>“How old is he?” Xue AoTian thought for a moment before asking.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er said: “Seventeen years old… not even eighteen I think.”</p>
                                        <p>Another look of shock appeared on Xue AoTian’s face, and he exclaimed:
                                            “Seventeen years old only…” His brow furrowed deeply, as if he had met with
                                            a problem he could not solve.</p>
                                        <p>Light flashed in his eyes, but no one could tell what he was thinking
                                            about.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er did not hold any hope about the sudden change in her father’s
                                            attitude. In all her memory, as long as her father had made a decision, it
                                            could never be changed.</p>
                                        <p>“Father, you really won’t kill him?” Tian’er asked tentatively once more.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian nodded and said: “This could be a chance, a turning point, for our
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain… for you. If you had told me about him earlier,
                                            perhaps there might still have been a chance to deal with things between you
                                            and Yingbing, to turn things around. Alas, it is too late, you have already
                                            gone through the engagement ceremony. Things are troublesome then.”</p>
                                        <p>“Turn things around?” As soon as she heard that, Tian’er felt joy overwhelm
                                            her, and she asked excitedly.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian continued: “He has the Demonic and Time Attributes, and you have
                                            the Divine and Spirit Attributes. The four Saint Attributes, when gathered
                                            together and cultivating, both of you would have an extremely high chance of
                                            breaking through the Heavenly King Stage before the age of thirty. If that
                                            was so, you two might actually reach the Heavenly God Stage in the future,
                                            perhaps even breaking through together… and more importantly, have the
                                            chance to break through to a stage that I have never reached and
                                            beyond.”</p>
                                        <p>“If you had told me details about him earlier and brought him back, perhaps I
                                            could have taken him as disciple and maybe even allow you two to be
                                            together. Although our Heavenly Snow Mountain rules disallow passing on the
                                            position of Lord to females, but if you can truly raise to the cultivation
                                            level of Heavenly God Tier and beyond, who would dare speak otherwise, not
                                            even the other powerful Tribes of the WanShou Empire.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er was stunned, totally stunned. She had never in her wildest dreams
                                            imagine that her father would speak of such to her. Clearly, in her father’s
                                            eyes, Zhou Weiqing’s talent was truly important, perhaps even causing him to
                                            regret making the deal between the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger Tribe and
                                            Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion Tribe.</p>
                                        <p>“Father, let me go look for him now and bring him back, okay?” Tian’er said
                                            urgently.</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian shook his head sternly and said: “No, it is too late for that. One
                                            cannot go back on their word. You have already been betrothed to Yingbing,
                                            and you will be married to him soon. Although that little boyfriend of yours
                                            is extremely talented, but he is still after all just one person. Unless he
                                            has sufficient powers behind him that can awe the lions, and after that,
                                            able to snatch you away from Yingbing in a fair fight… otherwise, even I
                                            cannot change such a decision that has already been made.”</p>
                                        <p>The hope that had just risen up in Tian’er’s heart was once again cruelly
                                            dashed, her heart turning ice cold in despair. What force or influence did
                                            Zhou Weiqing have behind him? Even if he had some connection with the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace, it was not enough for them to support him in such a
                                            matter. Let alone the fact that the Heaven’s Expanse Palace were mortal
                                            enemies with the Heavenly Snow Mountain, whether or not their aid would be
                                            of any help in such a matter… just the fact that his connection was through
                                            his relationship with Shangguan Bing’er, how could that possibly be of use?
                                            How could the Heaven’s Expanse Palace possibly help him come seek her hand
                                            in marriage?</p>
                                        <p>Xue AoTian sighed and said: “Alright, enough, don’t think so much about this.
                                            Go back and prepare to be a bride… Yingbing truly likes you alot, no matter
                                            what you had done previously, he still does not reject you. Such a husband,
                                            what do you have to be dissatisfied with? Go then, Father needs to cultivate
                                            now.”</p>
                                        <p>When Tian’er left, she had resumed her previous zombie-like semblance,
                                            causing Xue AoTian to furrow his brow in worry. Despite his adamant stance,
                                            he did love his daughter very much. At the same time, in his heart, he
                                            started to feel curious about Zhou Weiqing, wanting to have a look at this
                                            youth who had stolen his daughter’s heart so strongly, to attract her so
                                            much.</p>
                                        <p><i>Should I arrange things in secret? What a troublesome mess.</i></p>
                                        <p>At this point, it was extremely rare, nearly impossible to find something to
                                            cause trouble to the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord. Yet, such a thing
                                            had just appeared right now. With his status, how could he possibly allow
                                            his daughter to secretly cultivate together with Zhou Weiqing. Yet, the two
                                            Saint Attributes that Zhou Weiqing had caused even Xue AoTian’s heart to
                                            itch on his daughter’s behalf. This was an unbelievable opportunity after
                                            all. The Thirteenth Heavenly Jewel. What would that be like? The legendary
                                            Heavenly Jewel Change Stage! [2. Roll credits (I may have watched too much
