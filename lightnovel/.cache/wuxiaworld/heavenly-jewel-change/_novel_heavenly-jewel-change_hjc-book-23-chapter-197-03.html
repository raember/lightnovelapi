                                            invaded his body, warping into three icy cold auras that started to spread
                                            throughout his body.</p>
                                        <p><i>Not good!</i></p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly King assassin had rampaged throughout the entire continent for
                                            so many years, and he had faced countless dangers and slain countless
                                            opponents. In the shortest time, he made the most accurate choice. Sensing
                                            the invasion of the cold evil power, he instantly judged that the sheer
                                            toxicity of the poison was not something he could handle. Once it truly
                                            spread through his body, he would be in serious trouble with endless
                                            disastrous possibilities.</p>
                                        <p>As such, he made an instant snap decision that not many else could. In an
                                            instant the black rapier spun around, striking deep into his own chest. A
                                            pierce, and a flick, meat and blood sprayed out as he forcefully dug out.
                                            The blood sprayed in midair, forming a strange blue, black and grey colours,
                                            before dissipating in the air.</p>
                                        <p>With such a powerful will to live, the Heavenly King assassin had
                                            unbelievably managed to counter the tri-element venom of the scorpion tail
                                            hook of Zhou Weiqing’s evolution.</p>
                                        <p>It could not be said to be luck, instead a more accurate description would be
                                            power, guts and vision. With his sword blocking, he was able to avoid the
                                            majority of the blow from the scorpion’s tail, and in the shortest possible
                                            time he had sealed his meridians, and finally he used his own sword to cut
                                            himself and force out all the venom. Only with all of that was he able to
                                            survive that onslaught. However, that also had a heavy price, as this
                                            assassin had finally suffered a serious injury, greatly sapping his
                                            vitality. To be fair, he had not lost to Zhou Weiqing, but he had lost to
                                            the sudden arrival of the two girls and more importantly, his lack of
                                            understanding of this new state of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation.</p>
                                        <p>After entering the second state of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, Zhou
                                            Weiqing was only able to fight in close combat. However, in such a state,
                                            his melee capabilities had already risen to an unbelievably terrifying
                                            height, especially his defense. Even that Heavenly King assassin was not
                                            able to break through such a defense with ease, and that had been the most
                                            important adjustment that caused the series of snowballing changes leading
                                            to a different final result.</p>
                                        <p>Without any hesitation at all, a thick black tail of flames spurted out from
                                            the Heavenly King assassin’s back. In an instant, he warped into a stream of
                                            light, disappearing into the distance within moments.</p>
                                        <p>An icy cold voice rang out in the air. “I’ll be back.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er and Shangguan Xue’er both landed on the ground at the same time, both
                                            their eyes showing their shock. This was especially for Shangguan Xue’er;
                                            with her pride, her heart was currently filled with fear. It had just been
                                            too dangerous. It had truly been a fine line then, and Zhou Weiqing had
                                            almost lost his life so many times. Although the assassin was only at the
                                            Heavenly King Stage, his assassination skills and offense… especially even
                                            when trying to kill someone so much lower level than himself like Zhou
                                            Weiqing, he still chose to ambush and launch a sneak attack, in the best
                                            possible time. It could be said that it was a lot of luck that Zhou Weiqing
                                            had survived.</p>
                                        <p>In the air, Zhou Weiqing did not attempt to chase. Instead, he levitated
                                            there, wings spread out, as if a Demon King who had achieved victory.</p>
                                        <p>By now, the battle on the ground had long ended. Currently, the two hundred
                                            Heavy Cavalry soldiers were below Zhou Weiqing, staring up at him with shock
                                            and awe in their eyes.</p>
                                        <p>No matter the Berserker or Gold Crow Tribe soldiers, they were extremely
                                            proud and confident in their own combat abilities. However, that fight in
                                            the sky was truly something they had never witnessed before. Only at this
                                            time did they realise how terrifying a true powerhouse really was.
                                            Especially for the Heaven and Earth Anomaly that Zhou Weiqing had somehow
                                            activated, it had truly left a lasting impression in their hearts. What kind
                                            of horrifying strength was required to do such a thing! As for that assassin
                                            who had attacked Zhou Weiqing, they might not know what cultivation level he
                                            was, but for a Heavenly Jewel Master to be able to fly with just his own
                                            body and without any Consolidated Equipment, that already proved a serious
                                            problem. Yet, even under such a situation, Zhou Weiqing had still succeeded
                                            in forcing his enemy to retreat. It was clear that when the assassin had
                                            fled, he had been severely injured.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, a massive shout rang out, reverberating through the skies.
                                            “PEERLESS THROUGH THE WORLD!” The two hundred Heavy Cavalry Soldiers had
                                            howled out with all their might without any prompting, draining off all the
                                            feelings in their hearts as they did so. With such a powerful Commander
                                            leading them, they were filled with even greater confidence.</p>
                                        <p>In midair, Zhou Weiqing’s wings slowly folded as he descended, landing on the
                                            ground. The tall, muscled body and brilliant scales, causing some of the
                                            Gold Crow Tribe female warriors to look at him with a glint in their
                                            eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er and Shangguan Xue’er rushed to Zhou Weiqing. They were far more
                                            familiar towards the powers and limits of Heavenly Jewel Masters, as
                                            compared to the Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers. Zhou Weiqing had indeed
                                            survived, but the sheer power he had burst out with, no matter in terms of
                                            defense and offense, that was already enough to rival that of a Heavenly
                                            King Stage powerhouse. That was definitely not normal, and for him to gain
                                            such strength in a short period of time, they knew it was not possible to
                                            not pay a heavy price.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at both girls with his strange eyes, one grey one red. As
                                            his spoke, his voice was clearly lower and hoarser than usual. “I’ll head
                                            back first. Ma Qun, Crow, retreat back to the city as well.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, the wings behind his back flapped hard, and his entire
                                            body warped into a purple light as he disappeared as well. None of the
                                            others had even seen how he had entered the city, that speed was no lower
                                            than the Heavenly King assassin just now.</p>
                                        <p>“Not good, let’s go back as well.” Shangguan Xue’er said softly to Tian’er.
                                            Both girls did not hesitate, quickly flying back towards the Crescent City
                                            as well. Currently, they no longer fought amongst themselves like normal,
                                            seemingly highly in sync.</p>
                                        <p>As the Peerless Heavy Cavalry headed back for the Crescent City victoriously,
                                            the three hundred citizens on the city walls had already been stunned by the
                                            series of events.</p>
                                        <p>They had witnessed the sheer power of the Peerless Heavy Cavalry with their
                                            own eyes. To them, these soldiers did not even seem human, as if they were
                                            divine soldiers descended from the heavens. Those Kalise Empire soldiers
                                            were scary enough to these commoners, and their numbers had surpassed the
                                            Peerless Cavalry many times over. Yet, in front of them, they had just
                                            seemed so weak and fragile. With such an army protecting the Crescent City,
                                            what was there to worry about?</p>
                                        <p>What followed next with the fight in the air was even more shocking to them.
                                            Although Zhou Weiqing’s fight with the Heavenly King assassin had happened
                                            at lightning speed, finishing in a short period of time, but in just that
                                            short process, the shock that it brought about was perhaps even stronger
                                            than that of the Peerless Heavy Cavalry. The changes in Zhou Weiqing’s body,
                                            the Heaven and Earth Anomaly, to ordinary people like them, it was like a
                                            miracle from the gods.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, they were at such a distance. From their perspective and
                                            knowledge, they could not tell that Zhou Weiqing had been at the
                                            disadvantage all the time. After all, at the speeds both had been fighting
                                            at, they could not see any details. All they knew was that finally Zhou
                                            Weiqing had sent the assassin flying with a single kick, and the enemy had
                                            fled.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, besides the shock on the three hundred citizens’ faces, there was
                                            no longer the fear which had been there previously. That had been replaced
                                            with excitement and joy. Le Zi laughed heartily, shouting out to them: “All
                                            of you have seen for yourselves. That is our Peerless Regiment Commander!
                                            That is the strength of our Commander, and our Peerless Regiment! I am not
                                            afraid to tell you all, all of us here are just merely the vanguard party.
                                            You all should know how many people a Regiment has, and they are all elite
                                            soldiers almost as strong as us. With us here, the Crescent City will be
                                            paradise on earth. No longer will you have to fear our enemies! Alright,
                                            that is all for today, you all are free to leave now. Remember to let your
                                            friends and families know about our Peerless Regiment and our strength. Our
                                            Commander has invited you here to witness our battles, so that you can
                                            dispel the fears and worries in your hearts. Now, you can see for
                                            yourselves, there is nothing to worry about right?”</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing’s plan and goal had been completed to
                                            perfection, far beyond all his expectations. When these three hundred
                                            citizens returned to their homes, the word would spread and the sheer
                                            increase in public opinion could be foreseen. However, while that part was
                                            successfully, Zhou Weiqing was currently in huge danger.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>As he dashed into his room, Zhou Weiqing abruptly crashed down on the ground.
                                            His entire body was shuddering violently, the red and black of his eyes
                                            appearing and disappearing in an unstable fashion, while each and every
                                            scale on his skin was trembling with a disruptive energy along with his
                                            movement.</p>
                                        <p>He felt an intense pain in his body, as if his entire innards were being
                                            shredded apart, far beyond even the previous time where he had been immersed
                                            in lava! Every single cell of his body screamed in agony, as if bits of him
                                            were being disintegrated inside.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, when he had entered the second stage of the Dragon-Tiger
                                            Transformation, he had felt his entire body heating up to a blazing
                                            intensity, as if he was filled with infinite strength. However, such a state
                                            only lasted for only ten seconds. That was to say, for the rest of the
                                            fight, especially that last kick that sent the Heavenly King assassin
                                            flying, he had already been in the midst of enduring such pain.</p>
                                        <p>As the heat dissipated, came the horrifying pain. However, with the endurance
                                            and willpower that Zhou Weiqing had trained from his years of cultivating
                                            the Immortal Deity Technique, and the time he had spent in the lava, only
                                            then had he managed to barely hold on, forcing himself to not give himself
                                            away as he flew back to the city as quickly as he could.</p>
                                        <p>He could not allow anyone else to see the current state he was in. Firstly,
                                            it was in case the Heavenly King assassin was hidden somewhere nearby, who
                                            knows if that fellow had really left. He did not want the assassin to be
                                            able to seize the opportunity to kill him. Secondly, he had spent so much
                                            effort in impressing all those citizens, a state that he could not allow to
                                            fail at the last moment. At last, he managed to hold on until he reached his
                                            room before he could no longer withstand it any longer, collapsing onto the
                                            ground as waves of pain rolled within him.</p>
                                        <p>The power of the Dragon and Tiger rampaged crazily inside his body.
                                            Originally, the dual energy had been balanced when he had achieved the
                                            Dragon-Tiger Transformation, but now they had gone berserk. If not for the
                                            layer of scales outside, perhaps the terrifying energy would have burst out
                                            of his body, destroying him totally. Pain… Pain!! It was not just his body,
                                            even his soul felt like it was being ripped apart. From below the scales,
                                            blood started to seep out all over his body, and the surface of the scales
                                            also began to change colour, growing dimmer… as if they were slowly in the
                                            process of disappearing. At this point, one could vaguely see that on Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s actual skin, there were shockingly cracks all over. His entire
                                            person looked like he was drenched in blood, and as the dragon tiger energy
                                            within his body raged all about… once the outer layer of scales disappeared,
                                            he could possibly implode and die.</p>
                                        <p>Having his inner potential burst forth like that before its time in a forced
                                            entry to the second state of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation might have
                                            seemed like a good thing, and it had certainly saved his life. However, that
                                            also meant that Zhou Weiqing’s body had to endure levels of energy that it
                                            could not handle… how could he not pay the price now? He had chased away his
                                            enemy, but now the problems he was facing could just lead to his death. At
                                            this moment, any Skill was useless… not any amount of healing. After all,
                                            the source of this was internal, from within to without, a far more chilling
                                            destructive capability.</p>
                                        <p>The intense pain had caused Zhou Weiqing to even lose his capability of
                                            thought, he could only lie down on the ground, trembling as the energy
                                            rocked his body, without the strength to even thrash around.</p>
