                                        <p>Fen Tian’s initial anger that filled his heart was about to erupt and could
                                            not be contained any longer. The Blood Red Hell powerhouses behind his back
                                            were also prepared to fight with full force at any time. However, who knew
                                            that the moment Zhou Weiqing landed onto the ground, he actually blamed him
                                            instead. </p>
                                        <p> “Don’t tell me you did not hear me saying I concede defeat?” shouted Fen
                                            Tian in anger.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and replied, “I heard it! However, my Deputy Sect Leader
                                            might not have heard it. The battle between the two Heavenly Emperors was
                                            very heated up and intense - both parties were attacking each other at full
                                            force. Do you think any of them would have noticed your yells from down
                                            below? If we were to let you go up to assist, who knows whether or not you’d
                                            attack our Deputy Sect Leader instead, out of revenge? So what’s wrong with
                                            me stopping you? Ultimately, it seems to me that the people of the Blood Red
                                            Hell are unskilled.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, Zhou Weiqing looked around at the powerhouses of the other
                                            Great Saint Lands and said righteously, “Everyone, are the lives of the
                                            Blood Red Hell cultivators exceptionally precious? The Passion Valley had
                                            lost a life earlier too, but what did Valley Master Huang say? Nothing at
                                            all. So why makes the Blood Red Hell so special that their people are not
                                            allowed to die? Furthermore, in the previous Grand Tournaments, was there a
                                            single tournament where there were absolutely no deaths at all? Isn’t it a
                                            normal phenomenon? If they really do have what it takes, the Blood Red Hell
                                            should send out someone stronger. If he manages to kill off my Deputy Sect
                                            Leader in a fair combat, I, the Sect Leader, will definitely have nothing to
                                            say.”</p>
                                        <p>Fen Tian had never wanted to kill someone that badly before - be it before or
                                            after he possessed the Destructive Attribute. At this moment, he truly
                                            wanted to disregard everything and ignore everyone else, and attack Zhou
                                            Weiqing and the Peerless Sect. Even if he were to dismember Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            body into several pieces, it would not dispel the hatred he had towards him!
                                            This little fellow was absolutely too repulsive - he distorted the truth and
                                            insisted he was right. </p>
                                        <p>However, Fen Tian could not do that right now. He had not achieved his
                                            objectives - it was not the right time to launch a full-on offensive attack.
                                            Furthermore, both the people of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain were looking at him in an unfriendly manner. </p>
                                        <p> “Alright, alright. Zhou Weiqing, Wu Yunyue, just you wait.” As he was
                                            yelling angrily, Fen Tian waved his hand violently, gesturing to his
                                            subordinates to retreat. He himself had also taken a few steps back to his
                                            original position. Naturally, some people from the Blood Red Hell went to
                                            pick up the bloodied corpse. At the same time, he nodded towards a short
                                            elder who had been standing continuously next to him. The elder slowly got
                                            up and walked out, joining the battle line without saying a single word,
                                            waiting for the Blood Red Hell’s next battle. </p>
                                        <p>Wu Yunyue had already continuously won back-to-back battles, and had killed
                                            off two Heavenly Emperors in succession. All of a sudden, the Peerless Sect
                                            had secured the upper hand in the tournament. </p>
                                        <p>However, in the next moment, Zhou Weiqing made a decision that nobody could
                                            understand. </p>
                                        <p> “We concede defeat in the next battle. The Deputy Sect Leader has won
                                            several battles. He deserves huge credit. Please go back to rest.”</p>
                                        <p>Even Wu Yunyue could not understand Zhou Weiqing’s rationale behind his
                                            decision. He sent a voice transmission to him and said, “Weiqing, I can
                                            still fight. Let me kill one more Blood Red Hell bastard before you take me
                                            out.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and looked indifferently at him. An invisible
                                            commanding pressure flashed across his eyes. </p>
                                        <p>Wu Yunyue took a deep breath and looked unhappily at the Blood Red Hell
                                            before returning to the Peerless Sect. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had his own plans - even though Wu Yunyue had recovered quite a
                                            lot of his energy earlier with his help, the current battles were the
                                            decisive ones. He did not want the Demonic Emperor to drain too much of his
                                            energy, Furthermore, he had other intentions.</p>
                                        <p>Perhaps, Xue AoTian could not see Zhou Weiqing’s rationale behind it, but
                                            Shangguan Tianyang managed to figure certain things out. To put it simply,
                                            if one were to look at the sequence of the battles, he would be able to
                                            figure it out. In the next cycle, the order was the Passion Valley, the
                                            Blood Red Hell and the Peerless Sect. That was also to say, the Passion
                                            Valley and the Blood Red Hell would have to fight first, and the winner
                                            would be the one going up against the Peerless Sect. Hence, if the Blood Red
                                            Hell wanted to inflict any harm or death to the people of the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain or the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, it would be a lot harder. This
                                            little fellow was practically too cunning and intelligent. </p>
                                        <p>The second person that Zhou Weiqing sent out had caused everyone to be taken
                                            aback. Long Shiya’s plump figured swayed as he slowly walked out and joined
                                            the battle line. Nobody had expected Zhou Weiqing to send the Six Ultimate
                                            Heavenly Emperor out after the Demonic Emperor. Without a doubt, in doing
                                            so, he had messed up the plans of all the other Great Saint Lands,
                                            especially that of the Blood Red Hell.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing returned to the Peerless Sect, remaining calm and collected.
                                            Shangguan Bing’er even gave him a chair to sit. Zhou Weiqing had arrogantly
                                            sat there, secretly laughing to himself:<em> Didn’t all of you experience
                                                the great presence of my master earlier? Great, I will let you think
                                                that the Peerless Sect had exposed our hidden trump. I’d like to see how
                                                you will deal with us.</em></p>
                                        <p>The tournament continued; Zhou Weiqing had gotten Wu Yunyue to forfeit the
                                            tournament, which is equivalent to the Peerless Sect losing that battle.
                                            Hence, the next battle was held between the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain’s second participants, the two Heavenly Kings. </p>
                                        <p>Initially, the two powerhouses were sent forth as cannon fodders. However,
                                            little did they expect the current situation to occur. When the two Heavenly
                                            Kings exchanged glances, there was an intense spark in their eyes. </p>
                                        <p>In this battle between the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain, even though their representatives were two Heavenly Kings, it was
                                            a rather intense battle. It seemed to be the longest battle ever since the
                                            tournament started. Ultimately, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s Heavenly King
                                            powerhouse defeated his opponent with the help of his Consolidated Equipment
                                            Set. However, he did suffer some minor injuries as well.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang had immediately announced that he wanted to forfeit the
                                            next battle. </p>
                                        <p>Two cycles had been completed thus far, since the tournament started. Apart
                                            from the Peerless Sect who had only one person who was disqualified, the
                                            other four Great Saint Lands had two people who were disqualified, and had
                                            to send in their third participant. </p>
                                        <p>The moment Shangguan Tianyang announced that he wanted his Heavenly King to
                                            forfeit the battle, Fen Tian’s pupils clearly contracted. Even though the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain had each gotten two
                                            of their participants disqualified, they were still at the back of the
                                            battle line. Moreover, they did not lose any of their members, unlike the
                                            Blood Red Hell that had already lost two Heavenly Emperors. Fen Tian had
                                            already started to sense something amiss, albeit just vaguely. </p>
                                        <p>The third cycle began - it was the battle between the Passion Valley and the
                                            Blood Red Hell. They continued to send out a Heavenly Emperor each.</p>
                                        <p>Without any suspense, it was clear who won the battle. The Blood Red Hell
                                            Heavenly Emperor managed to force his opponent to surrender within a very
                                            short period of time. It was a battle without any casualties. However, this
                                            Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor had to face the Six Ultimate Heavenly
                                            Emperor Long Shiya in the next battle. </p>
                                        <p>The Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor, that had just won the previous match,
                                            fell to the ground. He slightly tilted his head towards Fen Tian,
                                            communicating with his gaze. Fen Tian nodded his head slightly, seemingly
                                            indicating something. </p>
                                        <p>If the battles were not based on power but body weight, Long Shiya would
                                            definitely be at the top amongst all five Great Saint Lands’
                                            powerhouses.</p>
                                        <p>His body seemed to have become rounder and rosy; his rosy face clearly showed
                                            how healthy the state of his body was. He placed both hands behind his back,
                                            taking his time. </p>
                                        <p>The Blood Red Hell powerhouse snapped out of his thoughts and said in a deep
                                            voice, “Brother Long, after you.” As he spoke, took the lead and
                                            levitated. </p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya smiled; his plump body swayed slightly and he had already arrived
                                            within the sky. A layer of faint six-colored light appeared around his body.
                                            As his body soared into the sky, albeit indistinctly, a series of shadows
                                            could be seen behind him at the same time. </p>
                                        <p> “Huh?” Xue AoTian, who had been watching the battles in silence, couldn’t
                                            help but make a sound the moment he saw Long Shiya’s present appearance.
                                            Shock gradually filled his eyes. </p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing asked Wu Yunyue in a low voice, “Father-in-law, do you recognize
                                            the person that the Blood Red Hell sent out? From the looks of it, Fen Tian
                                            seems to view him highly.”</p>
                                        <p>Wu Yunyue nodded his head slightly, “His name is Devil Shen, the Deputy Hell
                                            Lord. He is one rank below Fen Tian.”</p>
                                        <p><em>Devil Shen?</em> Hearing that name, Zhou Weiqing immediately thought of
                                            Shen Little Demon, who he had defeated more than once. From the name, he
                                            could tell that Shen Little Demon was connected to this Devil Shen
                                            individual before his eyes.</p>
                                        <p><em>The Blood Red Hell’s Deputy Hell Lord? From the looks of it, Fen Tian
                                            cannot hold himself back any longer! </em></p>
                                        <p>After Devil Shen flew to an altitude of a thousand meters, he was not in a
                                            hurry to attack Long Shiya. Instead, he waited for Long Shiya to stop right
                                            before his eyes. </p>
                                        <p> “Brother Long, it’s been a very long time since we met, right? Is everything
                                            well with you?” Even though Devil Shen was the Deputy Hell Lord of the Blood
                                            Red Hell, he was older than Fen Tian - he was one of the biggest elders
                                            within the Blood Red Hell. He was of the same generation as Long Shiya; he
                                            was only a couple of years younger than Long Shiya. </p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya smiled and said, “Everything’s good. I managed to take in a good
                                            disciple in my later years. I’ve always been in a good mood.”</p>
                                        <p>Devil Shen replied, “If he was really a good disciple, he wouldn’t have
                                            dragged you into this mess. You don’t have a chance, just give up. It has
                                            been many years since you have been stuck at the Max Level Heavenly Emperor
                                            Stage, Brother Long. If you are willing to join the Blood Red Hell, perhaps
                                            I might have a way to help you break through the very last step.” </p>
                                        <p>It had been several long years since Long Shiya established a name for
                                            himself. Most importantly, he had always been a free cultivator in the past,
                                            or else Devil Shen wouldn’t have made that offer. Even though the
                                            requirement that Devil Shen brought up was simple, but he was very clear
                                            that to a Max Level Heavenly Emperor who had been facing a bottleneck for
                                            several years, the ability to make a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage
                                            was a huge temptation.</p>
                                        <p> “You have a way to help me make a breakthrough?” Long Shiya asked in
                                            shock.</p>
                                        <p>Devil Shen nodded his head and said, “I am at least 80% confident, Brother
                                            Long. I’m afraid you won’t have many more opportunities like these.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya chuckled. His smile, coupled with his plump body, made him look
                                            rich and contented. He did not look like one of the world’s top powerhouses
                                            at all. </p>
                                        <p> “Over the past few years, the Blood Red Hell people had been having a lot of
                                            fun. Perhaps it’s because of the Destructive Energy, right? The breakthrough
                                            method that you mentioned, is perhaps due to it as well?”</p>
