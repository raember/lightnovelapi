                                            before?”</p>
                                        <p>“You haven’t heard of the Heavenly Bow Unit?”</p>
                                        <p>“Yeah, I didn’t enter a military institute to study, nor did I go to a Jewel
                                            Master institute, so naturally I have never heard of them.”</p>
                                        <p>“The Heavenly Bow Unit is a legend in our Heavenly Bow Empire. In fact, in
                                            the past, our country was not known as the Heavenly Bow Empire, and it was
                                            because of the Heavenly Bow Unit and its merits that caused our country’s
                                            name change.”</p>
                                        <p>“Wow! That strong? Could it be that the Heavenly Bow Unit is even stronger
                                            than my father?”</p>
                                        <p>“I’m not sure about that, I have heard that there are only a few members in
                                            the Heavenly Bow Unit, but they are all top level godlike archers, and they
                                            can only be commandeered by His Majesty. There have been a few times in
                                            history when our country was in dire straits, and it was only because they
                                            took action, taking down some key members of enemy armies, that caused the
                                            tides to turn and saving us all. I’ve heard that their individual combat
                                            abilities might not be the strongest, but they are extremely skilled
                                            assassins that even Heavenly Jewel Masters have to fear.”</p>
                                        <p>“At that point in time, the Kalise Empire was at the peak of its power, and
                                            they had seven Heavenly Jewel Masters, while we only had Admiral Zhou alone.
                                            We were in deep danger, facing extinction, as the Kalise armies were at our
                                            very borders. However, in one single night, four of the strongest Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters on the Kalise side died under their bows. That caused the
                                            Kalise Army Commanders and their Emperor to panic and order the armies to
                                            retreat from the border, and in the next sixteen years up to now, they have
                                            never fully recovered from that time. It can be said that it was the seniors
                                            of the Heavenly Bow Unit which saved our very empire. If we are able to pass
                                            the test and actually join the Heavenly Bow Unit, that would be the greatest
                                            honour.”</p>
                                        <p>“So formidable? I really have to meet them!” Zhou Weiqing said excitedly.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p><i>Ten days later. </i></p>
                                        <p><i>Heavenly Bow City.</i></p>
                                        <p>After ten days of hasty travel, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er finally
                                            returned to the capital city. “Bing’er, where should we go to look for the
                                            Heavenly Bow Unit? When I left, my father did not give me any other
                                            instructions.” Zhou Weiqing asked as he looked high and low.</p>
                                        <p>Both were dressed in cloth attire, and while it was fine for Zhou Weiqing as
                                            his honest appearance did not cause him to stand out in the crowd, but
                                            Shangguan Bing’er’s beauty could not be hidden by even the simple clothing,
                                            and she was definitely still a head-turner. Luckily, Zhou Weiqing took
                                            prompt action, quickly handing her his large Wind Hat to over her face,
                                            slightly resolving the situation. Shangguan Bing’er said: “Admiral Zhou gave
                                            me a letter, and told me to open it when I reached Heavenly Bow City.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said curiously: “Well, let’s open it and see. By the way, do you
                                            want to come home with me later? Or should I go back with you?” [1. Moving
                                            so fast, my dear boy]</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er took out a letter from her bosom, and as she heard his
                                            words, she blushed: “Little Fatty, no, we’re still too small [2. 小 should
                                            usually mean young in this context, but it can also mean small, and I used
                                            it here because he puns with it in the next two paragraphs] … perhaps when
                                            we return from training in the Heavenly Bow Unit.”</p>
                                        <p>Traveling together these few days, Shangguan Bing’er had finally started to
                                            accept Zhou Weiqing a little, however our dear Little Fatty felt that he was
                                            still living a tragedy. In the past, Shangguan Bing’er always had a cold
                                            front towards him, and at least he didn’t dare have any untoward thoughts.
                                            However, now that the two of them had some relations, with his character,
                                            how could he not have some thoughts of being intimate with her. Alas,
                                            Shangguan Bing’er refused to be overly intimate with him due to his age, and
                                            the most she would do was to hold hands with him, or the occasional rare,
                                            quick embrace, causing Zhou Weiqing to itch in his heart, but he had no
                                            choice in the matter.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing turned his hot gaze to sweep across her body, muttering to
                                            himself: “Small? I don’t think that’s small at all! It’s just nice and
                                            perfect… hmm… probably 33 or 34C, at the age of sixteen, that’s a lot of
                                            latent potential…”</p>
                                        <p>“ZHOU … LITTLE… FATTY!” Shangguan Bing’er grabbed hold of his ear and
                                            twisted. “What are you saying??”</p>
                                        <p>“Ah? Nothing! I was uhh saying, that we aren’t that young, according to our
                                            country’s law, sixteen is of marriageable age. You are already of suitable
                                            age, and I’ve matured early as well!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er blushed again as she said: “Maturing early still doesn’t
                                            make it right. Little Fatty, I really am not prepared. I’ve lived along with
                                            my mom since I was young, and we depend a lot on each other, and her temper
                                            is not good. Can you wait at least 2 more years for me?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged helplessly: “Alright, I’ll listen to my wife dearest’s
                                            instructions.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er rolled her eyes at him, but seeing that he was listening to
                                            her also put her in a good mood, and she did not quibble about him taking
                                            advantage of her with his words. As she opened the letter in her hands, she
                                            saw that there was only one line written on it: “Go to the first level of
                                            the Di Hao Inn, and look for a drunkard called Luo Ke Di. Tell him this - ‘I
                                            am looking for the Liu of the Unparalleled Liu Duo.’ He will bring you to
                                            take the test to enter the Heavenly Bow Unit.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er passed Zhou Weiqing the letter for him to take a look as
                                            well, and they exchanged looks. The Di Hao Inn was a rather well known
                                            landmark in the Heavenly Bow City; it was six stories tall and was one of
                                            the largest, most well known inns in the entire city. The most interesting
                                            thing about the inn was that it catered to all walks of life, the higher the
                                            level of the inn, the higher the ranking and the price; as Heavenly Bow City
                                            citizens, they naturally knew the place.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er said: “I shall head home first to see my mother, let’s meet
                                            tomorrow at noon outside the Di Hua Inn alright?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing could not bear to part with her, and held on to her hand.</p>
                                        <p>A laugh slipped out of Shangguan Bing’er and she said: “Look at your foolish
                                            appearance.” She spread her arms and gave him an embrace, and just as she
                                            was about leave, she was hugged in return by Zhou Weiqing. Of course, he
                                            didn’t dare to go overboard, and just kissed her lightly on her
                                            forehead.</p>
                                        <p>Watching the Shangguan Bing’er as she vanished around the corner of the
                                            street, Zhou Weiqing regained his senses and headed back home as well.</p>
                                        <p>Admiral Zhou’s house was a manor with a relatively small courtyard, and the
                                            entire area was less than a thousand square metres, with around a dozen
                                            servants and without a single guard. If they didn’t witness it for
                                            themselves, no one would believe that the Heavenly Bow Empire’s commander in
                                            chief would have a house like that. However, Admiral Zhou had said that
                                            soldiers were meant to fight on the battlefield, and not as a guard.</p>
                                        <p>Even Emperor Di Feng Ling had brought up to Admiral Zhou about improving or
                                            expanding his manor, but he had always rejected it. In the empire, Admiral
                                            Zhou was one of the most respected persons, not just because he was the
                                            strongest person in the empire or the commander in chief of the army, but
                                            also because he was an extremely good role model. With a leader like that,
                                            how could the ranking officials in the Empire dare embezzle.</p>
                                        <p>“Mum, I’m home!” As soon as Zhou Weiqing entered the house, he shouted at the
                                            top of his lungs.</p>
                                        <p>“You little brat, you still know to come back! Did you hear that your father
                                            went back to the front lines, so you came running back? Come, let mommy see
                                            you, have been eating well? Are you thinner?” As soon as Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            shout resounded out, a voice cried out in reply, mixed with excitement, love
                                            and anger. From the inner courtyard, a lady walked out; it was Admiral
                                            Zhou’s wife, Zhou Weiqing’s mother.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s mother, Ling Zihan was not a great beauty, and could probably
                                            only be considered above average in terms of looks. She was a childhood
                                            friend of Admiral Zhou’s, and their love was very deep. Even after Admiral
                                            Zhou was famous, and he found out that his son’s meridians were blocked, he
                                            still didn’t bear to let his wife give birth to another child; from that you
                                            could see how much he loved his wife, and thus he did not marry again.</p>
                                        <p>“Mum!!” Seeing his mother, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but leap forward and
                                            give her a big hug.</p>
                                        <p>Ling Zihan was originally very angry with him for running away from home, but
                                            with that hug, most of the anger vanished. Lifting her hand to give Zhou
                                            Weiqing a knock on the head, she scolded: “You little brat, you think your
                                            wings are ready to spread? You actually dared to run away from home? Hmph,
                                            wasn’t it just looking at the princess bathe, how big a deal is that? Difuya
                                            that girl is your fiancee, what’s wrong with looking! Will she lose a piece
                                            of meat looking? Why did you run!?” If Shangguan Bing’er was here, she’d
                                            definitely be shocked by how doughty and intrepid Ling Zihan was.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said with a woebegone expression: “Wasn’t that because Dad was
                                            at home? If he weren’t at home, I wouldn’t have ran.”</p>
                                        <p>Ling Zihan gave a cold humph: “So what if he’s at home? As if he can beat you
                                            to death? When your father beats you, it’s for your own good. Every time he
                                            beats you, aren’t you still full of energy? Although you aren’t able to
                                            cultivate Heavenly Energy, but when he beats you, he always used Heavenly
                                            Energy to improve your body. If not for that, if that old fellow beat you
                                            for nothing, I would have dealt with him!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stared dumbfoundedly at his mother, only now did he know how
                                            much effort his father had spent on him, that even his beatings were not
                                            just to teach him, but to help him. All this while, although he knew his
                                            father loved him, he always thought his mum loved him more. However,
                                            listening to his mother’s words, he suddenly realised that his father’s love
                                            for him was no lesser, although he never expressed it out clearly. At that
                                            moment, the sudden shock, the sudden contrast in his heart, made him stand
                                            there in a daze, speechless. [3. Awwwwwwwwwww!!!]</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, a sudden clear and enraged voice sounded out from
                                            outside the manor. “Zhou Weiqing! Get out here right now!”</p>
                                        <p>The voice was extremely forceful, and gave Zhou Weiqing a fright; even Ling
                                            Zihan at his side was rather startled, after all the little brat had just
                                            returned home, how could someone find trouble with him so quickly? “What’s
                                            going on? Who’s that, you little brat?” Ling Zihan asked curiously.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s memory was very good, but he could not find any trace of such
                                            a voice in his memories, and he said with a puzzled face: “I do not know as
                                            well! Let me go out and see.” As he said that, he rushed out.</p>
                                        <p>The Zhou Family manor did not have any guards, and only had some servants,
                                            but in all the dozens of years the manor had stood there, this was the first
                                            time that someone had dared to shout and yell outside the Admiral’s Manor,
                                            even holding a scolding tone. All the servants within the compound were
                                            rather puzzled, wondering who it was who had such guts to come here looking
                                            for trouble.</p>
                                        <p>The Zhou Family Manor usually had its door open, and before Zhou Weiqing
                                            could exit, the owner of the voice had already entered.</p>
                                        <p>There were two people, and on sight of them, Zhou Weiqing’s heart
                                            clutched.</p>
                                        <p>It was two females, the one at the back was the person he had just parted
                                            with less than an hour ago, Shangguan Bing’er. At this moment, her face was
                                            full of worry, and her hands were being held by the woman in front, as if
                                            she had been dragged here.</p>
                                        <p>The woman holding onto Shangguan Bing’er seemed to be around 30 years of age,
                                            and if Shangguan Bing’er’s beauty were to be described as a little
                                            under-ripe, then this lady would be definitely in the prime of her beauty,
                                            the sort of striking looks that was usually peerless in a generation, that
                                            could even shake the spirit. Although her face was icy cold in anger, Zhou
                                            Weiqing couldn’t help but stare a little. Shangguan Bing’er and the lady had
                                            very similar features, and without question Zhou Weiqing knew who she
                                            was.</p>
                                        <p>“Who’s Zhou Weiqing? the middle aged lady asked coldly, her breathing was
                                            obviously ragged as if the sheer rage surrounding her was igniting the very
                                            air.</p>
                                        <p>“Aunty, how are you, I am Zhou Weiqing.” Zhou Weiqing did not dare hesitate,
                                            and quickly stepped forward, looking at her with his honest expression.</p>
                                        <p>“Who’s your aunty? You’re Zhou Weiqing? Good, I’ve been looking for you. Do
                                            you want to take your own life, or do you want me to take action
                                            personally?” When the middle aged lady looked at Zhou Weiqing, he felt a
                                            cold shiver run down his spine, as if his body was being pierced by two
                                            sharp swords.</p>
                                        <p>“Is there need to be so ruthless…?” Zhou Weiqing asked, dumbfounded.</p>
                                        <p></p>
