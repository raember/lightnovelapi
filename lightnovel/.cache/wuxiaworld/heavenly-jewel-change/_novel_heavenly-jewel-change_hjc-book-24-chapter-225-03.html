                                            waited for this day for such a long time. He hated Zhou Weiqing, hated him
                                            for stealing the heart of Xue’er from him. Not long ago, when Shangguan
                                            Xue’er had returned to the Heavenly Jewel Island, Zhan LingTian had realised
                                            something had gone wrong. That was because Shangguan Xue’er’s face had such
                                            a gentle expression. Furthermore, when she spoke with Fei’er about
                                            something, her face actually showed the youthful embarrassment of a young
                                            girl. Without question, that was not because of him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian was an extremely intelligent man, being one of the top geniuses
                                            in the entire younger generation, otherwise he would not have such high
                                            status in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. His associative imagination was
                                            definitely not weak at all, and after some devious roundabout questioning
                                            and tentative veiled references, he realised a shocking news. Zhou Weiqing,
                                            it was that Zhou Weiqing once more. He actually had such an unclear
                                            relationship with Fei’er and Xue’er as well! From that moment onwards, the
                                            fury and hate in Zhan LingTian’s heart burned bright.</p>
                                        <p>A few days ago, when Zhou Weiqing had ascended the Heavenly Jewel Island, he
                                            had already wanted to cause trouble for him. Alas, due to Shangguan
                                            Tianyue’s sudden appearance, he had not succeeded. However, today he had
                                            calculated that Zhou Weiqing would definitely be coming to the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace, and he had long since been waiting here. He wanted to defeat
                                            Zhou Weiqing, to prove that he was the stronger one, more worthy one. He was
                                            not reconciled at all!</p>
                                        <p>From a young age, he had always liked Shangguan Xue’er, and though the
                                            Shangguan Sisters had exact same features, the only one in Zhan LingTian’s
                                            heart was Xue’er. All these years, he had been training so hard, fighting
                                            with all of his might to gain a higher status in the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace. A big half of that reason was because of Shangguan Xue’er. Now,
                                            seeing the love of his life being stolen right in front of his eyes by
                                            someone else, how could he not be enraged?</p>
                                        <p>What so great about Zhou Weiqing… with his looks, how could he match Xue’er!
                                            Furthermore, he already had the love of Lady Bing’er!</p>
                                        <p>Towards Zhou Weiqing’s playboy ways, Zhan LingTian was extremely
                                            dissatisfied. As such, now that they were here today, he had made
                                            preparations to totally defeat Zhou Weiqing, letting him not have the face
                                            to stay on the Heavenly Jewel Island.</p>
                                        <p>Both men, filled with fiery passion and fighting for their love… clashing in
                                            that instant with dazzling fireworks.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian’s reactions were extremely fast; facing Zhou Weiqing’s charge,
                                            the Light-Dark Divine Spear piercing forward, totally ignoring Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s Dual Legendary Hammers as he made use of the length of the spear
                                            to aim directly at Zhou Weiqing’s throat. A thick Light Attribute and
                                            Darkness attribute energy exploded out, the two opposing Attributes causing
                                            a violent shockwave, the terrifying energy fluctuations bursting forth from
                                            the Light-Dark Divine Spear instantly, a concussive wave that spread out
                                            towards the Dual Legendary Hammers.</p>
                                        <p>Eight Jewels. Indeed, Zhan LingTian’s cultivation level had reached the
                                            eight-Jeweled stage. When he released the Light-Dark Divine Spear, his
                                            Heavenly Jewels had already told Zhou Weiqing his cultivation level.</p>
                                        <p>However, Zhou Weiqing did not change styles, instead using the Blink Still
                                            instantly. His Dual Hammers had already been smashing downwards, but with
                                            the aid of the Blink Skill, his body appeared abruptly right in front of
                                            Zhan LingTian.</p>
                                        <p>The Light-Dark Divine Spear swept to the side, and without warning Zhan
                                            LingTian’s body also moved to the side by three chi. Somehow, the Light-Dark
                                            Divine Spear was being used like a whip, slamming savagely into Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s hammers.</p>
                                        <p>A massive explosion, one so violent that almost the entire Heavenly Jewel
                                            Island could hear and even feel. The opposing forces and terrifying energy
                                            held within the Light-Dark Divine Spear exploded without any holding back.
                                            At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Legendary Hammers had been struck with
                                            all his strength behind it, also an equally terrifying power indeed.</p>
                                        <p>In the violent explosion, Zhan LingTian’s body staggered back a few steps. Of
                                            course, Zhou Weiqing did not fare much better, the Dual Legendary Hammers
                                            surrounded with gold and black light as he staggered back three steps as
                                            well, and he was forced to channel his Heavenly Energy to dispel the
                                            terrifying mix of Light and Darkness energies.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of just pure destructive power, the Light and Darkness fusion held
                                            an inherent explosive capability that was actually above any single Saint
                                            Attribute. That was Zhan LingTian’s strongest point. All his years of
                                            focusing on this area had allowed him to enter combat with these two
                                            attributes so easily, manipulating them at his beck and call. With the two
                                            terrifying energies merged together, it was more than enough to tear through
                                            any defenses of equal level.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, today he was facing Zhou Weiqing. Although Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation
                                            level was still no match for Zhan LingTian, in terms of pure strength, even
                                            two Zhan LingTians would be no match for him. With the five ‘Hate Ground no
                                            Handle’ Legendary Set pieces, his strength was already at a horrifying
                                            level. With his Heavenly Energy on top of that, even a Heavenly King Stage
                                            powerhouse would not dare to let him strike out at will so easily.</p>
                                        <p>As such, Zhan LingTian was also forced back in their clash. Similarly, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had been affected by the opposing energies of his Light-Dark Divine
                                            Spear… that was a pure union of Heavenly Energy and power of one’s
                                            attributes. However, even though the Light and Darkness Attribute’s Heavenly
                                            Energy reverberations were so tyrannical, when they met with the Saint
                                            Energy in Zhou Weiqing’s body, they vanished like snow in springtime.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian’s Light and Darkness Fusion Attribute was definitely extremely
                                            power, however in terms of power and the stage it was at, it was still far
                                            from the pure Destruction Attribute that the Blood Red Hell had used. Even
                                            the Destruction Attribute had fallen to the Saint Energy, let alone Zhan
                                            LingTian’s attack.</p>
                                        <p>Despite that, it was clear that Zhou Weiqing’s fighting capabilities were
                                            still greatly affected by it; at least not allowing him to swing a follow up
                                            attack quickly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhan LingTian staggered back in a cross step, feeling an aching and tingling
                                            sensation in his arms. Though his emotions were in great agitation, it did
                                            not stop his heart from gripping in shock from that exchange of blows. This
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s strength had already reached such a point? The pure strength
                                            he had was actually able to disregard the sheer gap between their power
                                            levels… This fight was not going to be easy at all.</p>
                                        <p>However, Zhan LingTian had never planned to underestimate Zhou Weiqing,
                                            having known him for a time. In fact, he even felt that in terms of Stored
                                            Skills, he was definitely no match for Zhou Weiqing. After all, Zhou Weiqing
                                            had six Attributes, with even two Saint Attributes. If he tried to compare
                                            Skills with him, he would definitely be at a disadvantaged position.</p>
                                        <p>As a result, even though his arms weren’t in top condition, Zhan LingTian
                                            still launched a follow up attack as soon as he could, his left leg stomping
                                            on the floor savagely as he soared into the air, the Light-Dark Divine Spear
                                            bursting into millions of gold and black threads of light, enveloping Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s body.</p>
                                        <p><i>Since your strength is so startling, then I will use pure combat skills to
                                            defeat you!</i></p>
                                        <p>Do not even think of underestimating these gold and black lights, each and
                                            every one of them held the fusion attribute of Light and Darkness. As long
                                            as they could pierce into their enemy, or met any obstruction, the
                                            protective layer around that energy would disappear, resulting in an
                                            explosion.</p>
                                        <p>Facing Zhan LingTian’s swift attack, Zhou Weiqing stood there, an icy cold
                                            look on his face. In that instant, the wings behind his back abruptly sprang
                                            wide open. On his Dual Legendary Hammers, bluish purple light burst out
                                            abruptly, the ‘Flying Lightning God Technique’ coming into play at once.</p>
                                        <p>It was clear that Zhou Weiqing’s ‘Flying Lightning God Technique’ was no
                                            match for Zhan LingTian’s Light-Dark Divine Spear. However, all Zhou Weiqing
                                            wanted was to stall him for a moment.</p>
                                        <p>When he had been knocked back from the clash earlier, Zhou Weiqing had not
                                            remained idle, instantly releasing the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation.
                                            It was only with the support of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation could
                                            he maintain such a high level of combat and expenditure of Heavenly Energy
                                            without too much problems. This was even more so since they were on the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Island, as the concentration of Heavenly Energy in the
                                            atmosphere was just so high, allowing the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation
                                            to work to its maximum effect.</p>
                                        <p>In the skies, a patch of crackling lightning that burst out like a angry
                                            roar. As countless lightning bolts crashed and exploded in air, dissipating.
                                            At this moment, a thick grey light sprang forth around Zhou Weiqing, warping
                                            into a strange layer of grey crystalline shield of light. He was actually
                                            attempting to purely defend against the Light-Dark Divine Spear that had
                                            just broken through his ‘Flying Lightning God Technique’.</p>
                                        <p><i>Looking for death! </i>That was the only thought in Zhan LingTian’s mind.
                                            A six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master was trying to block his Light-Dark
                                            Divine Spear’s Thousand Light Strikes with just a defensive skill? That was
                                            preposterous! After all, his Light-Dark Divine Spear was exactly specialised
                                            in piercing through defenses.</p>
                                        <p>However, that was just Zhan LingTian’s thoughts. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing had
                                            his own plans as well. As soon as he saw the light from Zhan LingTian’s
                                            spear about to land on him, the Dual Legendary Hammers swinging out as he
                                            totally ignored the incoming attack from Zhan LingTian. It seemed like he
                                            was going on an attack that would burn stone and jade alike [1. Direct
                                            translation, basically means killing an opponent in a suicidal type attack],
                                            directly striking at Zhan LingTian as well.</p>
                                        <p>By this point, it was already too late for Zhan LingTian to change his
                                            attacks. If that happened, he would lose his first strike advantage.
                                            Furthermore, he had already struck out with his full might, and if he tried
                                            to change attack now, he would have to suffer the backlash of changing and
                                            sustain an injury. As a result, he could only grit his teeth and push his
                                            offense to the greatest. To Zhan LingTian, as long as his attack could land
                                            on Zhou Weiqing and injure him, then it would also automatically ward off
                                            his attacks. Furthermore, the length of the Light-Dark Divine Spear was
                                            beyond the Dual Legendary Hammers.</p>
                                        <p>However, as the bouts of black and gold light began to land on the grey
                                            shield, Zhan LingTian’s expression changed.</p>
                                        <p>Bursts of energy and strange light began to spark upon the grey shield upon
                                            contact, but the Thousand Light Strikes which had already been weakened by
                                            the ‘Flying Lightning God Technique’ actually only caused the grey shield to
                                            ripple constantly upon impact, but did not seem to be able to break
                                            through.</p>
                                        <p><i>How was this possible?! What kind of powerful defense was that?! </i>Zhan
                                            LingTian’s heart was filled with shock. However, at this point he no longer
                                            had any other choice. Biting down hard, the thousands sparks of light
                                            suddenly gathered together, forming a single point as if warping into an
                                            extension of the Light-Dark Divine Spear, piercing forward as one.</p>
                                        <p>*Puuu* A soft sound, followed by a series of violent explosions in the
                                            air.</p>
                                        <p>The Ward of the Demon God had a truly startling defensive capabilities, but
                                            Zhan LingTian was no pushover. At last, with the merger of all the remaining
                                            Thousand Light Strikes and sheer power behind it, he had finally managed to
                                            break through the Ward of the Demon God, piercing towards Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            chest.</p>
                                        <p>“No!” Right at that moment, three female voices rang out at once. Both Zhan
                                            LingTian and Zhou Weiqing felt their hearts grip just as they were about to
                                            take action.</p>
                                        <p>However, by this time, neither of the two fighters could stop themselves.</p>
                                        <p>With the soft *Puuu* sound, Zhou Weiqing was pierced right through. However,
                                            it wasn’t his body, but his wings. At the last possible second, his wings
                                            had wrapped around himself, blocking in front of his body, forcefully
                                            blocking the Light-Dark Divine Spear. The actual spear had been blocked, but
                                            the energy held within the spear still managed to pierce through.</p>
                                        <p>A layer of black and gold light burst forth from Zhou Weiqing’s chest,
                                            traveling around his entire body. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing grunted in
                                            pain at the impact.</p>
                                        <p></p>
