                                            had certainly not expected it, and even the initiator of the Skill, Tian’er,
                                            had not expected it as well.</p>
                                        <p>For a Heavenly Jewel Master with the Divine Attribute to comprehend and gain
                                            the Faith (sub)Attribute, it was almost as rare as a Demonic Attribute
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master to have the Devour Skill. Of course, the difference
                                            was that the Demonic Attribute Devour Skill was an inborn talent, while the
                                            Divine Faith was something that had to be comprehended and grasped after
                                            cultivation.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, if not for the Saint Energy, Tian’er would most likely never be
                                            able to comprehend the profound mysteries of Faith, but she had already
                                            succeeded now.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of actual ‘usual’ practical applications or effectiveness, the
                                            Divine Faith definitely seemed to pale in comparison to the Devour Skill.
                                            However, under unique circumstances like this, the usefulness of the Divine
                                            Faith was far more terrifying than even the Devour Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er realised that their gain was not just the
                                            two hundred drops of Saint Energy each; even their Heavenly Energy had
                                            increased greatly. In fact, Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy had already been
                                            at the twenty fifth stage, although it had been for quite some time already,
                                            he had still been quite a distance from the twenty sixth stage. However, in
                                            just a matter of those few moments, he suddenly had a vague feeling of
                                            breaking through once more. Tian’er had pretty much the same sensation as
                                            Zhou Weiqing feeling was about the same, but due to the fact she was the one
                                            who had used the Divine Faith, the increase in Heavenly Energy was even
                                            greater for her. Previously, she had been at the first level of the
                                            seven-Jeweled stage, and in that short period of time it had reached the
                                            maxed level.</p>
                                        <p>However, this time, they could really not continue any longer. Although using
                                            the Power of Faith gained from the Divine Faith had given them so much in
                                            such a smooth fashion, the Power of Faith in their bodies was already packed
                                            to the brim. If they continued trying to absorb it, perhaps it would have an
                                            adverse effect or backlash. 0</p>
                                        <p>“Let’s go back.” Although the top eight fights had not ended, Zhou Weiqing
                                            could no longer wait. Both Tian’er and him needed to start cultivating as
                                            soon as possible to quickly transform all the energy they had just absorbed,
                                            and make it fully their own. Only at that time could they truly call all
                                            this energy their own.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er’s feeling was far deeper than Zhou Weiqing’s, and she quickly nodded
                                            without hesitation. Before the next fight even began, the Heavenly Bow
                                            Battle Team had stealthily left their Rest House, heading towards the
                                            inn.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as they reached their inn, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er quickly
                                            disappeared into their rooms.</p>
                                        <p>The other four team members, including Crow and Ma Qun, gathered together
                                            instead.</p>
                                        <p>“What happened in the ZhongTian Plaza just now? Does anyone know?” Ma Qun
                                            asked curiously.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst the four, the one with the widest experience and knowledge was
                                            definitely Yun Li, and the other three instantly turned to look at him.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li gave a bitter smile and said: “Don’t look at me, if I knew what was
                                            going on, it would be the stranger thing. That fellow Zhou Weiqing is just
                                            too disgusting, even his wife is just as disgusting as he is! In the past, I
                                            still thought that Lady Tian’er was mainly focused on supporting, who could
                                            have guessed… only today would we learn that her combat prowess is actually
                                            so strong, to such a shocking level. From the looks of things, perhaps even
                                            Zhou Weiqing cannot compare to her!”</p>
                                        <p>Crow nodded in firm agreement, saying: “Just now, that gold light was
                                            gathering from all around the entire ZhongTian Plaza, the sensation was
                                            truly shocking indeed. This is truly something that no one can confirm…
                                            perhaps only those with the backgrounds of the Great Saint Lands might have
                                            any idea of what that was.”</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun grinned and said: “Heh heh, no matter what, it is still our Boss’
                                            wife, the stronger she is, the better it is for us all! We have also managed
                                            to enter the top four already, and we can soon enter the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Island. Ahh, I wish we can hurry up and go up, I truly want to experience it
                                            for myself. Crow, didn’t you say there are many good things there? We have
                                            won quite some money this time, later you can go choose what you want, your
                                            beloved husband will buy it for you!”</p>
                                        <p>For the Heavenly Bow Battle Team side, they were relaxed and easygoing.
                                            However, no one noticed that as they left, the Dan Dun Battle Team had also
                                            left stealthily.</p>
                                        <p>There was one thing that Ma Qun had been correct. Only those from the Great
                                            Saint Lands could possibly recognize what Tian’er had unleashed.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er sat cross legged in a meditative position, their
                                            four palms held against each other. Naturally, the large Saint Energy
                                            whirlpool was necessary for their cultivation. No matter what type of
                                            cultivation they were undergoing, with the presence of the large Saint
                                            Energy whirlpool, it would bring a result of twice the result with half the
                                            effort.</p>
                                        <p>As their Heavenly Energy circulated around their bodies at a crazy speed
                                            under their control, they began cultivation in their own respective systems.
                                            As their Heavenly Energy crossed the path of the large Saint Energy
                                            whirlpool, the impurities in their Heavenly Energy were also swiftly
                                            stripped away, disintegrating in the power of the Saint Energy
                                            whirlpool.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, the smaller Personal Saint Energy whirlpool was also
                                            spinning swiftly. With the support of over two hundred drops of Saint
                                            Energy, the small whirlpool was clearly spinning at a much faster speed than
                                            before. Although it was still not able to form a proper full cycle that
                                            could generate Saint Energy by itself, as it slowly grew bigger, their own
                                            Heavenly Energy, bones, meridians, internal organs, almost every part was
                                            being strengthened slowly, bathed in the silver white light.</p>
                                        <p>Even for Zhou Weiqing’s body, which had evolved several times from the
                                            Dragon-Tiger Transformation, he could clearly sense that the Saint Energy
                                            was still slowly remoulding and improving his body. From this, one could
                                            imagine how powerful and overbearing the Saint Energy truly was.</p>
                                        <p>The twenty five energy whirlpools of the Death Acupuncture Points were
                                            spinning crazily, at such speeds that his internal senses and inward vision
                                            could not distinguish the actual frequency of the spinning. Subconsciously,
                                            he had already entered the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state, the wings
                                            behind his back unfurled as it crazily devoured the various atmospheric
                                            energies.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to Zhou Weiqing’s crazed speed in cultivation, Tian’er was much
                                            slower and stable. With the Divine Faith ability, all Tian’er needed to do
                                            was to allow the devout Power of Faith to course through her body, enriching
                                            her and improving her. Compared to Zhou Weiqing, her physique and body state
                                            was definitely much weaker. Of course, that was only compared to the
                                            monstrous Zhou Weiqing, who else could dare say they had a stronger physique
                                            or body than a top bloodline Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger? In the entire
                                            world, perhaps Zhou Weiqing with his Dragon-Tiger Transformation was one of
                                            the rare few had the right to do so.</p>
                                        <p>Comprehension and understanding had already dawned upon Tian’er when she had
                                            first gained the Divine Faith, and she could now clearly sense that with the
                                            Divine Attribute, she would definitely gain a lot from the Power of Faith.
                                            As long as she continued allowing herself to bath and soak in the Power of
                                            Faith, then her future cultivation bottlenecks that other ordinary Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters might meet would definitely be much smaller.</p>
                                        <p>As such, as compared to Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er did not rush to breakthrough.
                                            Do not just look on the surface of Zhou Weiqing’s Immortal Deity Technique
                                            and how it caused him so much pain or be on the verge of death all the time.
                                            However, it had also built up that steel clad will that he had, forging it
                                            in the fires of immense torture. The sheer toughness, strength and
                                            flexibility of his meridian channels and acupoints were also greatly
                                            improved through that. Although Zhou Weiqing was only at the six-Jeweled
                                            stage, his foundations were extremely stable, and with his physique, he did
                                            not need to worry about being able to withstand it at all.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s Immortal Deity Technique was split into four sections, and
                                            currently he was at the later stages of the third section. Amongst all four
                                            sections, the third section had the greatest amounts of Death Acupuncture
                                            Points, fourteen in total, and they were all Death Acupuncture Points in the
                                            chest area. Currently, there were still the last two remaining before he
                                            would finally complete the third section of the Immortal Deity Technique and
                                            reach the fourth stage.</p>
                                        <p>With a soft *Puuu* sound, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body shuddered. Tian’er could
                                            clearly sense the changes within him. He had broken through!</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the tacit understanding between Tian’er and Zhou Weiqing
                                            showed itself. Without any hesitation, without any prompting, she instantly
                                            stopped her own cultivation, fully sending her Heavenly Energy into the
                                            large Saint Energy whirlpool and allowing Zhou Weiqing to fully control and
                                            access the large Saint Energy whirlpool.</p>
                                        <p>The thirteenth chest Death Acupuncture Point, the Zhangmen Acupuncture
                                            Point.[1.<a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%AB%A0%E9%97%A8%E7%A9%B4">Zhangmen
                                                Acupuncture Point Baidu</a>]</p>
                                        <p>Position: Right at the median axillary line, at the front of the first costa
                                            fluctuantes ribs, at the point where the elbow would reach one’s body.</p>
                                        <p>Characteristics: The Liver Meridians, meeting the branch of the spleen
                                            meridian and jueyin meridian, considered the focal accumulation point of the
                                            abdomen front. Once struck, it would cause spleen and liver trauma,
                                            destroying the stomach muscles and even stalling blood flow in the area.</p>
                                        <p>The Zhangmen Acupuncture Point was one of the more important Death
                                            Acupuncture Points, and once attacked could definitely cause death swiftly.
                                            Breaking the ribs where the Zhangmen Acupuncture Point was would instantly
                                            puncture the liver as well.</p>
                                        <p>The Zhangmen Acupuncture Points on both sides of Zhou Weiqing’s body broke
                                            through almost instantly, and in that moment, the entire room was filled
                                            with a silver white light, shining brightly.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, the Saint Energy whirlpool which was only at Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Tian’er’s hands suddenly appeared outside, a massive silver-white whirlpool
                                            forming around the two of them entirely as it spun violently. The smaller
                                            Saint Energy whirlpool within Zhou Weiqing’s body also began to spin faster
                                            and faster, and his entire body, including his wings, were stained a
                                            silver-white colour.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing began to shudder violently, but it only lasted the time to take
                                            three breaths before he stopped, the expression and colour of his face
                                            returning to his normal calm. Vaguely, one could observe that all of his
                                            currently open Death Acupuncture Point, there was an energy whirlpool
                                            swirling around with the Saint Energy from the air, starting to turn a
                                            silver white colour.</p>
                                        <p>Including the freshly opened two Zhangmen Acupuncture Points, one left and
                                            right, became part of this whirlpool. At the same time, the Heavenly Energy
                                            reverberations that Zhou Weiqing was giving off was obviously
                                            increasing.</p>
                                        <p>To complete such a massive breakthrough of the Immortal Deity Technique, and
                                            at such a fast pace, allowing his cultivation level to increase
                                            dramatically… all of this, Zhou Weiqing had not dared to imagine. Although
                                            the pain of breakthrough was still extremely intense, it had only lasted for
                                            such a short time before the Zhangmen Acupuncture Point had completed its
                                            transformation. This was definitely the contribution of the Saint
                                            Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Everytime Zhou Weiqing opened a new Death Acupuncture Point, his entire
                                            Heavenly Energy circulation would flow smoother and swifter, and each of the
                                            individual energy whirlpools of the respective Death Acupuncture Points
                                            would also have slight changes. Currently, he could clearly sense that when
                                            his Heavenly Energy had burst in such an increase, all of the silver white
                                            light of his meridian channels had grown stronger, especially that of his
                                            energy whirlpools in the Death Acupuncture Points. At the same time, the
                                            amount of Saint Energy in his own personal Saint Energy whirlpool had
                                            dropped by a hundred drops!</p>
                                        <p>After discovering this situation, Zhou Weiqing was not startled or afraid,
                                            instead feeling overjoyed. He knew that this could only be a good thing for
                                            him. Having the Saint Energy fully infused into the Immortal Deity Technique
                                            meant that it would be able to support the cultivation of his Immortal Deity
                                            Technique, further improving his speed of cultivating Heavenly Energy. If he
                                            could, he would even be willing to infuse all of his Saint Energy into all
                                            of his Death Acupuncture energy whirlpools.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, that was not possible at all. After some testing, Zhou Weiqing
                                            quickly discovered that he was unable to accomplish that.</p>
                                        <p>After gaining the Saint Energy, this was the second time that he had broken
                                            through in his Heavenly Energy stage. The previous time he had broken
                                            through, both he and Tian’er still had very little Saint Energy. This time,
                                            they had far surpassed the hundred drop mark, and he had a totally fresh and
                                            new sensation. After a few tries, Zhou Weiqing realised what it was.</p>
                                        <p>In order to allow the Saint Energy to fully merge into his Death Acupuncture
                                            Points permanently, it could only be accomplished in that single instant
                                            when his Heavenly Energy was breaking through, right as the Immortal Deity
                                            Technique was taking the next step and breaking through one of his Death
                                            Acupuncture Points.</p>
