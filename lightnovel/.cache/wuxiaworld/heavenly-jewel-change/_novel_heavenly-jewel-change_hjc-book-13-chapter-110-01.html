                                        <p>As one’s cultivation level grew, each and every level of Heavenly Energy was
                                            undoubtedly tougher to reach, and the next level would always take a greater
                                            amount of Heavenly Energy. Zhou Weiqing’s original estimation of ten days
                                            was not fulfilled, and it took him an additional twenty three days on top of
                                            the thirty seven days spent with the three Masters, before he finally
                                            reached the breakthrough point once more.</p>
                                        <p>Without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing immediately began his final burst towards
                                            breaking through.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, despite his ‘mistreatment’ of himself, his body and physique
                                            was not weak at all. After all, Heavenly Energy was the atmospheric energy
                                            that all Heavenly Jewel Masters needed and absorbed, and was in itself
                                            extremely good for the human body. Just this energy alone was able to
                                            sustain a Heavenly Jewel Master for a long period of time without much
                                            problems; although it wasn’t the same as Tian’er being able to live without
                                            food and drink, it was still able to keep one alive for some time without
                                            issues.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued cultivating non-stop; although this type of
                                            cultivation would place a large toll on his body, at the same time, as the
                                            saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. As long as he managed
                                            the get through this without any long term damage, it would actually have a
                                            sort of tempering effect on his body as well.</p>
                                        <p>The twenty three days had passed, and currently Zhou Weiqing’s body was
                                            actually stronger and tougher than before, and his Heavenly Energy much
                                            thicker. However, he was facing with another huge problem - his spirit.</p>
                                        <p>After twenty three days without sleep and rest, furthermore with full
                                            concentration on cultivating, it had already exhausted his spirit to the
                                            point of breakdown.</p>
                                        <p>Normally, over twenty days of cultivation was nothing for a Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master; after all, cultivating was a sort of rest in itself. However, Zhou
                                            Weiqing was different. He was making use of the Devour Skill to its maximum
                                            before cleansing and absorbing the Heavenly Energy gained. Under such a
                                            circumstance, with his body at the risk of having problems at any time, he
                                            had to fully concentrate on not just the Skill, but also in the cleansing
                                            and absorption process. Only then could he ensure that he could properly
                                            absorb all the Heavenly Energy without future issues.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, this also took a large toll on his spirit, with only a
                                            slight rest at the ending part of each cultivation cycle, which was
                                            definitely not sufficient considering how much he expended. If not for that
                                            stubborn conviction in his mind supporting him, he would have collapsed long
                                            ago.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, under such a circumstance, when Zhou Weiqing felt that his Heavenly
                                            Energy was already sufficient, he steeled his resolve and chose to
                                            breakthrough the next Death Acupuncture Point.</p>
                                        <p>*BANG*-- The sixteenth Death Acupuncture Point broke instantly. Under the
                                            tremendous pain, Zhou Weiqing lost control of his body almost immediately
                                            due to the resulting involuntary violent shaking. However, he still managed
                                            to force himself to focus his spirit in full concentration. Currently, his
                                            mind was fixated with the faces of his mother, father, and all the kinsmen,
                                            friends, and teachers in the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p>
                                        <p>Tears flowed down his face once more. In his mind, he vowed. <i>Mother,
                                            father, you must stay alive, you must! Wait for me please, I will definitely
                                            take revenge for all of you, and revive the Heavenly Bow Empire!</i></p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing knew that the possibility of survival for his parents
                                            were almost zero, unless he actually heard reports of their demise, he would
                                            hold that hope deep in his heart.</p>
                                        <p>That day, when he had sat there in his room alone, he had been filled with
                                            despair. He understood his father’s character all too well. With his
                                            father’s cultivation level, it would have been extremely easy for him to
                                            escape… if he wanted to. However, he knew that his father would not do such
                                            a thing. His father’s temperament was such that he would stay til his last
                                            drop of blood, never leaving such a battlefield, and would rather choose to
                                            die with his soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>What about his mother? What would his mother do? Zhou Weiqing was also clear
                                            that his mother would definitely stay by his father’s side, no matter how
                                            much protection she got, as soon as his father died, his mother would soon
                                            follow suit.</p>
                                        <p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing’s heart had only one wish, that his father was
                                            in front of him, even if he were beating him like he was young, no matter
                                            how hard, or scolding him… All he wanted to see was his father’s old
                                            fashioned, stubborn and strict face.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, all of that was just too far from his… perhaps for forever.</p>
                                        <p><i>Father, mother, if both of you are dead, I will definitely let the Kalise
                                            Empire and the Bai Da Empire pay a hundred, a thousand times! Please,
                                            father, mother, wait for your Little Fatty to come back!</i></p>
                                        <p>It was just because he had already the worst possibility in mind, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had decided to stay back. At a mere three-Jeweled cultivation level,
                                            he knew that he would be useless against an army. The only thing he could do
                                            was the seize this opportunity in the Heavenly Jewel Island, to boost his
                                            cultivation level as much as he could in a short period of time, and gain
                                            some extra Skills in their Skill Storing Palace, before returning to the Fei
                                            Li Empire to plan his next step. That was the best thing he could do.</p>
                                        <p>Having forced himself to calm down and live with that despair, Zhou Weiqing
                                            could make that best choice. He had already thought about his next few
                                            possible steps - naturally, it would not be possible for him to continue
                                            staying at the Fei Li Military Academy until graduation. As soon as he
                                            returned to the Fei Li Empire, he would have to find out exactly what
                                            happened to the Heavenly Bow Empire and the current status. After that, he
                                            would have to find a path to tread; perhaps a path that had not been in any
                                            of his previous plans, or perhaps one that he had not planned to step on
                                            just so soon.</p>
                                        <p>As the saying goes, an oppressed army fighting with desperate courage is sure
                                            to win. When one is pushed to the edge, even a rat will fight with an
                                            immeasurable courage. Even though Zhou Weiqing’s spirit was at the verge of
                                            breaking down, his sheer stubborn will, that infinite yearning for his
                                            family and friends, allowed him to somehow persevere through everything.
                                            Gritting his teeth through everything, it was only until that broken through
                                            sixteenth Death Acupuncture Point had finally been sealed back and the
                                            energy whirlpool formed, and the fourth Jewel forming around his wrists,
                                            signalling his success… only then did he finally faint, fully exhausted.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing remained fully unconscious for three days and three nights, and
                                            by the time he awoke once more, he found that he was in his room in the
                                            inn.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er was sitting there silently by his bed, and when she saw him rouse
                                            from his sleep, she stroke his face softly and said gently: “Wait here, I
                                            will get something for you to eat.”</p>
                                        <p>She did not try to persuade him; at this point, it was useless to say
                                            anything. Tian’er knew that the only thing she could do was to accompany him
                                            and to support him. That would be the best help she could offer. At least,
                                            until he fully calmed down.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s spirit and consciousness slowly recovered, and with a quick
                                            thought, started circulating his Heavenly Energy around his body, and the
                                            sixteen energy whirlpools started spinning faster. A layer of shimmering
                                            white light seemed to seep out from his body; it was the newly improved
                                            Immortal Deity Shield.</p>
                                        <p>With his sixteenth Death Acupuncture Point broken through, both his wrists
                                            showed the fresh new Jewel each. Under normal circumstances, Zhou Weiqing
                                            would need at least three months more to breakthrough to this stage, but he
                                            had forcibly accomplished it by risking his health and life.</p>
                                        <p>Four Jewels. That was also stepping up from the Shi Stage to the Zun Stage,
                                            from the Upper Level Shi Stage to the Lower Level Zun Stage. This was not an
                                            extremely tough bottleneck, but to someone like Zhou Weiqing who used such a
                                            method of cultivation, it was indeed another life and death trial.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er returned to the room, carrying a bowl of meat porridge. Receiving the
                                            bowl from her, Zhou Weiqing gulped it down swiftly with large mouthfuls. He
                                            was an intelligent person after all, and even though he had suffered such a
                                            massive blow, this nigh-suicidal training to him was also a sort of venting.
                                            That did not mean he would relax or feel happy, but at least it aided in
                                            stabilizing his emotions.</p>
                                        <p>Swiftly gobbling up the entire bowl of porridge, Zhou Weiqing turned to
                                            Tian’er and said: “Thank you, Tian’er.” Seeing her rather haggard, exhausted
                                            face, a look of apology appeared on his face.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er shook her head slightly and said: “There is no need to thank me.
                                            Congratulations on breaking through to the four-Jewel Stage.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly and said: “There is still a long way to go.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er kept silent for a while, before finally asking him: “When do you plan
                                            to leave?”</p>
                                        <p>A sorrowful light flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, and he said: “Alas, by now,
                                            the dust has already settled in the Heavenly Bow Empire… and it is too late
                                            to just react foolishly. I will take a few more days to complete my fourth
                                            Jewel’s Skills, then I will leave for the Fei Li City.”</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er nodded silently, then said: “Rest a while before you go. If anything
                                            happens to you, there will be no more chances left for the Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing forced a smile onto his face and said reassuringly: “I am fine,
                                            the earlier I return, the earlier I can arrange other things as well. Do not
                                            worry, I will be alright.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he stood up to leave, planning to head once more to the
                                            Skill Storing Palace to complete Skill Storing on his Fourth Jewel.</p>
                                        <p>However, this time, Tian’er did not let him do as he wished. Standing up
                                            abruptly, she grabbed hold of Zhou Weiqing’s arm. As he started in surprise,
                                            Tian’er had already wrapped both arms around his neck, standing on tiptoe as
                                            she kissed him on the lips suddenly.</p>
                                        <p>As their lips met, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes widened as they lost focus in shock.
                                            Tian’er pressed her body closer, her voluptuous, fiery hot body seemed like
                                            a body of molten lava, melting Zhou Weiqing down.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er exerted some pressure on her feet, and Zhou Weiqing lost his balance.
                                            Almost instantly, both of them fell onto the bed, with Tian’er on top.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, her face was totally red, her entire person like a beautiful ripe
                                            peach as she pressed down against Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Their lips parted, and Zhou Weiqing stared in shock at her. Tian’er’s
                                            breathing was urgent, and she murmured softly: “I said that I would give you
                                            a reward for saving that dragon family… And I’ll give it now…”</p>
                                        <p>“Tian’er…” Zhou Weiqing only had time to cry out once, before his lips were
                                            once again sealed with another kiss.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stared at her with wide eyes. Currently, all he could see in her
                                            eyes was a deep purple, and in a flash, he felt a sense of relaxation, and
                                            the sensations of his body felt magnified.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er’s kisses were very clumsy, but searing hot. In terms of her figure,
                                            amongst all the girls that Zhou Weiqing knew, she was definitely the most
                                            voluptuous, and perhaps only Principal Cai Cai could come close. However, in
                                            terms of the wild nature of the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger, none could
                                            compare.</p>
                                        <p>A wild, ferocious aura overwhelmed him, and Zhou Weiqing felt as if his
                                            entire body was being melted down by Tian’er. However, he was no longer a
                                            virgin, and after a short moment of stunned shock, a violent desire mixed
                                            with pain rose within, and he hugged Tian’er hard. A red light rose within
                                            his eyes again, and the temperature of his body rose rapidly, as if ignited
                                            by Tian'er.</p>
                                        <p>Tian'er's eyes closed slowly. Currently, she was both excited and afraid,
                                            almost flustered. Although she knew what she wanted, in truth she did not
                                            know what she was doing. Towards the relations between men and women, she
                                            did not know much, with most of her knowledged learned from her peeking at
                                            Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er’s intimate relations.</p>
