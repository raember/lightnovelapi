                                            Zhou Weiqing was saying. A cold light flashed in her eyes. In an instant,
                                            the beautiful and seductive young lady became an ice cold lady filled with
                                            killer intent, a wintry aura locking onto Zhou Weiqing’s body.</p>
                                        <p>Without warning, her right hand flashed out towards Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            throat.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s reaction was not only quick, but straightforward and extremely
                                            effective. Both hands shot forth ahead in a claw shape, savagely moving
                                            forward.</p>
                                        <p>It had to be known that Zhou Weiqing was after all at a height of 1.9 metres,
                                            while Ming Hua was barely 1.7 metres or so, such a height advantage as well
                                            as advantage in terms of reach was without question. As such, before Ming
                                            Hua’s hands could reach him, his hands would reach her first, and would
                                            reach the… 35.5...</p>
                                        <p>As soon as both sides started the fight, Zhou Weiqing used the Ultimate
                                            Master Skill he had learnt from Mu En - the ‘Breast Grabbing Dragon
                                            Claw’.</p>
                                        <p>“Shameless!” Ming Hua’s face was totally red. Although she looked coquettish
                                            and seemed to be seductive, she was actually a virgin. When her so-called
                                            seduction arts met with Zhou Weiqing’s scoundrel ways, she naturally lost
                                            out.</p>
                                        <p>However, Ming Hua’s reactions were quick and effective as well. Her body
                                            twisted in mid charge, moving to the side like a slippery eel, almost
                                            brushing past Zhou Weiqing’s arms and slipping through in the middle. Like a
                                            bolt of lightning, she shot past him and her hands were almost at Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s throat.</p>
                                        <p>Just as that moment, the expression on Ming Hua’s face suddenly changed, and
                                            her hands, which were just at Zhou Weiqing’s throat, suddenly struck
                                            downwards. With a soft muted *Bang*, Ming Hua’s body flew up into the
                                            air.</p>
                                        <p>What happened was that when Ming Hua had slipped past his arms, Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s right leg had already lifted up to strike without any sound, and
                                            at the same time his body leaned backwards. If Ming Hua had continued with
                                            her strike, her abdomen would have impacted right into Zhou Weiqing’s knee.
                                            With the abdomen being one of the weaker spots in the human body, being
                                            struck there with a knee, it was definitely not a worthwhile exchange for
                                            her. However, Ming Hua’s reactions and flexibility was unbelievably quick,
                                            and in such a short span of time, she had managed to once again change her
                                            style of attack. As she leapt up into the air, her knee also struck forward
                                            towards Zhou Weiqing’s head.</p>
                                        <p>This was one of the strongest points about a Flexibility Attribute Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master, any part of their bodies could be a weapon. Without a doubt,
                                            the pure strength type Zhou Weiqing could not compare in terms of body
                                            agility and flexibility with Ming Hua. However, the toughness of his body
                                            was also not something that any normal strength type Heavenly Jewel Master
                                            could compare to. Caught off guard and seeing that he was not likely to be
                                            able to dodge Ming Hua’s knee, Zhou Weiqing grinned and did not even attempt
                                            to do so, instead whipping his head to the front like a hammer, smashing his
                                            forehead against Ming Hua’s knee.</p>
                                        <p>Another muted *Bang* sounded out as they struck each other, and Ming Hua’s
                                            body somersaulted in the air, her right leg landing on Zhou Weiqing’s back
                                            and she used it to shove herself forward, instantly widening the gap between
                                            them by over a dozen yards.</p>
                                        <p>Being struck on the back, Zhou Weiqing also stumbled a few steps before
                                            recovering. Grinning widely, he moved his head about, stretching his neck
                                            muscles. “Beautiful lady, are you giving this brother a massage?”</p>
                                        <p>Earlier, Ming Hua’s leg had struck his Life Gate Acupuncture Point, it could
                                            be said to be an unbelievably accurate sniping strike. She was after all a
                                            Lower Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, with four sets of Jewels. Even
                                            though her Physical Jewel was the Flexibility boost, her strength was still
                                            far beyond ordinary. According to her expectations, that kick of hers should
                                            numb Zhou Weiqing’s entire body, or perhaps even paralyse him
                                            momentarily.</p>
                                        <p>However, when her kick landed, she instantly felt something was wrong, as if
                                            she was kicking a metal board, with her Heavenly Energy released in that
                                            kick seemed to be dissipated instead. Furthermore, her other knee was
                                            actually hurting so much from the impact with Zhou Weiqing’s forehead, the
                                            burning pain actually affecting her later performance. This time, although
                                            it seemed as if she held the upper hand in their quick  clash, she had
                                            definitely suffered a little.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the knee which had struck Zhou Weiqing was still hurting
                                            badly, obstructing her ability to fight well. Yet, Zhou Weiqing seemed like
                                            he was totally fine, still able to tease her.</p>
                                        <p>“Not bad, not bad indeed. No wonder my big brother admired you so much.” Ming
                                            Hua said coldly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing immediately gave a look of fear. “Admire me? Oh no, that will
                                            not do! I do not like men, I only love my dear Bing’er.”</p>
                                        <p>“You…” Ming Hua was so angered by him that her face almost turned green.
                                            Lifting her left hair, a green light shot out and shone upon her knee.
                                            Instantly, her right leg was restored to its uninjured state.</p>
                                        <p>Upon seeing that, both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er were shocked, their
                                            pupils contracting in surprise as they shouted out almost at the same time.
                                            “Life Attribute Elemental Jewel.”</p>
                                        <p>Originally Zhou Weiqing had thought that Ming Hua’s Elemental Attributes
                                            would be the same as her brother - Light. However, it was clear now that he
                                            had guessed wrongly. What Ming Hua had was actually one of the four greater
                                            attributes, in fact the rarest one amongst the four - Life Attribute. It had
                                            to be known that all Life Attribute Jewel Masters were like precious
                                            treasures which all various powers tried to get. In a battlefield, having a
                                            Life Attribute Jewel Master would greatly increase the survivability of all
                                            companions.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing cried out in surprise, Ming Hua moved once more. This
                                            time, she was even faster than her previous attack. With a lift of her right
                                            hand, a sharp spike appeared in her palm. Not only that, the four Waxy Jade
                                            Jewels around her right wrist actually all lit up! In a swirl of light, her
                                            entire right arm glowed with a pale green light as it was entirely covered
                                            by a layer of armour which was glowing and covered with plant like tattoos,
                                            seeming to merge and fuse together with the 3 chi long spike in her hand. At
                                            the same time, a breastplate, shoulder pauldrons, waist guard, and right
                                            legplates. Including the right armguard, it actually covered five parts of
                                            her body!</p>
                                        <p>This time Zhou Weiqing was even more shocked as he cried out: “Consolidated
                                            Equipment Set!” Indeed, without question, Ming Hua was using a Consolidated
                                            Equipment Set, and furthermore it was likely to be about at least a 6 piece
                                            set. It already covered much of her body with only four Jewels, and it was
                                            likely to be complete just after 2 more pieces, and was even better than
                                            Feng Yu’s set.</p>
                                        <p>On close examination, one would be able to notice that her four Jewel’s
                                            respectively Consolidated the spike weapon, breastplate and waistguard as
                                            one, right armguard and shoulder pauldrons as one, and legguard as one. The
                                            only things missing were the left armguard and left legguard. If there was a
                                            helmet piece, then it would be a 7 piece set!</p>
                                        <p>For Consolidated Equipment Sets like that, it required at least a Zong Stage
                                            Consolidating Equipment Master to be able to create the scrolls.
                                            Furthermore, to create such a set of scrolls, it would need at least five to
                                            ten years of effort. Such a Consolidated Equipment was truly priceless,
                                            especially since it could be seen from the breastplate alone that this was
                                            designed and made specially for Ming Hua, with the many small ‘scales’ of
                                            the armor causing it to be flexible, and it would definitely not obstruct
                                            her Flexible fighting style. At the same time, on the breastplate, pauldrons
                                            and arms, sockets could be seen on these individual pieces of Equipment.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing such a high end piece of Consolidated Equipment almost did give Zhou
                                            Weiqing a big scare. Although Ming Hua had not completed it fully yet, with
                                            four pieces she was already able to make use of some of the set equipment’s
                                            effects.</p>
                                        <p>With her Consolidated Equipment set, Ming Hua’s speed, strength and overall
                                            physique was improved manifold. Like a bolt of green lightning, she
                                            instantly appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing, and with a quick twist and spin
                                            of her soft body, the spike in her hand struck towards Zhou Weiqing’s right.
                                            At the same time, her body spun and her armored right leg struck out towards
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s lower body. Such savage and precise blows were indeed
                                            impressive.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Ming Hua’s cultivation level was already higher than Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s. Now that she was wearing her entire Consolidated Equipment Set,
                                            how could Zhou Weiqing begin to even deal with her attacks which seemed to
                                            come from every possible direction.</p>
                                        <p>In a flash of silver light, Zhou Weiqing was forced to use the Blink skill in
                                            order to evade her attacks. At the same time, his right leg lashed out
                                            towards her.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua gave a cold humph as she said: “I know there is something strange
                                            about your right leg.” She did not try to exchange direct blows with Zhou
                                            Weiqing, instead making use of her flexibility to spin and weave around him.
                                            It was as if she was a sticky rice cake, steadily glued to him and he could
                                            not shake her off no matter what he tried, indeed an unbearable feeling.</p>
                                        <p>In the distance, Shangguan Bing’er was watching nervously. In her hands, she
                                            grasped the bow that Hua Feng had given her, ready to give assistance at any
                                            time if things looked really bad.</p>
                                        <p>With the increase in speed, power and physical attributes of Ming Hua, the
                                            spike in her hands was of great threat to Zhou Weiqing. Even with the
                                            Immortal Deity Shield protecting him, Zhou Weiqing did not dare allow the
                                            sharp spike to touch his body.</p>
                                        <p>Forced into a corner, Zhou Weiqing resolutely lifted up his left hand. As he
                                            waved it downwards, there was a ripping sound as the air itself was torn
                                            apart and a strong suction force appeared alongside the terrifying black
                                            tear that signified the Spatial Rend. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing quickly
                                            used the opportunity to instantly move back, holding some distance between
                                            Ming Hua.</p>
                                        <p>Her eyes narrowed and contracted as she saw the strange sight before her
                                            again. Although her attack was blocked, she swiftly reacted in a much
                                            swifter and more ingenious method as compared to Zang Lang. Her body quickly
                                            dipped in a downward motion, her entire set of Consolidated Equipment
                                            glowing in a thick green light, managing to swiftly dodge it and also
                                            dissipate most of the suction force from the Spatial Rend. Just like that,
                                            she kept low and close to the ground as she bounded towards Zhou Weiqing.
                                            With a swift uppercut, the sharp spike once again struck forward towards
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s leg.</p>
                                        <p><i>This woman is really just too hard to deal with!</i> The feeling of having
                                            power but being unable to use it properly as if his limbs were bound caused
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s anger to rise as well. He wasn’t able to continuously release
                                            the Spatial Rend; although the skill was extremely powerful, it was also a
                                            huge drain on his Heavenly Energy and his own spirit. Furthermore, it had
                                            more than a ten second cooldown timing, as compared to the 3 second of
                                            Blink. Seeing that he was once again unable to dodge Ming Hua’s attack, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had no choice but to use his Blink skill once more, as it had just
                                            come off cooldown. In a bright flash, he once again appeared at the other
                                            side, only then managing to barely escape her attack.</p>
                                        <p>“Hmph. I want to see if you can keep using the Blink to escape forever!” Ming
                                            Hua seemed like a green faery; although Zhou Weiqing was quick to escape,
                                            her attacks seemed to be just as fast and relentless. It was as if she were
                                            a poisonous snake which had locked upon its target and would not give up
                                            until its prey had been bitten to death.</p>
