                                            Nucleus, perhaps it shouldn’t be called that anymore, but a Saint Core
                                            Nucleus. No one has ever gone down this path before, and we still have to
                                            explore it bit by bit ourselves, so it isn’t going to be as easy or smooth
                                            sailing all the time. However, once we actually succeed, just like Xue’er
                                            said, forming that Saint Core Nucleus, we will finally truly be part of the
                                            top echelon powerhouses in the world.”</p>
                                        <p>Their learnings and gains in the month was definitely substantial, but they
                                            also knew that they had barely seen the tip of the iceberg regarding the
                                            deepest profound secrets of the Saint Attributes and the Saint Energy.
                                            However, if they wanted to do more tests, they also needed a greater amount
                                            of Saint Energy. Furthermore, the current recovery rate of the Saint Energy
                                            was just too slow, and only when Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er joined hands to
                                            form the original large whirlpool, would the recovery rate be faster. As
                                            such, they truly did need a large supply of Heavenly Energy to refine and
                                            transform into Saint Energy, as they delved deeper into the secrets.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er stood by the side, listening silently. In her heart, she was
                                            quite envious of Tian’er, but she would never excluse her from Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s side any longer. Compared to their three Sisters, perhaps Tian’er
                                            was the most compatible with Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Both of them had the top tier Tiger bloodlines, one with the Dark Demon God
                                            Tiger bloodline and the other with the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger
                                            bloodline. More importantly, their energy was perfectly complementary into
                                            forming the four Saint Attributes.</p>
                                        <p>At last, Zhou Weiqing said: “Come on, let’s go. It’s time for us to end the
                                            closed door cultivation and move out. Regarding the Saint Energy, this is a
                                            secret between us. Tian’er, Xue’er, I hope that this secret will remain ours
                                            alone. I know that you both are from your respective Great Saint Lands, and
                                            you have to consider your families as well. However, in this matter, the
                                            fact of the matter is the lesser people who know about it, the better. After
                                            all, as the saying goes, the greater the wealth a man has, the greater the
                                            greed it can spark in others… and it can only lead to our possible ruin. If
                                            anyone else knows about this power of ours, it might cause the entire world
                                            to cast greedy eyes upon us. At that time, we would be in deep trouble.”</p>
                                        <p>Towards Tian’er’s earlier suggestion, it would be a lie to say that Zhou
                                            Weiqing wasn’t tempted. Without question, it would be impossible for them to
                                            actually gain a massive amount of Saint Energy with their normal cultivation
                                            speed. Zhou Weiqing vaguely sensed that the Saint Energy was actually not
                                            something that people of their current levels would usually be able to
                                            access. Even with the four Saint Attributes fused together, it was his
                                            conjecture that perhaps only when one had consolidated their Heavenly Core
                                            Nucleus, then they would start to learn about this, slowly transforming the
                                            Heavenly Core Nucleus into the Saint Core Nucleus. However, they now had
                                            gained access to it much earlier, and were also able to start cultivating
                                            it. The key to the entire matter was actually Zhou Weiqing’s Devour
                                            Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Only with the Devour Skill would they be able to gain sufficient energy to
                                            support such an impossible cultivation target. To get so much energy, it was
                                            not realistic to Devour other Heavenly Jewel Masters, unless Zhou Weiqing
                                            wanted to go on a killing spree around the world.</p>
                                        <p>As such, Devouring Heavenly Beasts’ Heavenly Energy could possibly be the
                                            best choice. However, there were just too many things for him to do right
                                            now, and he was unable to just run off to train like that. Zhou Weiqing made
                                            a hidden resolution that once he had established everything onto the right
                                            path, he would make a trip down to the WanShou Empire together with Tian’er,
                                            entering the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens to raise their Saint Energy. Once
                                            they gained large amounts of Saint Energy, one could just imagine their
                                            power in the future. Furthermore, in terms of breaking through to the
                                            Heavenly King stage, they would not have any bottlenecks at all. Everything
                                            else aside, with the Saint Energy, their cultivation speed would be greatly
                                            increased. There were still many underlying secrets waiting to be
                                            discovered, just like a grand door to a mountain of gold had been opened,
                                            awaiting their arrival. How could he not be filled with a great fighting
                                            spirit?</p>
                                        <p>Both girls nodded instantly. Although they did not speak much else on the
                                            matter, the resolution in their eyes gave Zhou Weiqing the answer he wanted.
                                            At least, before they consolidated their Saint Core Nucleus, if anyone knew
                                            of this miraculous power, it would bring about unnecessary trouble.</p>
                                        <p>As the three of them left their cultivation room, Duan Tianlang in the next
                                            room was immediately alerted. Opening the door, Duan Tianlang came out of
                                            his room to greet them.</p>
                                        <p>“How is it, you three little fellows have finally finished your closed door
                                            cultivation?” Duan Tianlang smiled faintly as he said, a hint of teasing in
                                            his voice as well.</p>
                                        <p>Both Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er both blushed, and only Zhou Weiqing with
                                            his thick skin did not mind at all, only assuming a smug and gloating
                                            expression.</p>
                                        <p>“Senior Uncle, thank you so much for this past month. We have greatly
                                            troubled you.” Zhou Weiqing bowed respectfully towards Duan Tianlang. His
                                            respect towards Duan Tianlang was no less than his Master, the Six Ultimate
                                            Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya. This God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master
                                            definitely held a respected position deep in Zhou Weiqing’s heart.</p>
                                        <p>Duan Tianlang laughed heartily and said: “There is no need for thanks, after
                                            all, Senior Uncle is not an outsider! That damn fatty, your Master, isn’t
                                            here, and meeting such a tough circumstance, how can I not intervene? That
                                            fellow Fatty Long, if he knows some assassin dares to touch his disciple…
                                            heh heh, no matter what remote corner of the world he is hiding in, he will
                                            still dig out that assassin and destroy him.”</p>
                                        <p>“Towards the profession of assassins, I am really not too familiar. However,
                                            for one to reach the Heavenly King stage like that one, I am sure he is one
                                            of the top of that profession. Previously, there was a certain level of luck
                                            for you to be able to escape death at his hands, so during this next period
                                            of time, you all better not let your guard down. Fatty Long has been gone
                                            for quite some time, so I am sure he will be back soon. We need to keep our
                                            guards up at least until he has returned, so wherever you go in this period
                                            of time, Senior Uncle will follow you.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing also laughed heartily and said: “Then many thanks to Senior
                                            Uncle.”</p>
                                        <p>As they exited the cultivation chamber, Zhou Weiqing immediately gave the
                                            order for the Peerless Regiment officers to gather for a meeting. They had
                                            been in the Crescent City for over a month, and he had been in closed door
                                            cultivation for all this time. There were many things to handle, and he also
                                            needed first hand news before he could make further decisions.</p>
                                        <p>Before long, the Peerless Regiment officers that were currently in the
                                            Crescent City all gathered in the governer’s mansion grand hall.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo was the first to arrive. Towards the assassination attempt on Zhou
                                            Weiqing, he was the one who was most self-castigatory. He had always treated
                                            himself as Zhou Weiqing’s Follower, even though Zhou Weiqing had already
                                            lifted the Seal. He was also adept at defense, yet under such a
                                            circumstance, he had failed in his personal mission to defend and protect
                                            Zhou Weiqing. How could he not feel vexed and depressed?</p>
                                        <p>However, it was perhaps also this matter and the feeling of vexation that had
                                            incited a strong fighting spirit within him. In this month, he had finally
                                            broken through to the seven-Jeweled stage, and with the Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls that he had gained from the Heavenly Jewel Island
                                            previously, he managed to complete his seventh Consolidated Assembly Set
                                            Shield piece. His overall defense had grown to a startling degree. Lin
                                            TianAo was confident that even if that assassin came once more, he could at
                                            least help Zhou Weiqing block one attack.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing sat at the head of the table, and for the others, this was the
                                            first time in the entire month they had seen their Commander. Their eyes
                                            were filled with some surprise, as they realised that no matter Zhou
                                            Weiqing, Tian’er or Shangguan Xue’er, they seemed to be very different from
                                            a month ago.</p>
                                        <p>This was mainly in terms of their presence and aura. No one could clearly say
                                            what the change was, but the feeling was definitely different.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “I’m truly sorry everyone. During
                                            this period of time, I have been slacking off due to recovering from my
                                            injury. However, I am back now. What is our current situation like, everyone
                                            please let me know. Bro Lin, you go first.”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo was his usual stable self, nodding as he said: “Currently, things
                                            are going very well, almost the ideal path we were hoping for. The targets
                                            we have set have all been met. Currently, in the entire city, besides our
                                            Peerless Regiment warriors, we have also recruited three thousand new
                                            soldiers. Of course, these soldiers are still fresh, their combat abilities
                                            are nothing much, and they do not have much training yet, let alone any
                                            experience in fighting. They will not be much use on an actual battlefield,
                                            but at least in terms of everyday guard duties, it is still fine. At least,
                                            this greatly solves our manpower issues. After all, though the Crescent City
                                            is not considered large, it is still an entire city, and the populace is
                                            pretty high.”</p>
                                        <p>“As for the Kalise Empire, they currently do not seem to have plans to attack
                                            us yet. However, they have already started gathering troops in the Xinyue
                                            City three hundred li from here. Currently, our scouts estimate they have
                                            already gathered three Regiments of troops by now, one of which is from the
                                            Bai Da Empire. Once they start moving out, they can reach the vicinity of
                                            the Crescent City within three days to begin attacks on us.”</p>
                                        <p>“On the logistics end, the first batch of supplies from the Fei Li Empire
                                            have already reached, and is sufficient for us in the near future. More
                                            importantly, the supply lines between the Fei Li Empire have also been
                                            established and being maintained. Our main force of the Peerless Regiment
                                            has already started moving out, and are currently marching from the
                                            ZhongTian Empire to the Fei Li Empire, where they will pass through the Fei
                                            Li Empire to meet with us. The Fei Li Empire has been informed of their
                                            arrival to prevent any misunderstandings. Although it is a major movement of
                                            troops, since they are all cavalry soldiers, they should be able to arrive
                                            within a month or so. By that time, even if the Kalise Empire can amass an
                                            entire Legion of troops, we are confident in fighting them off. The Fei Li
                                            Empire will also be helping supply our main Peerless Regiment force as they
                                            move through their borders, and Vice Commanders Wei Feng and Hua Feng are in
                                            command.”</p>
                                        <p>“The main troop is moving out a lot earlier than we had planned. Although
                                            their outfitting is not fully complete, the ZhongTian Empire has already
                                            promised us that they will be aiding us in sending us our orders once they
                                            are completed. They have also given us aid in terms of supplies and gold. At
                                            the same time, the ZhongTian Empire has given you a letter, only for your
                                            eyes.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, Lin TianAo retrieved a sealed letter, passing it to Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>A letter from the ZhongTian Capital City? Towards this point, Zhou Weiqing
                                            was rather surprised. Immediately, he opened the letter to read it, right in
                                            front of everyone.</p>
                                        <p>This letter from the ZhongTian Empire was not short. First of all, it
                                            described the current situation in the south, especially the attacks and
                                            disorder of the Dan Dun Empire, pointing out clearly the possible alliance
                                            between the Bai Da Empire and Dan Dun Empire. There was also a greater
                                            description of all the Bai Da Empire armies and their formations. At the
                                            same time, the ZhongTian Empire expressed that they would be willing to
                                            increase their support for the Heavenly Bow Empire, both in terms of
                                            supplies and gold, and it would be sent to them via various unique channels.
                                            However, they had one request, for the Heavenly Bow Empire to hasten the
                                            revival of their Empire. At the same time, they were to declare war on the
                                            Kalise Empire, at a certain level to tie down the Bai Da Empire as well. The
                                            letter also expressed that if necessary, the ZhongTian Empire was willing to
                                            give some actual military support to them, though this would not happen too
                                            quickly yet.</p>
                                        <p>The promised support of gold and supplies was definitely not a small amount,
                                            and once he read the letter, the first thought in Zhou Weiqing’s mind was
                                            awe about the wealth of the ZhongTian Empire.</p>
                                        <p>The gold and supplies that the ZhongTian Empire were giving them was even
                                            more than the previous Heavenly Bow Empire’s annual taxes!</p>
