                                        <p>As the black light flashed continuously in the room, the Touch of Darkness
                                            was released. The room was not large, and as it spread out from Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s body, it reached into every corner of the entire room.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started to play around with it, making use of his mental control
                                            and spirit to make the Touch of Darkness move around and do various things.
                                            At the same time, he experimented with its stability, strength, toughness
                                            and flexibility.</p>
                                        <p>In doing so, Zhou Weiqing started to feel the difference between the Darkness
                                            Attribute and the Spatial or Wind Attributes.</p>
                                        <p>Spatial Attribute Skills required an instantaneous release of power, that was
                                            so even for the Spatial Rend. Although it could last three seconds, but the
                                            key to it succeeded was that instant of power on release.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Darkness Attribute, it was rather different. When the Touch of
                                            Darkness was released, it could be said to be just the beginning, and
                                            continued control over it was the most important.</p>
                                        <p>Just the first try of his caused Zhou Weiqing to feel some strain, as there
                                            was just too many tentacles to control. To try and control each and every
                                            one of them in doing something different not only required him to have an
                                            incredible amount of multitasking, calculating and also powerful control
                                            over the skill, Heavenly Energy and the Darkness Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>It was almost as if his entire brain had to be split into a dozen parts, and
                                            instantly Zhou Weiqing felt the true difficulty of this Skill. Although this
                                            level of control was not an additional drain on his Heavenly Energy, it was
                                            definitely a huge drain on his spirit and consciousness.</p>
                                        <p>As the first Touch of Darkness Skill ended, Zhou Weiqing did not rush into
                                            casting it again. Instead, he sat down recollecting the entire process he
                                            had gone through, the feelings and experiences he had just undergone, as
                                            well as the feedback that the skill itself returned.</p>
                                        <p>The ‘best’ part of the Touch of Darkness could be said to be the increase to
                                            all of the user’s senses, and was one of the rarest boosts available, which
                                            made it all the more valuable. With this increase in senses, it also made
                                            delving into the profound mysteries of the skill easier, allowing him to
                                            feel more, understand more and absorb more.</p>
                                        <p>Just like that, Zhou Weiqing began the process of repeatedly casting Touch of
                                            Darkness one after the other, experiencing and understanding it as time
                                            passed by.</p>
                                        <p>This time, Zhou Weiqing only spent a day before his training ended. He had
                                            not even finished half of the water, but he was forced to conclude the
                                            training - because he fainted dead away.</p>
                                        <p>The intricate control of the Touch of Darkness took an unprecedented toll on
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s spirit and consciousness. Furthermore, he had never really
                                            trained in that department before, and did not know how important it was for
                                            controlling Skills. In truth, the majority of Heavenly Jewel Masters did not
                                            go out of the way to train their spirit and consciousness; as that would
                                            usually slowly improve as their cultivation level improved.</p>
                                        <p>The unique quality about the Darkness Attribute was that it did not take a
                                            large toll on his body and physique like other skills, but a much larger
                                            toll on his spirit. By the time he had almost totally expended his spirit,
                                            his mind lapsed into a deep faint as an automatic protection reaction.</p>
                                        <p>Even Zhou Weiqing himself did not know that he had unknowingly opened up a
                                            new path for himself, a unique path of training his spirit and
                                            consciousness.</p>
                                        <p>On the surface, a Heavenly Jewel Master’s spirit was not a critical
                                            characteristic, and only those with the Divine Attribute would regard it
                                            highly. However in truth, for the Spirit Attribute to be actually one of the
                                            top three Saint Attributes, how could it be useless?</p>
                                        <p>The stronger a person’s spirit and consciousness, the greater control he
                                            would have over everything, Heavenly Energy, Skills and even the body to a
                                            certain extent. With the same amount of Heavenly Energy, the same Skill,
                                            when used by a Jewel Master with a stronger spirit, it would be a lot more
                                            efficient and powerful, perhaps even several times stronger!</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing fainted and fell into a deep sleep, Fat Cat which was not
                                            far from him suddenly opened her eyes. At that moment, there was a strange,
                                            almost astonished look in her eyes.</p>
                                        <p><i>How did he do that? </i>Fat Cat thought to herself. A few days ago, when
                                            Zhou Weiqing had first gone through the three thousand tempering training,
                                            she had already been shocked once. It could be said that the thousand
                                            tempering training was very well known by all Heavenly Jewel Masters, yet it
                                            was not widely used for a reason. No one had ever done it like Zhou Weiqing,
                                            let alone up to three thousand tempering!</p>
                                        <p>Even the members of the five Great Saint Lands would shake their heads when
                                            they talked about the thousand tempering training technique. This training
                                            method was just too harmful to one’s vitality, and possibly even life force,
                                            and if overdone, could possibly lead to serious and lasting damage. As such,
                                            although there were so many benefits to it, the drawbacks were sufficient to
                                            dissuade most from making use of such a technique.</p>
                                        <p>Most Heavenly Jewel Masters would rather waste more time in practicing their
                                            Skills over a long period of time, with much lower efficiency, than to make
                                            use of such an extreme method.</p>
                                        <p>A few days ago, when Fat Cat had witnessed Zhou Weiqing use his Spatial Rend
                                            Skill one thousand five hundred times in slightly more than a day, she had
                                            been totally shocked to the core. Even more so than Zhou Weiqing, she knew
                                            how impossible that was, and the true implications of that. Furthermore, she
                                            had been alongside Zhou Weiqing for so long, and she was extremely clear on
                                            his cultivation. Instantly, she realised that he had stumbled upon the
                                            perfect training method for himself.</p>
                                        <p>The facts had indeed been as she expected. Without even considering the huge
                                            benefits from Zhou Weiqing’s improved Spatial Rend and Silver Emperor Wing
                                            Slash having a large part to play in his winning of the various fights, just
                                            the dangerless sheer speed of his cultivation of Heavenly Energy would
                                            already breathtaking.</p>
                                        <p>Despite that, Fat Cat was once again shocked by Zhou Weiqing. With her keen
                                            senses, she could tell that Zhou Weiqing’s spirit was in an unstable flux.
                                            She was extremely familiar with such a flux; after all, her main Attribute
                                            and training focus was the Spirit Attribute. Without question, when Zhou
                                            Weiqing was tempering his Darkness attribute Touch of Darkness Skill, he was
                                            actually somehow training his spirit and consciousness at the same time!</p>
                                        <p><i>Was he some monster, or just an unbelievable genius? </i>That notion was
                                            all that Fat Cat could think of. However, even she did not realise that
                                            although she knew that the stronger Zhou Weiqing grew, the less control and
                                            power she would have over him, she did not have any killing intent, but
                                            rather a strange happiness. At that point, she somehow forgot about all the
                                            times she had been ‘bullied’ by Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>After an unknown period of time, Zhou Weiqing was slowly aroused from his
                                            deep sleep by a strange feeling.</p>
                                        <p>The first sensation he had was that of cold; his entire body feeling icy
                                            cold, and one which seemed to spread from inside. It was as if his entire
                                            body was a huge block of ice, and the cold was continuously being produced
                                            from within and spreading throughout and out from his skin.</p>
                                        <p>Such a cold was definitely not something that came from an external source.
                                            The instant that Zhou Weiqing woke, he started shivering uncontrollably,
                                            even his teeth were chattering loudly.</p>
                                        <p><i>What is happening? What is going on with me? </i>Zhou Weiqing was
                                            surprised, and as he roused fully to his senses, he realised that he had
                                            lost control of his body.</p>
                                        <p>Turning his senses inward to examine himself, Zhou Weiqing realised that he
                                            couldn’t actually sense any vestiges of Heavenly Energy. At that point, his
                                            heart sank in an icy feeling of doom, which someone left him even colder
                                            than before.</p>
                                        <p>Cultivation Deviation!</p>
                                        <p>This was the only explanation that Zhou Weiqing could think of for the state
                                            he was in, although it didn’t make sense at all. As much as he did not want
                                            to believe that he could enter cultivation deviation while training, the
                                            facts were before him, and he had no other choice but to believe it.</p>
                                        <p>He did not even have the time to to ponder on how he had actually entered
                                            cultivation deviation, when the icy cold overwhelmed his thoughts, and he
                                            lapsed into a strange mindless state.</p>
                                        <p>His entire body, down to the muscles, innards, meridians, all of it seemed
                                            frozen and mashed together, the intense pain was even worse than all the
                                            previous times he had felt when breaking through his Death Acupuncture
                                            Points; though he had previously thought that was impossible.</p>
                                        <p>With that empty feeling, it was as if the breath was being forced out of his
                                            body. The cold battering him, as if trying to turn him into a pile of ice
                                            dust.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing could almost hear his own bones groaning and creaking, the sound
                                            of his own bones made him almost break down. Alas, his mind was still
                                            strangely awake, and the pain was so intense, almost like he was struck with
                                            his own Curse of Doom’s increased pain senses while being tortured.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing had awoken, Fat Cat had also gotten up.</p>
                                        <p>Her purple eyes were wide opened as they scrutinised Zhou Weiqing, and slowly
                                            a look of delight entered them. With a shake of her body, she turned into a
                                            three metre huge form.</p>
                                        <p>She did not touch Zhou Weiqing, but the happiness in her eyes grew stronger
                                            as she stood there silently, watching the changes in his body.</p>
                                        <p>In Fat Cat’s eyes, Zhou Weiqing had totally turned a bleak grey colour.
                                            Indeed, totally grey, even down to his usually black hair, skin, eyes and
                                            even nails!</p>
                                        <p>A layer of thick Demonic Aura also extended to every section of his skin,
                                            though it was not released outwards. If Fat Cat was not looking upon him
                                            with her own eyes, she would not even be able to sense anything untoward
                                            from him.</p>
                                        <p>If it had been Lin TianAo or any of the other team members here, none of them
                                            would be able to recognize what was happening to Zhou Weiqing. Even Little
                                            Witch, who was from the Heavenly Demon Sect, one of the Great Saint Lands,
                                            would not be able to recognize it. However, Fat Cat was different. With a
                                            single look, she immediately knew what Zhou Weiqing was experiencing, as she
                                            had just gone through the exact same thing not long ago!</p>
                                        <p>Evolving! He was actually evolving!</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, Fat Cat knew that Zhou Weiqing was evolving, just like a Heavenly
                                            Beast.</p>
                                        <p>Although she could not understand how a human like Zhou Weiqing could
                                            actually go through such an evolving, she could clearly tell that this would
                                            bring a huge benefit to her as well. Just like the previous time when she
                                            evolved, Zhou Weiqing had benefited a great deal from her.</p>
                                        <p>The strange thing that left her puzzled was that although Zhou Weiqing was
                                            going through the same evolving state, he did not seem to release the same
                                            aura which would attract Heavenly Beasts to devour him.</p>
