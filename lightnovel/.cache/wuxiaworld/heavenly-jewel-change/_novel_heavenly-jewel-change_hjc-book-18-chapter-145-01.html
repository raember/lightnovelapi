                                            horizons had been broadened, and they were at a much higher stage now. At
                                            the same time, the 'smell of gunpowder' was strong in the general atmosphere
                                            of the Peerless Battalion, as all the soldiers competed to see who could
                                            earn more Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, Stored Skills, or even just whose
                                            Heavenly Energy could rise the fastest.</p>
                                        <p>In the original Ruffian Battalion, before Zhou Weiqing had taken control,
                                            even for those original Physical Jewel Masters, it was extremely rare they
                                            had Consolidated Equipment. As a result, it was an easy task to homogenize
                                            all their current Consolidated Equipment. Zhou Weiqing’s specifications for
                                            their Consolidating was a set process. First, a Consolidated Equipment Bow,
                                            next would be the two sets of Consolidated Equipment Wings. Of course, this
                                            was just the beginning, and as their power increased, there would be more in
                                            the future.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing returned to his command tent, Wei Feng and Hua Feng both
                                            arrived at the same time to see him.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander Sir, Reporting… The situation is quite dire…” Wei Feng’s
                                            expression was rather ugly, but Hua Feng remained his usual calm, unflurried
                                            self, as if nothing could cause emotional turbulence to him. Although he
                                            came in together with Wei Feng, they seemed to have different
                                            objectives.</p>
                                        <p>“Hmm, what is it?” Zhou Weiqing sat down hard on his chair with a smile on
                                            his face. He was currently in a good mood, as the news he had gotten
                                            previously was that there were three other Ruffian Battalions in the entire
                                            northern armies, with each around a thousand man strong or more. If he could
                                            gain all these men and incorporate them into his Peerless Battalion, they
                                            would number about five thousand strong, and he was expectant for that to
                                            happen.</p>
                                        <p>Five thousand men was also the ideal number in Zhou Weiqing’s heart. After
                                            all, if they numbered too many, he was also unable to upkeep them all.
                                            Furthermore, once their numbers grew too huge, they would also lose the
                                            speed and mobility that would make them more effective. What he needed was
                                            five thousand of the strongest, most elite forces, not a huge army. It
                                            looked like soon his goal, in terms of numbers at least, would be met, so
                                            how could he not be excited and happy? It meant that he was yet another step
                                            closer towards returning home and reviving his homeland.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng said solemnly: “According to our brothers deeper in the border, they
                                            have reported back that after the Swift Wolf Regiment had lost three of
                                            their Companies, there was much activity within the camp. Although they have
                                            not moved out yet, from observation it seems that they are preparing to
                                            leave at any moment. At the same time, the skies have recently been filled
                                            with the eagle tribe scouts, and we have shot down a few, but some have also
                                            escaped. We expect that they have already discovered our position. Battalion
                                            Commander, if the Swift Wolf Regiment actually comes enmasse to attack us,
                                            it will be extremely unfavourable for us! We need to make preparations for
                                            the worst case scenario, especially if their entire Regiment attacks us,
                                            what are we to do? Battalion Commander, you need to make a decision as soon
                                            as possible...”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, the smile of Zhou Weiqing’s face disappeared. “Big Bro
                                            Wei, what is your idea regarding the situation then?”</p>
                                        <p>After so much time together, they had all become familiar with each other,
                                            and much closer. Zhou Weiqing no longer called him formally by his rank as
                                            he previously did.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng said without hesitation: “We should pack up everything immediately
                                            and retreat into the tunnels. Although the eagle tribe scouts have
                                            discovered us, they are probably not able to ascertain our exact location.
                                            As long as we disappear into our hidden tunnels, even if the WanShou Empire
                                            attacks in numbers, they will not be able to do anything with us. After all,
                                            they can’t possibly have a large number of forces stay in our borders
                                            forever.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing turned his gaze towards Hua Feng and he asked: “Teacher, what
                                            about your idea?”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng smiled faintly. He was originally extremely suave and handsome, and
                                            though he was older now, he still had the distinct flavour of a mature man.
                                            His cultured and refined look was also one of the reasons why Shui Cao had
                                            started chasing him all those years ago, and all the way up until now.</p>
                                        <p>“Kill them, it’s just a Regiment.” Hua Feng said easily.</p>
                                        <p>Surprise filled Wei Feng’s face and he said: “Instructor Hua Feng, are you
                                            joking with me? That is no ordinary Regiment, it is a Regiment of ten
                                            thousand wolf cavalry soldiers, the notorious Swift Wolf Regiment! Don’t you
                                            know the victories they have carved through the battlefield over the years
                                            at our expense? Not only are they one of the main Regiments of the WanShou
                                            Empire, they have previously carved a path through our Seventh and Eighth
                                            Legions’ formations. Countless of our brethren have died at their hands…
                                            Such a force of experienced and battle hardened warriors is definitely able
                                            to take on an entire Legion of our army. Yet, our Peerless Battalion only
                                            numbers over a thousand brothers. How could we possibly fight with them?
                                            Isn’t that a suicide mission?”</p>
                                        <p>The smile on Hua Feng’s face did not waver. “If they were truly a Legion of a
                                            hundred thousand men, I would have the same opinion as you. However,
                                            although these wolf cavalry soldiers are strong, they only number ten
                                            thousand. Do you know what ten thousand means? That means, if we are
                                            accurate enough, each of us only need seven arrows, and we can wipe them all
                                            out. This half a year of intense training and hard work is definitely not
                                            for nothing…”</p>
                                        <p>Without hesitation, Wei Feng retorted: “Battalion Commander once proclaimed
                                            that as long as our power is not several times that of our enemies, we
                                            should not easily take action…” The Peerless Battalion was on the ascent,
                                            and he could see the improvement day after day, and he did not want to
                                            easily take the risk of seeing it ruined just like that.</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng said passively: “In my eyes, our power is already several times that
                                            of our enemies. In the end, the real battlefield is the best place, perhaps
                                            the only place, that we can test the fruits of our training. If we only
                                            chose the weakest opponents no matter our strength, when can our troops
                                            truly grow up? Weiqing, you decide...”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing paused for a moment before laughing, saying: “I accept both your
                                            suggestions. My decision is as follows - first, move all our camp and
                                            supplies down into the tunnels, and we will all move out to strike out at
                                            our enemy instead. We will choose the battlefield instead of waiting for
                                            them to come to us, and if we aren’t able to win, isn’t it easy for us to
                                            run? Once we enter the tunnels, so what if they chase after us? Are they
                                            going to mount their war wolves and charge into the tunnels?”</p>
                                        <p>“Ah?” Wei Feng had not expected that Zhou Weiqing would actually give such an
                                            answer. “But, Battalion Commander, if that is the case, we might end up
                                            revealing our tunnels. What would we do when the main WanShou Army actually
                                            attacks…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “I have already thought through that. In truth, this place
                                            is so desolate and cut off, without any natural resources or methods of
                                            reprovisioning without going out of the way. It is not a place for us to
                                            stay and develop on a long term basis. This is also why I gave the order to
                                            stop digging tunnels and expanding our underground base three months ago. As
                                            long as the Swift Wolf Regiment dares come and we manage to destroy them, we
                                            will leave right after that. The Seventh Legion has already asked us to
                                            leave for quite some time, and we will join them to get past this year’s
                                            WanShou Empire’s invasion. With the screen of the Seventh Legion, it will be
                                            much easier for us to train and gain experience as well.”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Wei Feng, Zhou Weiqing stood up and walked up to him, clapping him
                                            on the shoulders as he said: “Big Bro Wei, I know you think we have already
                                            built something up here, and have some sentiments for the place, especially
                                            after having stayed here for so long. I know it will not be easy for you to
                                            leave this place, but in the end, this is not the place for us to stay for
                                            long. For the future of our Peerless Battalion, we will have to leave sooner
                                            or later…”</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng nodded his head and said: “I understand. It is rather surprising to
                                            me as well… after over ten years here, I have always hated this barren and
                                            desolate northern borderlands. Yet, when it really comes down to leaving,
                                            only then do I feel unwilling to do so. However, you are right, Battalion
                                            Commander, I will listen to you. I will go make preparations…”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng grabbed hold of him and said: “Wait, don’t rush off like that! We
                                            will still need to discuss our tactics. Ten thousand Wolf Cavalry Soldiers
                                            is the best grindstone for our current Peerless Battalion, and also the best
                                            chance for us to test our combat Skills. We have to prepare in the best
                                            possible way to ensure the success.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Big Bro Wei, send for all the officers in our Peerless
                                            Battalion of the Company Leader rank and above. Let us have a discussion
                                            about tactics as well as allocation of tasks. If the Swift Wolf Regiment
                                            does not come, that is fine, but if they do come, we must give them a good
                                            head on fight, dealing them a painful blow. Tell all our brothers, if the
                                            Swift Wolf Regiment dares come, we will let them taste our Peerless
                                            Battalion’s six months of training, to show the fruits of our brothers’
                                            labour. Issue ten gold coins to all our brothers, and inform them that after
                                            the upcoming battle, there will be another round of reward according to
                                            their battle merits. Those who have performed the best will be directly
                                            awarded with Consolidating Equipment or Skill Storing. This extra gold will
                                            be the pay for participating in this battle.”</p>
                                        <p>This time, if the Swift Wolf Regiment actually attacked, it will undoubtedly
                                            be the biggest test to the Peerless Battalion thus far. Although Zhou
                                            Weiqing had arranged a backup plan, it was undoubtedly a good chance to test
                                            how successful the last few months of training had been for his untested
                                            troops. At the same time, it would also be a good test about Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            training theory and method, whether or not it had succeeded. It was a good
                                            time for the test too, if it were successful, it would definitely greatly
                                            improve the morale and cohesiveness of the entire Peerless Battalion, and if
                                            it failed, with their backup plans they should not be in too much danger,
                                            and it would not be too late for them to switch up their training
                                            methods.</p>
                                        <p>Wei Feng rushed off, and for the entirety of the next day, Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            large tent was filled with a sense of excitement and nervousness. Let alone
                                            Zhou Weiqing himself, even Wei Feng and the old hands of the Heavenly Bow
                                            Unit were excited about this upcoming major fight. All of them had seen with
                                            their own eyes how much the men of the Peerless Battalion had grown over the
                                            past few months, but no one could tell for sure what standards they had
                                            reached, especially in actual combat.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Two days later. Norther Border Plains.</p>
                                        <p>“Reporting, Sir. The Swift Wolf Regiment has appeared in our borders without
                                            warning, heading straight for us at top speed...”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was standing at the bottom of their hill camp, though by now it
                                            had been totally dismantled, with all supplies moved down into the
                                            underground tunnels, and even the soldiers were resting underground in order
                                            to react instantly.</p>
                                        <p>“Very good. Continue scouting…” Zhou Weiqing gave the command, and the scout
                                            ran off speedily. One could not underestimate these scouts, as they were the
                                            first few to be given the Consolidated Equipment Wings, and their
                                            cultivation level were all Six Physical Jewels or higher. Although they only
                                            numbered three in total, they were all powerful warriors and scouts who
                                            could hold their own, well trained in stealth and scouting. In this wide
                                            plains of the northern borders, if one could not get first hand news at the
                                            fastest time, danger and death could fall upon them at any time.</p>
                                        <p>“Alright, they are really coming. Issue my order, get everyone to prepare.”
                                            Zhou Weiqing shouted out.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion reacted extremely quickly, and within minutes, all the
                                            soldiers were dressed and geared up, standing in formation neatly before
                                            Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion numbered one thousand and five hundred currently, but
                                            they were still split into ten Companies rather than reassigning them all.
                                            Each Company had one Company Leader, a Vice Company Leader, and ten Squad
                                            Leaders. Currently, they were all neatly in ten groups in front of Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Of all ten, the First and Second Companies looked the most ferocious and
                                            valiant. Ever since Zhou Weiqing had taken over the Peerless Battalion,
                                            these two Companies had been the first to get their selection of warriors,
                                            all of them the top Physical Jewel Masters. To be able to enter these two
                                            Companies, one had to display extremely powerful personal combat skills,
                                            defeating many contenders to gain the spot. Of course, their treatment was
                                            also the best.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Shangguan Fei’er stood in front of these two Companies. Besides
                                            their own two Company Leaders, these two Companies would directly report to
                                            her.</p>
                                        <p></p>
