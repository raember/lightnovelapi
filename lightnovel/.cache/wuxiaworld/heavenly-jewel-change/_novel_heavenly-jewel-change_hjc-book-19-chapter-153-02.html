                                            weaker by the day, and who knew when it would totally collapse. However…
                                            what about Bing’er!</p>
                                        <p>Just as she opened her tent flap and stepped in, she stopped abruptly as an
                                            abrupt sense of alarm tore her from her thoughts, and her unfocused gaze
                                            instantly gathered swiftly and she snapped out: “Who’s there?”</p>
                                        <p>She did not unleash her Consolidated Equipment yet, but her Heavenly Energy
                                            immediately circulated to the maximum. At the same time, she made use of her
                                            step into the tent to enter a defensive stance that was ready to spring into
                                            action at anytime.</p>
                                        <p>“Come in.” A cold voice, with a hint of anger, rang out softly in Shangguan
                                            Fei’er’s ears.</p>
                                        <p>It was a very familiar voice, one that she had heard for all her life, and a
                                            voice that filled her heart with shock. If we were to say who Shangguan
                                            Fei’er was currently the most afraid of seeing now, it was undoubtedly
                                            Shangguan Bing’er, and the next after that would be the owner of this
                                            voice.</p>
                                        <p>Quickly stepping fully into the tent, Shangguan Fei’er instantly saw a figure
                                            who looked exactly like her, dressed in the ZhongTian army uniform. It was
                                            Shangguan Xue’er, standing right in the middle of the tent, the exact same
                                            features with the only difference was that frosty look on her face, and even
                                            her clear eyes held a hint of cold and anger as she looked towards Shangguan
                                            Fei’er.</p>
                                        <p>“Big Sister, you, why are you here?” Even Shangguan Fei’er could sense the
                                            noticeable tremor in her voice as she asked the question.</p>
                                        <p>“Why am I here? What do you think? If I did not come any sooner, I’m afraid
                                            you would do something to let down Bing’er right?” Shangguan Xue’er’s voice
                                            was filled with anger. This was actually the first time that Shangguan
                                            Fei’er had seen her like this.</p>
                                        <p>Both these sisters were triplets after all, and though Shangguan Bing’er had
                                            not grown up together with them, the two of them had, and they were
                                            extremely close to each other. Although their ages were less than an hour
                                            apart, Shangguan Xue’er had always shown the bearing of an elder sister
                                            since a young age. No matter what, she would always give way Shangguan
                                            Fei’er in all things. However, when it came to critical moments, if
                                            Shangguan Xue’er got angry, Shangguan Fei’er would definitely listen to her
                                            obediently. It could be said that in the entire Heaven’s Expanse Palace,
                                            even the two brothers Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue were unable
                                            to control the Little Demon Girl, and only her elder sister could make her
                                            afraid. However, she was not afraid of Shangguan Xue’er’s power, but that
                                            Shangguan Xue’er would ignore her, and lapse into a cold war.</p>
                                        <p>Even in the past when they were growing up together in the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace, no matter the argument or their worst deadlocks, they had only
                                            entered a cold war. This was actually the first time that Shangguan Xue’er
                                            had scolded her like that directly.</p>
                                        <p>“Sis, what are you talking about!” Although Shangguan Fei’er refused to admit
                                            anything, her heart started racing.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er gave a cold humph and said: “What am I talking about? I
                                            already witnessed it with my own eyes last night, do I still need to say
                                            anything else?”</p>
                                        <p>“Last night… it was you?” Shangguan Fei’er instantly felt as if she had been
                                            doused with a bucket of ice cold water. The next moment, her face turned
                                            totally red.</p>
                                        <p>However, to her surprise, Shangguan Xue’er’s face also turned red.</p>
                                        <p>What Shangguan Fei’er did not know was that as triplets, under such a close
                                            proximity like last night, they had somehow sparked an induction of
                                            emotions, causing Shangguan Xue’er to clearly sense what Shangguan Fei’er
                                            had been feeling, that sense of joy while she was being intimate with Zhou
                                            Weiqing, as well as that feeling of excitement. It was also because of that
                                            feeling she had never sensed before that she had quickly fled that scene so
                                            hurriedly instead of showing herself then. At this moment, seeing her sister
                                            in front of her, she suddenly remembered what she had seen and felt last
                                            night, not to mention that day on the Heavenly Jewel Island which she would
                                            never forget, the kiss that caused her to grit her teeth in anger. That was
                                            her first kiss!</p>
                                        <p>“Sis, I’m wrong…” Shangguan Fei’er lowered her head in shame. If the Peerless
                                            Battalion’s ruffians soldiers saw such a sight, their jaws would drop all
                                            the way onto the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Was this still their valiant, ferocious drill instructor who would smack down
                                            anyone who caused trouble?!</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s expression eased slightly. After all, her relationship
                                            with Shangguan Fei’er was extremely close. In the past, every time Shangguan
                                            Fei’er did something wrong and was caught by her, she would admit her
                                            mistake just like that, and every time, Shangguan Xue’er would forgive her.
                                            They had not spoken heart to heart for quite some time, and with those
                                            familiar words, Shangguan Xue’er felt her heart melting. However… this time…
                                            was what she did so easily forgiven?</p>
                                        <p>“Fei’er, don’t you know you are playing with fire? He is Bing’er’s man! They
                                            are already engaged to be married, yet… yet… that actually happened. How,
                                            how could you be intimate with him? Is that fair to Bing’er?” Shangguan
                                            Xue’er paused for a while, biting her lip, but she finally gritted her teeth
                                            and steeled herself to continue.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing her words, the rosy red cheeks of Shangguan FEi’er suddenly turned
                                            ashen pale. She bit her lip lightly and said: “I’m sorry, Sis, I really am…
                                            I know I am wrong, but … but… I really could not control myself. I also do
                                            not know when it was that I actually fell for him. Sis, feelings and
                                            emotions… it is not something that can be controlled. When I first ran to
                                            look for him, I was just curious about him, and more so, to take some
                                            revenge against him for both myself and your sake. Who asked him to steal
                                            our first kisses! However, that bad fellow seems to have some strange magic
                                            about him. The longer I spent with him, the more I was influenced by that…
                                            unable to extricate myself. I…”</p>
                                        <p>As she spoke up to that point, her beautiful eyes were misty and welling up,
                                            her body shuddering slightly as she clenched her hands tightly.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at her like that, Shangguan Xue’er could not bear to continue.
                                            Although she was always icy on the surface, it was just a cover for her soft
                                            heart. In truth, amongst the three Shangguan Sisters, she was the most
                                            tenderhearted. However, she had always used her icy cold demeanor to cover
                                            that tender-heartedness. Seeing her little sister in such pain and
                                            suffering, her own heart ached in tandem.</p>
                                        <p>Taking a few steps forward, she embraced her sister, who fell into her arms
                                            and started crying.</p>
                                        <p>In the past few months, her relationship with Zhou Weiqing had been the
                                            greatest problem plaguing Shangguan Fei’er. She had put her all into
                                            training the Peerless Battalion soldiers, not just because she enjoyed it,
                                            but also also in an attempt to lose herself in it and prevent herself from
                                            thinking too much about things. She had also started trying to avoid Zhou
                                            Weiqing, but even though she did not see him, it was as if he held some
                                            magnetic power, and she could not escape it.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, seeing her own big sister, the emotions she was hiding in her
                                            heart burst forth, and in opening the floodgates of her tears, she found she
                                            was unable to stop. In moments, Shangguan Xue’er’s shoulder clothes was
                                            soaked with her tears.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing her sister crying in such sorrow, Shangguan Xue’er could no longer
                                            speak the words of admonition on her lips. Stroking her back softly, she
                                            gritted her teeth and said: “That bastard Zhou Weiqing, playing around with
                                            one of my sisters isn’t enough for him, and he has to incur another one. I
                                            really feel like killing him with one sword strike.”</p>
                                        <p>“No… please…” Hearing that, Shangguan Fei’er’s crying suddenly stopped and
                                            she grasped hold of Shangguan Xue’er urgently, looking up in fright.</p>
                                        <p>“You…” Looking at her like that, Shangguan Xue’er was left speechless.
                                            “Fei’er, you have really fallen for him beyond help.”</p>
                                        <p>Her brow furrowed tight, Shangguan Xue’er was currently in an inward dilemma.
                                            She did not know how to face both her sisters. Originally, the words she had
                                            prepared to speak out, she found she was unable to say them. Her heart ached
                                            for Bing’er, and did not wish for her husband to be taken away, but
                                            Shangguan Fei’er was also her sister! How could she hurt one sister for
                                            another? That was something she could not possibly do, not at all. In truth,
                                            Shangguan Xue’er had never been an ambitious person. In her eyes, even the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace Palace Master position was no match for kinship and
                                            familial love. Even the reason why she worked and trained so hard was to
                                            make her uncle and father happy, to maintain their family and protect them
                                            from being hurt by any enemies.</p>
                                        <p>“Sis, what should I do? I truly am unable to let it go. There have been many
                                            times in the past few months that I have tried to garner my courage to leave
                                            him, but every time I tried to step out of the camp, that sense of loss… it
                                            is as if I am being torn apart from the inside, and I could not help myself
                                            and walked back in. I really like him, and also like this Ruffian Battalion
                                            we have here. Everyone here, although each and everyone of them has their
                                            flaws, but they are extremely genuine… so real. No matter what they think,
                                            they will show it out instantly, even if they might seem rough, even vulgar
                                            and coarse, but as compared to our Heaven’s Expanse Palace, they just feel
                                            more authentic to me. I truly do not wish to leave.”</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Shangguan Fei’er’s pitiful look, Shangguan Xue’er could only
                                            remain silent. Even if she asked her what to do, she too did not know!</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said softly: “Did Father ask you to come and bring me
                                            back?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er shook her head and said: “Father only asked me to come and
                                            keep watch on that Zhou Weiqing; he did not ask me to bring you back.”</p>
                                        <p>“Really?” Upon hearing those words, it was as if Shangguan Fei’er had been
                                            injected with stimulants. She leapt up abruptly, exclaiming: “Great, that’s
                                            awesome! Sis, you are the best!” As she said that, she planted a big kiss on
                                            Shangguan Xue’er’s cheek.</p>
                                        <p>Caught by surprise by the sudden kiss, Shangguan Xue’er flushed slightly and
                                            said: “Stop it. Although Father did not ask me to bring you back, but I am
                                            also here to keep watch on you as well. I have already been here for some
                                            time… previously everything was still okay, and you were still able to keep
                                            your distance from him. However, what happened yesterday? Fei’er, you know,
                                            Bing’er has been separated from us for so long, since birth, and it is
                                            Father who has let her and Mother down. Now that she has finally returned to
                                            us, if you really steal her beloved, how are we going to face her in
                                            future?! She is so kind and goodhearted…”</p>
                                        <p>The excitement that had just risen up disappeared once more, and Shangguan
                                            Fei’er sighed softly. “I also do not know, Sis, I truly do not know how to
                                            face Bing’er. It isn’t like I haven’t thought about it… if not for Bing’er,
                                            I would have already accepted Little Fatty long ago…”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er couldn’t help but ask: “Is that fellow really that good? Is
                                            he really worth you being like this?”</p>
                                        <p>To her surprise, Shangguan Fei’er nodded without hesitation, saying: “It is
                                            true, Sis. Although Little Fatty might seem bad at times, rougish and a
                                            scoundrel… But, the things he shows subconsciously has truly infected me. If
                                            I have not truly fallen in love, I would not be suffering so much now. What
                                            should I do!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er took a deep breath and sighed deeply, saying: “Fei’er, such
                                            a thing can only depend on yourself.”</p>
                                        <p>“I… I…” Tears welled up once again in Shangguan Fei’er’s eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er thought deeply for a moment and said: “Fei’er, you go back
                                            home then. You have to.”</p>
                                        <p>“No, I.. I do not want to leave.” Shangguan Fei’er replied almost as a
                                            reflex. Looking at the strange look in her sister’s eyes, she lowered her
                                            head and said: “Sis, I’m afraid that if I leave, I will never see Little
                                            Fatty again. Furthermore, there are still so many things for me to do here
                                            at the Peerless Battalion. I really cannot leave!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er pulled at her once more. “Silly girl, you cannot just leave
                                            things like this forever, or keep avoiding the topic. You will have to solve
                                            the issue eventually. You definitely have to return to the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace. If you think you truly love that bastard, then the only way is to
                                            speak to Bing’er and get her forgiveness! Although I do not want to see such
                                            a thing happen and give that fellow such an advantage, but… who asked you
                                            both to…”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing those words, Shangguan Fei’er was struck dumb, opening her mouth and
                                            staring at Shangguan Xue’er in amazement.</p>
                                        <p>Being stared at like that for so long, Shangguan Xue’er felt rather
                                            embarrassed, and she retorted: “What are you staring at me like that
                                            for?”</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, Shangguan Fei’er took a big step forward and gave her a big
                                            hug, giving her another kiss on the cheek. “Sis, you are just too smart! Why
                                            didn’t I think of that? That’s right, isn’t that the perfect solution? Both
                                            Bing’er and myself can marry Little Fatty! Hehehe, that’s too good!”</p>
                                        <p>“Good? Good your head!” Shangguan Xue’er gave her a light thwap on the head
                                            with her hand. “You are really hopeless. What so good about that fellow you
                                            are so eager? You silly girl! Furthermore, whether or not you can persuade
                                            Bing’er remains to be seen.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er smiled happily and said: “I’m sure there is a way. Bing’er
                                            is so kind and gentle, I’m sure she will forgive me. She can be the first
                                            wife, and I’ll be the second, anyway we are sisters. That Zhou Little Fatty
                                            is such a player, there is still that Tian’er, better to let our own gain
                                            the advantage than outsiders! With me and Bing’er together, we can unite
                                            together against the others, and we won’t lose out.”</p>
                                        <p>It was Shangguan Xue’er’s turn to be struck dumb. She truly could not
                                            understand what her sister was thinking, and no matter what, she could only
                                            think how terrible this Zhou Weiqing was. Yet, in her sisters’ eyes, that
                                            fellow was like some treasure, and she truly could not understand it.</p>
                                        <p>“You… You are really making me angry!” Shangguan Xue’er pushed her away
                                            lightly in exasperation. “Hmph, you decide for yourself then, I shall not
                                            interfere in this matter anymore.” As she said that, Shangguan Xue’er turned
                                            around. Currently, she did not have any sign of her usual icy outlook.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said merrily: “You can’t not interfere, who asked you to be
                                            my sister! You can’t cut off blood ties like that.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er gave another exasperated hmph. Looking at her back,
                                            Shangguan Fei’er abruptly thought of a daring idea. Although she felt guilty
                                            towards Shangguan Bing’er, she had after all grown up with Shangguan Xue’er,
                                            and if she were to say who she was closer to, it would definitely be
                                            Shangguan Xue’er. When that daring idea popped up in her head, her heart
                                            raced instantly, and her eyes swirled about in her sockets as the idea took
                                            hold in her mind.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing her sister’s words cut off so abruptly, Shangguan Xue’er turned back
                                            in curiosity, only to see her with her head lowered, as if deep in thought.
                                            She did not suspect anything, asking: “Fei’er, when are you prepared to
                                            return?”</p>
                                        <p>“Ah?” Shangguan Fei’er was broken out of her reverie, and quickly said: “Sis,
                                            I cannot return at such short notice, at least until things here are
                                            relatively stable. Anyway, Bing’er is still in closed door cultivation, you
                                            wouldn’t want me to disturb her training now right?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er insisted: “At least you need to set a time. I will not
                                            interfere between you and Zhou Weiqing, but before you get Bing’er’s
                                            permission, I will not allow you to be intimate with him.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said: “We are just about to receive a new batch of soldiers.
                                            In two months, the WanShou Empire armies are going to attack. Weiqing said
                                            that this is the best opportunity for us to temper our Peerless Battalion,
                                            to put them through the grinder of true combat. In such a critical moment,
                                            how could I leave him? Leave them? How about this, I will return as soon as
                                            the WanShou Empire armies are beaten back.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er thought about it for a moment, and decided her words made
                                            sense. Nodding slowly, she said: “Alright then, but you must honour your
                                            words.” Towards this Little Demon Girl, she was all too familiar with her
                                            character.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said seriously: “Sis, I will listen to you. As soon as the
                                            WanShou Empire armies are beaten back, I will definitely go back. At the
                                            same time, I also promise you that during this time, I will definitely not…
                                            you know… with Little Fatty. However, I also have something to ask you, how
                                            about that?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er got her promise and relaxed inwardly. Subconsciously, she
                                            replied: “What is it?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said: “Sis, you have also seen for yourself, this Little
                                            Fatty has such a ‘flowery’ heart, and our ZhongTian Empire armies also allow
                                            females to join. For example, that Shen Yi from the Sixteenth Regiment
                                            beside us used to have good feelings towards Little Fatty, and even wanted
                                            to marry him. That’s why, if I really leave, I cannot help but be worried.
                                            Furthermore, if I go, these Peerless Battalion brothers will not have anyone
                                            to take care of them. Your power is greater than mine, if I leave, it will
                                            be stealthily, then you can replace my chief instructor position and not let
                                            Little Fatty discover it. Firstly, to help me take care of the soldiers
                                            here, and secondly to keep watch on him for me and Bing’er. Don’t let me
                                            have any other women, otherwise you can beat him up!”</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing her words, Shangguan Xue’er did not feel anything amiss. After
                                            all, what Shangguan Fei’er said was true, that Zhou Weiqing was just too
                                            much of a player, if no one kept him in check, who knew how many other women
                                            he would attract. Her own two sisters had already fallen for this fellow,
                                            and Shangguan Xue’er naturally did not want anyone else to come into the
                                            picture.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er had truly spent too much time with Zhou Weiqing and had been
                                            influenced by him, even her words in the art of trickery was at a much
                                            higher level. She first sincerely agreed with all her sister’s requests,
                                            before giving a small request of her own… with all of it for Bing’er and her
                                            own sake. Naturally, Shangguan Xue’er would not be suspicious.</p>
                                        <p>“Alright then, I will help you keep watch on him. If he dares to court any
                                            other girls, then my sword will…” As she said that, Shangguan Xue’er made a
                                            downward chopping motion.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er was laughing inwardly. She had not expected that her sister
                                            would rise to the bait so easily. Her daring idea was on the first step to
                                            coming true.</p>
                                        <p>Inside, she thought to herself: <i>Little Fatty, it is all up to you to
                                            succeed. If you can drag Sis down as well, Heh Heh… then us three Sisters
                                            can stay together forever, and we three can bully you! Hmph hmph, we’ll see
                                            if you dare bully me next time.</i></p>
                                        <p>If Shangguan Xue’er knew what Shangguan Fei’er was thinking at that moment,
                                            she would definitely run over and slay him with a single sword strike. Alas
                                            for her, she did not know that she had fallen into her sister’s trap.</p>
                                        <p>“Sis, then will you still hide in the camp?” Shangguan Fei’er asked.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er shook her head and said: “How can I stay here, I have been
                                            observing you all from nearby the camp. I brought enough food.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said happily: “Don’t… stay here! You can stay in my tent…
                                            anyway besides that fellow, no one else would dare intrude here. He is in
                                            closed door cultivation in the near future, and will not come here as well.
                                            We have not seen each other for so long, I want to keep company with
                                            you!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er could only nod helplessly and say: “Alright alright, you
                                            silly girl! What can I say to that. However, if I stay here, you’ll have to
                                            tell me everything that has happened between you and that Zhou Little Fatty.
                                            Let me see what he has done to make you fall for him so hard. Don’t you know
                                            that what you said just now, I truly cannot believe that you are my sister,
                                            the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er laughed and said: “No problem, I’ll tell you everything,
                                            even all the details of our intimacy, how about that?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s face turned cold. “Fei’er, your skin is getting itchy
                                            right?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er giggled and said: “Too bad there isn’t enough space,
                                            otherwise I do want to have a practice fight. Although I did not have much
                                            practice time by myself since I came here, however perhaps because I have
                                            been enjoying myself while teaching these fellows, I also have learned a
                                            lot. I have the feeling that I am almost about to breakthrough to the
                                            Seventh Jewel, almost catching up with you!”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er smiled faintly and said: “You better work hard then. I’m
                                            afraid that you currently can’t fight with me still.”</p>
                                        <p>As she said that, Shangguan Xue’er closed her eyes. Instantly, a gentle aura
                                            rose from her body, filling the entire tent with a strange sensation, as if
                                            the entire air had been turned into liquid, reverberating. The soft, gentle
                                            sensation seemed to envelop Shangguan Fei’er. There was no strong Heavenly
                                            Energy fluctuations, but Shangguan Fei’er could feel as if she was in a
                                            swamp, restricted in an uncomfortable feeling.</p>
                                        <p>“You… you already grasped the Boundless Infinitum Technique?” Shangguan
                                            Fei’er said in shock.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded slightly, saying: “My Heavenly Energy cultivation
                                            level has almost caught up with Big Bro Zhan.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er gave a speechless look before saying: “You are truly born to
                                            cultivate… I don’t think my talent is any lesser, but how come I can never
                                            catch up to you? Nevermind, although I can’t catch up to you, but my man
                                            will definitely do so.”</p>
                                        <p>“What do you mean your man?! So unpleasant sounding, next time don’t speak
                                            about such things like that.” Shangguan Xue’er furrowed her brow once
                                            more.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said happily: “Why not, even you have agreed, so he is now
                                            my man.”</p>
