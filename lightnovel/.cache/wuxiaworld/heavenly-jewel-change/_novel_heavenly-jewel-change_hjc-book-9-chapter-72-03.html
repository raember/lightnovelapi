                                            from such a height onto the stage, how could it not cause a powerful
                                            commotion. Others usually jumped up swiftly and quietly, yet she decided to
                                            do the reverse. Of course, there was no doubt that it had a stunning effect.
                                            In that instant, she drew the attention of everyone, including the four
                                            seeded teams and the VIP guests.</p>
                                        <p>The Fei Li Battle Team uniforms were dark green, also with gold thread
                                            embroidery. The difference from the ZhongTian's uniform was that the
                                            embroidery was mostly on the left part of the chest, forming the symbol of
                                            the Fei Li Empire, the Cross Sword.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, even the judge on the stage was startled by Crow’s jump, and
                                            looking at the slight crack in the Diamond / Titanium floor, his mouth
                                            twitched a little.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, the Mi’Ou Battle Team Member also ascended the stage.</p>
                                        <p>He was a tall, well built youth. Originally, he had moved out at the same
                                            time as Crow, but when Crow landed on the Crow, he had been startled and
                                            lost his balance. Looking at this girl in front of him who was even larger
                                            and more muscled, this youthful member from the Mi’Ou Empire couldn’t help
                                            but have a strange expression on his face, as a sense of wariness and danger
                                            crept up on him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued sitting relaxedly in the Rest House, his expression
                                            content and pleased, looking every bit like a genius strategist who had
                                            planned everything, as if everything was in his grasp. There was a reason
                                            why he had used this lineup; no matter which team, everyone attached an
                                            extremely high value on the first fight. After all, a good start would also
                                            be a good omen, giving a boost to morale, and generally advantageous to the
                                            team. As such, the first member was usually one of the stronger team
                                            members. That was also the reason why Zhou Weiqing had assigned Crow to be
                                            the first; he was extremely confident in her abilities, no matter in terms
                                            of physique, strength or combat skills, she would definitely be able to stun
                                            any opponents.</p>
                                        <p>Normally, the second member to be sent out would likely be slightly weaker
                                            than the first; after all there were five fights in total. By sending Ye
                                            Paopao as the second member, Zhou Weiqing estimated that there would be at
                                            least a seventy percent chance of winning. Added on to the fact that he was
                                            extremely confident of winning the third fight with himself and Crow, even
                                            if Ye Paopao lost the second fight, he would personally take the fourth
                                            fight to seal the deal.</p>
                                        <p>On the stage, the judge said solemnly: “Both sides, introduce
                                            yourselves.”</p>
                                        <p>Crow said casually: “Fei Li Battle Team, Crow.”</p>
                                        <p>The opposing team member said solemnly: “Mi’Ou Battle Team, Wu
                                            Zhengyang.”</p>
                                        <p>The judge continued: “The rules are very simple, both of you can attack as
                                            you please, there are no restrictions on weapons. Beastmasters are not
                                            allowed to use Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills. As long as anyone
                                            admits defeat, no one is allowed to continue attacking. Understood?”</p>
                                        <p>Both sides nodded in agreement, and the judge quickly gave the start signal,
                                            and the first fight of the Fei Li Battle Team had finally began.</p>
                                        <p>The Mi’Ou Battle Team Member Wu Zhengyang shouted out loud, instantly
                                            releasing his Heavenly Jewels, and they could all clearly see four Icy Jade
                                            Physical Jewels appear around his right wrist.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at his Physical Jewels, Zhou Weiqing’s mouth twitched upwards in a
                                            happy smile. Towards Crow, the worst type of opponents were Agility Type
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters with high offensive capabilities, just like Little
                                            Four. Since this Wu Zhengyang was a Strength Type Heavenly Jewel Master, how
                                            could he possibly compete in strength with Crow? After all, he wasn’t Zhou
                                            Weiqing!</p>
                                        <p>Crow also released her Heavenly Jewels, and when the three Icy Jade Physical
                                            Jewels and three Star Ruby Elemental Jewels appeared around her wrists, loud
                                            cries of surprise rang out from amongst the audience.</p>
                                        <p>Crow was just too tall and large, and although her uniform was specially
                                            tailored for her, it could not withstand this girl’s fighting spirit, as she
                                            rolled up her sleeves as soon as she ascended the stage in a fighting
                                            stance, thus revealing her Elemental Jewels for her everyone to see.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, seeing that Fei Li Empire had been so arrogant as to only send
                                            four team members, all the teams had estimated that this Fei Li Empire had
                                            definitely come prepared. None of them had expected to see that the first
                                            member to fight would be a mere three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, no
                                            matter how valiant or strong she looked. After all, in the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master world, physique did not usually have a large impact on determining
                                            victory.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Crow’s three sets of Jewels, Wu Zhengyang started, especially since
                                            Crow’s Elemental Jewels did not seem to be unique, just ordinary Fire
                                            Attributes. He couldn’t help but exclaim: “So, you’re just here to attempt
                                            to intimate people!”</p>
                                        <p>Crow grinned and said: “Heh heh, so what if I’m intimidating?” As she said
                                            that, she took a step forward, charging towards Wu Zhengyang.</p>
                                        <p>Wu Zhengyang gave a cold humph, the four Physical Jewels around his right
                                            wrist lighting up. Although Crow only had a three-Jeweled cultivation level,
                                            he did not underestimate her. To be able to represent the Mi’Ou Battle Team,
                                            especially to be sent out first, he definitely had his own merits; no matter
                                            in terms of power levels, battle experience, or mentality, he was definitely
                                            very outstanding.</p>
                                        <p>A long, nearly 1.5 metres long and half chi wide heavy sword appeared in his
                                            hands. At the same time, a shield appeared in his other hand, along with a
                                            shoulder pauldrons and chestplate. Glimmering with a silver light along with
                                            the Icy Mist, without question, out of the four Consolidated Equipment he
                                            had summoned, at leasts three were a set.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as his Consolidated Equipment coalesced, Wu Zhengyang aura and
                                            fighting spirit rose dramatically. With a sliding step forward, he swung the
                                            heavy sword with a single arm towards Crow’s head.</p>
                                        <p>Facing Crow, who had not even released a single Consolidated Equipment, he
                                            naturally did not rush to use his Stored Skills. In the Mi’Ou Battle Team,
                                            he was the second most powerful person, with only their mainstay being able
                                            to beat him. As such, it was possible he had to fight in the 2v2 match once
                                            more, and reducing any unnecessary expenditure of Heavenly Energy was
                                            extremely important. At least, he would have probe out Crow’s actual power
                                            first.</p>
                                        <p>A four-Jeweled Strength Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, in addition to a
                                            Consolidated Heavy Sword, the power of the sword as it whistled down was
                                            rather stunning, causing a screeching sound as it flew through the air. His
                                            own strength, the additional boost of the Consolidated Equipment Set,
                                            accompanied by his flowing style of movement, Wu Zhengyang’s strike could be
                                            said to be nigh perfect. He even covered his own body with the shield in his
                                            left hand, protecting himself while he attacked; this was truly the best
                                            strategy to test out someone’s real power. It was also a position where he
                                            could unleash a continuous flurry of blows in succession, and he was
                                            extremely confident that he could finish this fight against this lower
                                            cultivation level Heavenly Jewel Master quickly.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Wu Zhengyang’s judgement and strategy was not wrong at all; alas he
                                            had still underestimated Crow, using a normal Heavenly Jewel Master’s power
                                            to judge her. Yet, was she normal at all?</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the heavy sword rushing towards her, Crow stopped abruptly. Her
                                            fighting skills and combat abilities were deeply ingrained in her, and with
                                            a quick lift of her left hand, she actually used her naked hands to grab the
                                            Heavy Sword, and even more so, doing so on the blade itself!</p>
                                        <p>No matter what, Wu Zhengyang had not expected Crow to grab his blade just
                                            like that! *Claangg* A huge sound rang out as he felt as if his Heavy Sword
                                            had embedded itself deep into a steel vise. Despite exerting all of his
                                            considerable strength and Heavenly Energy, it did not budge even a little,
                                            and Crow’s hands did not move as well. As for her, she looked on with a
                                            smile on her face as her hands were still grabbing onto the Heavy Sword,
                                            looking completely relaxed.</p>
                                        <p>Crow’s movements were always simple and straightforward. Whenever a simple
                                            action could solve the problem, she would not go for the complicated method.
                                            With her left hand still grabbing hold of her opponent’s Heavy Sword, her
                                            right leg kicked out savagely. Although there was a large Heavy Sword in
                                            between them, but Crow just lifted it up and the thick, powerful long legs
                                            of hers lashed out in a straight line, smashing into Wu Zhengyang’s
                                            shield.</p>
                                        <p>*Peng*!</p>
                                        <p>The entire audience's’ jaws dropped as Wu Zhengyang flew like a launched
                                            cannonball as he was kicked by Crow. Along with his four Consolidated
                                            Equipment, he flew all the way out of the stage, past the Resting Houses,
                                            before smashing heavily into the Plaza.</p>
                                        <p>And so, the first fight between the Fei Li Battle Team and Mi’Ou Battle Team
                                            ended; the entire ‘fight’ taking barely a few seconds.</p>
                                        <p>Shock. Absolute shock. Even the great powerhouses on the VIP stage stared
                                            with their jaws open. As the saying goes, ‘In front of Absolute Strength,
                                            Tricks are Useless’, and Crow truly showed that in front of everyone in that
                                            fight.</p>
                                        <p>When Crow had kicked Wu Zhengyang’s shield and the loud ensuing sound rang
                                            out, many hearts clenched tightly and twitched, as if their owners had been
                                            the one kicked.</p>
                                        <p>Wu Zhengyang smashed into the ground, stunned totally until he wasn’t even
                                            able to get up. His Consolidated Equipment Shield showed several slim
                                            cracks, and it was his fourth Jewel’s Consolidated Equipment! What kind of
                                            terrifying strength was required to do something like that?! After all, he
                                            was also a Strength Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>Crow stood proudly in the middle of the stage, her hands at her hips as she
                                            said airily: “That little gigolo sure didn’t have his meal! Come on, next
                                            one!”</p>
                                        <p>Only then did the judge recover his senses, and he coughed politely: “About
                                            that… Participant Crow, everyone can only fight in one 1v1 fight.”</p>
                                        <p>Crow started, then scratched her head sheepishly: “Ohh, right. I forgot about
                                            that totally. So, does that fight just now count as my win?”</p>
                                        <p>The judge could only stare at her helplessly, before nodding quickly and
                                            saying: “First fight, Fei Li Battle Team wins.”</p>
                                        <p>Crow grinned, bowing to the judge, before jumping off the stage. This time,
                                            quite a few of them closed their eyes as she landed with another loud thud.
                                            This girl definitely had a very unique character!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing remained seated in the Rest House, an amused smile dancing on
                                            his lips. Crow sure knew how to act! In that fight, she had acted so naive
                                            and simpleminded. Together with her huge physique, it was easy for others to
                                            dismiss her as a ‘musclebrain’.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, if anyone thought that way, they would be very wrong, and would be
                                            falling right into her trap. After all, previously when Zhou Weiqing had bet
                                            with Little Four, Crow and Xiao Yan had not joined in the bet. Under the
                                            guise of her honest, simpleminded exterior, she definitely was extremely
                                            intelligent. Of course, her acting skills was good enough to impress even
                                            Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Wu Zhengyang was carried back to the Resting House by his team members. When
                                            he finally gained his breath, he couldn’t help but vomit out a mouthful of
                                            blood, his expression turning green. That wasn’t because he had sustained
                                            any heavy injuries, but rather because he had been just too vexed by that
                                            loss. He had not even used much of his power, yet he had lost just like
                                            that. He hadn’t even used a single Stored Skill! What the…</p>
                                        <p>Alas, a loss was a loss; as long as he fell off the stage, that counted as a
                                            loss, and there was nothing he could do about it. By then, the Judge shouted
                                            out: “Second fight, one vs one. Get ready, both sides please send your
                                            respective team members.”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao stood up, arranging his uniform gracefully as he strolled forward.
                                            As compared to Crow, he was much more normal, as he walked up the steps to
                                            the stage.</p>
