                                            rise.”</p>
                                        <p>“Thank you Master.” Zhou Weiqing would naturally complete his entire act, and
                                            he respectfully kowtowed three times to the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor
                                            before standing up, standing honestly and industriously beside him.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was smiling happily,
                                            looking on with a pleased expression at his new disciple.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, when the Blood Red Hell members had started fighting with Zhou
                                            Weiqing and his companions, this Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had already
                                            been there. He had some connection with the Snow Deer Tribe, and had been
                                            relaxing here with a nice feast when he had sensed two of the Snow Deer
                                            Tribesmen die, and he had come to investigate. When he had seen Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s party clashing with the Blood Red Hell party, he decided to stop
                                            and watch first.</p>
                                        <p>When he saw Zhou Weiqing’s Seven Stars Accompanying the Moon Archery Skill,
                                            he couldn’t help but give a small cry of surprise; and that was because he
                                            had seen with a single glance how many Attributes Zhou Weiqing had.</p>
                                        <p>At the Heavenly Emperor Stage level, many things that ordinary people could
                                            not sense were extremely clear to his eyes. As for what exactly were the six
                                            Attributes of Zhou Weiqing’s Alexandrite Cat’s Eye, he could not see clearly
                                            at once, but he could definitely tell that there were six Attributes indeed.
                                            Furthermore, he had been able to sense several of the Attributes from Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s usage of the Seven Stars Accompanying the Moon and the imbued
                                            skills.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why he had been called the Six Ultimate was because he was just
                                            like Zhou Weiqing, with Six Elemental Attributes. He did not belong to any
                                            Great Saint Lands or any sects, and was an extremely rare, independent
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master who had fully trained on his own. Although from the
                                            surface appearance he seemed to be only forty odd years of age, he was
                                            actually over a hundred years old. As such, although he called Shangguan
                                            Tianyang a little rascal, in terms of age and generation wise, it was indeed
                                            true. After all, he had risen to fame together with the previous Palace
                                            Master of the Heaven’s Expanse Place. Out of all the independent Heavenly
                                            Jewel Masters, he was definitely the most powerful, and the toughest to deal
                                            with.</p>
                                        <p>Due to his six Attributes and love of freedom, although the Six Ultimate
                                            Heavenly Emperor was already over a hundred years old, up until now he had
                                            not found any disciples. At that moment, when he spotted Zhou Weiqing with
                                            his six Attributes, he could no longer resist. Furthermore, he had an
                                            appreciation of Zhou Weiqing’s character; even leaving the impressive Seven
                                            Stars Accompanying the Moon Archery Skill and its effects aside, just by
                                            succeeding in scaring off the Blood Red Hell members showed his will and
                                            cunning. In his eyes, such sly and cunning people were able to live the
                                            longest. As such, he had jumped out to get Zhou Weiqing to acknowledge him
                                            as master. Although he knew that his kowtowing had elements of acting, he
                                            did not care. Being able to gain such a disciple was of great importance to
                                            him as well.</p>
                                        <p>A good teacher was hard to find, but at the same time, correspondingly, a
                                            good disciple was also a tough find! Six Attributes… such a rare occurrence
                                            that the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor did not know if there was a third
                                            person in the world with the same number of attributes. As such, when such
                                            an opportunity came before him, no matter whether Zhou Weiqing was willing
                                            or not, he would not let it go so easily.</p>
                                        <p>Beaming with delight, he looked on at Zhou Weiqing, whose face was respectful
                                            but eyes swirling around in his sockets. The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor
                                            smiled and said: “From now on, you are my only disciple. Your name is Zhou
                                            Weiqing right, Zhou Little Fatty, Little Fatty being Large Fatty’s disciple,
                                            how nice. This old man’s face is Long Shiya. Remember clearly, in the
                                            future, if you meet any trouble, do you still need to report the name of the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace? Just use this old man’s name, and see who dares
                                            touch you, and I will tear out his tendons and flay his skin. Hahahahaha.”
                                            Finally getting a disciple that satisfied his requirements, this big hearted
                                            Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor who had always did what he pleased could no
                                            longer hold back and burst out laughing heartily, carefree.</p>
                                        <p>“Come, your teacher has to speak to you. The rest of you, wait here.” As he
                                            said that, Long Shiya grabbed Zhou Weiqing’s shoulders with one hand, and
                                            the rest of the group felt their eyes blur before them, and the two
                                            disappeared.</p>
                                        <p>It was not the Blink Skill that Zhou Weiqing was so familiar with, but he
                                            felt as if his surroundings blurred around him and after an instant, when
                                            the surroundings seemed to come clear again, both he and Long Shiya appeared
                                            in a tent.</p>
                                        <p>This tent was much larger and grandiose than the one they had been resting
                                            in. The floor was lined with thick animal furs, though he could not tell
                                            which animal they had come from. There were four braziers around the tent
                                            warming the tent into a comfortable temperature, and there was a large table
                                            which was filled with all sorts of different delicious look foods and
                                            fruits.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya sat down at the side of the table and said: “Come, let’s sit, eat
                                            while we speak. With me, you do not need to be so formal or restricted,
                                            after all, it is just us two master and disciple, not any large sect. As
                                            long as you don’t anger this old man, you can do whatever you want. Even if
                                            you want to knock down the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, this old man will
                                            support you all the way.”</p>
                                        <p>Being forced to become someone’s disciple might not be something that made
                                            anyone happy.</p>
                                        <p>However, Zhou Weiqing’s manner of thinking had always been different from
                                            normal. For him, it was just like if a beautiful woman was being *ahemed*,
                                            and was unable to resist, then he would just choose to enjoy it, rather than
                                            suffer extra unnecessary harm.</p>
                                        <p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing was a very optimistic person, and a large
                                            portion of time he would always think of the best outcomes. This time was no
                                            exception; everything else aside, after he had become Long Shiya’s disciple,
                                            from the words of this new teacher of his, he could tell that he truly liked
                                            him, and was extremely protective to boot.</p>
                                        <p>As a disciple, who wouldn’t like his teacher to be protective? Perhaps others
                                            might not, but Zhou Weiqing definitely loved that. Furthermore, his new
                                            teacher was a Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse.</p>
                                        <p>“Master, you don’t belong to any Sect? Or any of the Great Saint Lands?” Zhou
                                            Weiqing asked curiously.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya shook his head and said: “This old man has always been alone, all
                                            the way from a young age I have been solitary, and up until now that is
                                            still true. Well, at least now I’ll have someone now that I have you as a
                                            disciple. All my life, I have spent everything on cultivating and training,
                                            and I have not thought of anything else. Alright, enough about me. What
                                            about you? If I have not guessed wrongly, your teacher should be from the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect right?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “No!”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya started momentarily before saying: “No?” Taking a deep look at
                                            Zhou Weiqing, he said: “Little brat, I might not mind other things, but if
                                            you lie to me, I will definitely punish you. If you are not from the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect, is that controllable Demonic Change State and Devour
                                            Skill fake? Don’t think I do not know what those two skills mean to the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect? You should be the next Sect Master in training for the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect right?”</p>
                                        <p>“Master, I really am not.” Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile. As such, he
                                            began to simply speak of all his experiences from the start of his
                                            cultivation.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, even Long Shiya with his vast knowledge and experience was
                                            in shock, and he couldn’t help but exclaim: “That’s actually possible?! Just
                                            eating some pearl and you got six Attributes? Little brat, your luck is
                                            indeed unbelievable. Although this old man also has six Attributes, I can’t
                                            even remember how much suffering I went through in training, how I had to
                                            hide and be so secretive… Before I became strong, I was so afraid about
                                            others learning about my multiple Attributes. Just in terms of Skill Storing
                                            and Consolidating Equipment, it took me so much time and effort… In fact,
                                            only after the age of fifty did I actually dare to show myself in the
                                            mainland. Sigh… comparisons are odious indeed! Haha! Well, this is a good
                                            thing though, in future, you will definitely surpass that Old Xue fellow.
                                            Heh heh, come, let me see that Yin Fire in your body.”</p>
                                        <p>As he said that, he placed his hands on Zhou Weiqing’s wrist, extending his
                                            senses into his meridians. However, when he did so, he was stunned once
                                            again. That was because he could not sense any sign of hidden injuries or
                                            the yin fire within his body.</p>
                                        <p>“Impossible! Han Tianyou clearly sent the yin fire into your body, how could
                                            there be no sign of it at all? You injured him so heavily, with his
                                            character, he would never let you go. My senses cannot be wrong!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Teacher, you don’t need to think so much. In
                                            truth, that is because I am immune to all Fire Attribute powers.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya looked at him and gave an exasperated grunt. “Immune your head!
                                            You’re just at the Four Jeweled cultivation level, can you possibly be
                                            immune to a Heavenly King Stage Yin Fire? I don’t believe you.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Of course I can’t on my own. However, there is a unique
                                            power in my body, I think its called something like Solidified Dragon
                                            Spirit. It is also of the Fire Attribute, and definitely of a higher level
                                            than a Heavenly King Stage. That is the reason why I am immune to most Fire
                                            Attribute powers.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya’s jaw dropped. “What?! Solidified Dragon Spirit?? Where did you
                                            meet a Dragon?” He was so agitated that he grabbed hold onto Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            arm.</p>
                                        <p>“Teacher, softer…” Zhou Weiqing hurriedly cried out in pain.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya quickly let go of his arm, looking at Zhou Weiqing, his fat face
                                            with a very strange expression. He did not even know what to say. Demonic
                                            Change State, Solidified Dragon Spirit. Any of these powers were powers that
                                            any Heavenly Jewel Master would dream to have! Perhaps the Demonic Change
                                            State might be some cause of trouble due to being of the Evil Attribute, but
                                            Zhou Weiqing could control his! As for the Solidified Dragon Spirit, that
                                            was even more impressive. Even the hundred year old Long Shiya had only
                                            heard of the legends, but never actually seen a Heavenly Jewel Master with
                                            one. Only a mortal enemy of his had actually a similar power to the
                                            Solidified Dragon Spirit.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not have anything to hide from Long Shiya, and he quickly
                                            explained the whole process about how he gained the Solidified Dragon
                                            Spirit.</p>
                                        <p>“Hmph, little brat, no wonder you wanted to bet with me, you already knew you
                                            would win. Luckily, this old man didn’t fall for it.” Long Shiya gave a cold
                                            humph, but he was actually grinning deep in his heart. <i>This time, I have
                                                really picked up a true gem! Hahahaha!</i></p>
                                        <p>Indeed, he had definitely picked up a gem, but the Heavenly Demon Sect and
                                            the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had both suffered a huge loss. No matter the
                                            Heavenly Demon Sect or the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, both had been counting
                                            on their status as Great Saint Lands, and though they had tried to recruit
                                            Zhou Weiqing, they would ultimately not do the same like Long Shiya to
                                            directly force him to join them, due to their pride as Great Saint Lands.
                                            Alas, this allowed Long Shiya to get a step ahead to gain him as a
                                            disciple.</p>
