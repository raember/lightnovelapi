                                            extremely dense longspear of ice transformed into countless specks of light,
                                            then disappeared.  This was what happened when Saint Energy was used to
                                            activate the upgraded version of Spatial Rend, Spatial Collapse.</p>
                                        <p>As for that feline Heavenly Beast, it was the evolved version of the control
                                            technique, ‘Absolute Delay’!</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing released Skills, he no longer emanated particularly
                                            powerful auras from his body.  He looked just like an ordinary person waving
                                            his hand, but the process didn’t slow down in the slightest.</p>
                                        <p>After sweeping out with his arms, he didn’t retract them.  Instead, he took
                                            advantage of the brief moment where Shangguan Tianyue was affected by the
                                            Absolute Delay to rapidly point with both hands, his fingers stabbing out
                                            like butterflies drifting through flowers.  Over on Shangguan Tianyue’s
                                            side, a series of azure lightning bolts began to light up. Twelve
                                            consecutive Fetters of Wind landed upon him!</p>
                                        <p>What sort of casting speed was this?!  Although this looked like the Six
                                            Ultimate Godly Light Formation which Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long
                                            Shiya had developed based on the Six Ultimate Heavenly Dao Formation, in
                                            reality Zhou Weiqing was relying on his Saint Energy.  The way in which he
                                            used these techniques was completely different from how Six Ultimate
                                            Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya used them.</p>
                                        <p>Simply put, the same Fetters of Wind technique was now at least four times
                                            more powerful in Zhou Weiqing’s hands than those of an equivalent-level
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master.  This was a 7 Star rated technique which when used by
                                            him had the effect of a 10 Star technique. When these twelve Fetters of Wind
                                            fell upon Shangguan Tianyue, it wasn’t easy for him to break free even
                                            though he was a Heavenly Emperor.</p>
                                        <p>Although it was impossible for him to summon atmospheric energies from the
                                            outside world here, the local atmospheric energies were still quite dense.
                                             Zhou Weiqing didn’t pause after unleashing twelve Fetters of Wind. He
                                            flipped over his palms, then placed them facing each other. The spectators
                                            could all see the blue-violet light shining between his palms.  In the next
                                            instant, an enormous lightning dragon burst forth from his palms and shot
                                            straight at Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
                                        <p>The lightning moved incredibly fast.  Even though it was now in the shape of
                                            a great dragon, it didn’t lose this intrinsic property.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue had been caught off-guard and thrown off-balance by the
                                            Absolute Delay and the Fetters of Wind.  Before he had managed to completely
                                            break free, Zhou Weiqing’s lightning dragon had arrived.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, he put his power as a Heavenly Emperor on full display.
                                             Although he had yet to fully extricate himself from the Fetters of Wind,
                                            his eyes flashed and a translucent, crystalline shield of ice appeared
                                            before him.  This ice shield was three meters in diameter, and it securely
                                            covered his entire body. Just because he couldn’t move didn’t mean he
                                            couldn’t cast Skills.</p>
                                        <p>However, Zhou Weiqing’s control over his lightning dragon technique wasn’t
                                            that simple either.  Right as the great lightning dragon was about to
                                            collide against the ice shield, it suddenly twisted aside to dodge the
                                            shield and still blasted against Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
                                        <p>An enormous explosion rang out.  A layer of blue-violet light appeared across
                                            Shangguan Tianyue’s entire body.  He had finally managed to break free from
                                            the Fetters of the Wind, but now a powerful numbing sensation pervaded his
                                            entire body.</p>
                                        <p>This lightning dragon technique was something Zhou Weiqing had created after
                                            simulating and testing out multiple variations of Lightning Suffering.  Not
                                            even Long Shiya, who had the Lightning Attribute, would be able to do this
                                            because he wasn’t strengthened by Saint Energy!</p>
                                        <p>Black light suddenly descended upon the area.  This black light had actually
                                            come from beneath Shangguan Tianyue’s feet, and it manifested itself in the
                                            form of a six-cornered black star.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue, as a Heavenly Emperor, had an incredibly tough body.
                                             Although Zhou Weiqing had landed the attack, it didn’t actually injure him.
                                             However, this black light was simply too fast. He hadn’t had a chance to
                                            break free from the numbness.  A black-red light suddenly flashed about his
                                            head, coming together to form a strange glyph.</p>
                                        <p>This was the Curse of Doom.  Of course, it had also been strengthened.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing didn’t even pause as he used these techniques.  It can be said
                                            that they all came out one after the other, and each of them was
                                            tremendously powerful.</p>
                                        <p>After the Curse of Doom, his movements slowed down for just a brief moment as
                                            he pressed his hands together across his chest, then pushed them outwards in
                                            an arc while unleashing a dense blast of silver light.  By the time his
                                            hands were completely unfolded, a Silver Emperor suddenly flew out. It
                                            instantly accelerated through the skies, piercing forward at lightning
                                            speed. Next, a Silver Emperor Wing Slash fused with the Spatial Rend to
                                            produce the Fusion Skill, Silver Emperor Spatial Rend.  It almost instantly
                                            charged over to Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
                                        <p>The joss stick had only burned down a tiny amount thus far, but during that
                                            brief period of time Zhan Lingtian’s back had already been drenched by
                                            sweat.  Aside from awe, he was unable to feel any other emotions. No matter
                                            what, he never would’ve imagined that Zhou Weiqing would reach such a level
                                            that he could actually suppress Shangguan Tianyue.  He wasn’t a weakling,
                                            and he was very familiar with the two Palace Masters. He could tell that
                                            aside from not using the Legendary Set, Shangguan Tianyue wasn’t holding
                                            back at all. And yet, he was still being suppressed by Zhou Weiqing!</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang, who stood next to Zhan Lingtian, hadn’t revealed a smile
                                            after his first one had vanished.  His understanding of the battle was
                                            naturally much deeper than Zhan Lingtian’s. These techniques Zhou Weiqing
                                            were using… although they were his, they were completely reliant upon being
                                            cast through the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation.  In other words, these
                                            were all simulated techniques but just as strong as the real ones.</p>
                                        <p>A dazzling streak of golden light suddenly burst forth from Shangguan
                                            Tianyue’s body.  The light appeared around his chest, causing him to be
                                            filled with a godlike aura. It actually managed to instantly dispel the
                                            numbing effect as well as the Curse of Doom.  His eyes flashed with divine
                                            light as he spat out a streak of golden light which transformed into a
                                            golden knife that clashed head-on against the Silver Emperor.</p>
                                        <p>An enormous explosion rang out, resulting in the Silver Emperor falling
                                            backwards while Shangguan Tianyue’s shoulders trembled slightly.  He had
                                            been at a disadvantage and had just barely managed to unleash that Skills,
                                            and so he didn’t manage to actually destroy the Silver Emperor.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing didn’t let up with his attacks at all.  After the Silver Emperor
                                            flew out, his hands and his back actually began to glow with two completely
                                            types of light.</p>
                                        <p>The light coming from his back was purple-red, while his two hands were
                                            glowing dark-purple.  As these two streaks of light were formed and flew
                                            out, his movements finally paused for a moment.  However, his technique was
                                            completed just as Shangguan Tianyue beat back the Silver Emperor.</p>
                                        <p>Six wings flapped violently as the Hell’s Angel soared into the skies.  This
                                            was what had been materialized from the dark-purple light, and as emerged it
                                            came to hover five meters in front of Zhou Weiqing.  Countless globes of
                                            dark-violet light burst from it, smashing towards Shangguan Tianyue as the
                                            Silver Emperor attacked a second time from the side.</p>
                                        <p>Just at this moment, a human figure with a serpent’s tail and a devilish face
                                            suddenly flew out from Zhou Weiqing’s back.  A beam of violet-red light shot
                                            out from its eyes and burst towards Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
                                        <p>This had all happened in mere seconds.  Zhou Weiqing had actually
                                            successfully revived the Silver Emperor, Hell’s Angel, and the Demonic
                                            Dragon Lady.  These three powerful creatures simultaneously launched attacks
                                            at Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s attacks finally came to a temporary pause after he completed
                                            these three revivals.  Reviving the Hell’s Angel and the Silver Emperor was
                                            easy, as both were at the Heavenly King stage.  Given his cultivation, he
                                            could complete their revivals with ease. The Demonic Dragon Lady, however,
                                            was a Heavenly Beast who was a Max Level Heavenly Emperor.  Reviving it had
                                            been quite taxing for Zhou Weiqing. Even the Astral Saint Core Nucleus in
                                            his chest dimmed slightly.</p>
                                        <p>However, this actually showed how powerful Zhou Weiqing was.  Although the
                                            Astral Saint Core Nucleus in his chest had dimmed slightly, the golden aura
                                            around his body had grown markedly stronger.  All types of atmospheric
                                            energies in the air were being pulled into him at incredible speeds. In
                                            fact, not even the two Heavenly Emperors were far from being his match when
                                            it came to controlling atmospheric energies.</p>
                                        <p>When Shangguan Tianyue pushed back the Silver Emperor and then saw the Hell’s
                                            Angel and the Demonic Dragon Lady appear, he momentarily felt as though the
                                            person he was facing was the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor himself.</p>
                                        <p>This was supposed to be a contest to see if Zhou Weiqing could survive for
                                            the time needed to burn a joss stick, but this entire time it was Shangguan
                                            Tianyue who was being beaten up.  He wasn’t trying to hold back on purpose!
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s techniques simply came out far too quickly, and they included
                                            so many different Attributes. He also was able to control all of the
                                            techniques perfectly, allowing him to keep Shangguan Tianyue completely
                                            off-balance.</p>
                                        <p>His mindset had originally been that of a senior providing guidance to a
                                            junior, but now it had completely changed.  This kid was far more freakishly
                                            talented than he had imagined.</p>
                                        <p>Ordinary Heavenly Kings would probably be terrified even before the battle
                                            started if they knew they had to face a Heavenly Emperor, but Zhou Weiqing
                                            was not.  He had just returned from the Xuantian Continent. Forget about
                                            Heavenly Emperors, he had even battled Heavenly Gods. In his heart, he
                                            didn’t feel the slightest bit of nervousness.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing himself had been suppressing his temper for quite some time.
                                             <em>Heaven’s Expanse Palace wanted to use this sort of trickery to prevent
                                                me from wedding Xue’er, right?  Fine. I’ll use my power to shut their
                                                mouths</em>.</p>
                                        <p>A layer of blurry golden light shot out from Shangguan Tianyue, blocking the
                                            Hell’s Angel’s attack.  At the same time, Shangguan Tianyue folded his hands
                                            together, then spread them apart. His right hand now had a long golden sword
                                            within it.</p>
                                        <p>The longsword was around 1.1 meters long and three fingers wide.  An image of
                                            an enormous dragon appeared behind Shangguan Tianyue as well, and it spat
                                            out golden light which blocked the Dragon Silencing Seal which the Demonic
                                            Dragon Lady had shot out from its eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Shanguan Tianyue’s Elemental Jewels were also of many different Attributes,
                                            but the strongest one without question was ‘Light’.  The sword in his hand
                                            and the light dragon behind him were his most powerful techniques, Skills
                                            which he had Stored from a Heavenly God-level Heavenly Beast, the Holy Light
                                            Dragon.  The Holy Light Dragon was the guardian Heavenly Beast for Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace, and its position was similar to the Tenebrous Demon Dragon
                                            of Xuantian Palace.</p>
                                        <p>Thanks to this mighty technique, he finally managed to find his footing and
                                            defend against Zhou Weiqing’s consecutive attacks.</p>
                                        <p>A true Heavenly God Stored Skill was naturally not something a
                                            pseudo-Heavenly God like the Demonic Dragon Lady’s could compare to.  In
                                            addition, the Demonic Dragon Lady herself was partially a Darkness Attribute
                                            creature, as was the Hell’s Angel. Both were countered to a certain degree
                                            by the Light Attribute.  Shanguan Tianyue’s aura suddenly increased in
                                            might, sweeping out and transforming into a layer of almost physical golden
                                            light which thundered towards those two revived Heavenly Beasts.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue didn’t immediately attack, which was why Zhou Weiqing had
                                            been able to catch him off-guard with a series of attacks.  He needed to
                                            first catch his breath. This was especially true with Zhou Weiqing furiously
                                            sucking the atmospheric energies from the surrounding world.  If he wasn’t
                                            able to assert some control, he probably wouldn’t be able to replenish his
                                            energy at all.</p>
                                        <p>The Silver Emperor flew towards him from the side, while the Demonic Dragon
                                            Lady and the Hell’s Angel were standing in front of Zhou Weiqing.  What was
                                            Zhou Weiqing going to do?</p>
                                        <p>His hands were slightly crooked and began to form an arc before his chest,
                                            maintaining a circle within his hands at all time.  The glowing light on his
                                            body grew even stronger, and the golden ribbons began to spread out from
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s body and coiled around him.</p>
                                        <p>Even though Shangguan Tianyue’s Heavenly God technique was able to
                                            continuously emanate an aura of might, it didn’t have any effect on Zhou
                                            Weiqing at all.  As the ribbons of light appeared, the entirety of the drill
                                            grounds began to shudder.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang was badly shocked.  He hurriedly exerted his Heavenly
                                            Energy to protect this plane, but he could clearly sense that a terrifying
                                            sucking power had exploded from Zhou Weiqing’s body which was draining away
                                            even his own Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue was even more stunned, because as the surrounding plane had
                                            trembled, he found that he was actually unable to draw upon any of the
                                            atmospheric energies from this region.  It was as though they had found a
                                            master, and they were all furiously pouring to him.</p>
                                        <p>A Heavenly Emperor just had all the local atmospheric energies stolen away by
                                            a Heavenly King.  This had completely upended Shangguan Tianyue’s
                                            understanding of the world.</p>
                                        <p>He didn’t dare to continue to try and recover.  Without atmospheric energies
                                            replenishing him, he wasn’t able to recover much strength at all.
                                             Regardless of how Zhou Weiqing had done this, the best solution was for
                                            Shangguan Tianyue to end this as soon as possible.</p>
                                        <p>Gold light flashed.  Shangguan Tianyue charged towards the Demonic Dragon
                                            Lady and the Hell’s Angel, meeting their unceasing attacks.  The powerful
                                            aura of this Holy Light Dragon made it so that he was able to completely
                                            dominate these two revival techniques in terms of aura.</p>
                                        <p>An absolutely awesome blade of light slashed out, slicing through the Hell’s
                                            Angel and causing it to vanish within the light.  This was what often
                                            happened when darkness and light clashed, and the difference in cultivation
                                            levels made it impossible to overcome.</p>
                                        <p>However, even as the Hell’s Angel fell beneath this sword, an absolutely
                                            awesome wave of Demonic energy instantly exploded from behind it.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue had relied on his Holy Light Dragon’s supportive aura to
                                            give him the absolute advantage, as it prevented the Hell’s Angel and the
                                            Demonic Dragon Lady from using their full power.  However, right at this
                                            moment, Shangguan Tianyue felt all of the energies in his body suddenly come
                                            to a halt. A Demonic aura which caused the deepest parts of his soul to
                                            quiver had just appeared out of nowhere, smashing down upon him like a
                                            staff.</p>
                                        <p><em>What was this?</em>  Shangguan Tianyue’s face had a look of complete
                                            shock on it.  Was this the Demonic Dragon Lady’s aura? Impossible,
                                            absolutely impossible.  Even if the actual Demonic Dragon Lady was here, she
                                            wouldn’t be a match for him, much less generate such a terrifying energy
                                            ripple.  But if it wasn’t the Demonic Dragon Lady, then who was it?</p>
                                        <p>Right behind the Demonic Dragon Lady was a gray figure which was slowly
                                            increasing in size.  By the time the gray figure had truly emerged, the
                                            entire drill grounds seemed to quiver slightly in terror.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing continued to hover there.  They could clearly see that those
                                            ribbons of light swirling around him were continuously sucking in
                                            atmospheric energies, including the energies of this very plane.  The
                                            Demonic energy was coming from his back, and as it took form the dim golden
                                            light that had been around Zhou Weiqing suddenly turned completely gray, but
                                            it was still tinged with astral specks.</p>
                                        <p>Even the Demonic Dragon Lady behind him had actually been stained the same
                                            color of gray.  The Demonic Dragon Lady was trembling slightly, an extremely
                                            excited look on her face as her aura skyrocketed explosively.  She no longer
                                            feared the Holy Light Sword in Shangguan Tianyue’s hands or the Holy Light
                                            Dragon’s aura.</p>
                                        <p>“Milord father-in-law, please be careful,” Zhou Weiqing said leisurely, and
                                            then those purple-red beams of light shot out from the Demonic Dragon Lady’s
                                            eyes once more.  This time, the Holy Light Dragon’s light was actually
                                            unable to stop it, allowing it to descend upon Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
