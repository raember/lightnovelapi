                                            slaughter. Instantly, the Sixteenth Regiment soldiers froze in place, not
                                            daring to move a muscle. It was clear that the previous salvo of arrows was
                                            a warning, and if they dared move past that row of arrows, those ruffians of
                                            the Peerless Battalion would not hesitate to actually fire.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense which direction Shen Bu was attempting to
                                            wheel around and charge from. His right hand was still holding on to the
                                            Heavy Cavalry Battalion Commander, while his left hand struck out towards
                                            Shen Bu, a brilliant green light emitting from his palm. Once again, he did
                                            not use his Stored Skills, making use of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation
                                            Arts to mimic a Skill again.</p>
                                        <p>In the flash of green light, Shen Bu found that she was suddenly unable to
                                            move. It was the Fetters of Wind, the Control Skill of the Wind Attribute!
                                            The Fetters of Wind had been unleashed using his Six Ultimate Skill
                                            Manipulation Arts.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since he had seen his teacher use that Skill months ago, Zhou Weiqing
                                            had spent a lot of time over the past six months in mimicking that Skill. At
                                            this point, he was already able to continuously unleash it, given sufficient
                                            Heavenly Energy, without any cooldown at all. This was the true essence and
                                            power of the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts!</p>
                                        <p>The Fetters of Wind was after all a Seven Star rated Skill, and its drain on
                                            Heavenly Energy was not inconsiderable. However, do not forget that Zhou
                                            Weiqing was currently not fully using his own personal Heavenly Energy, as
                                            he was still in the midst of Devouring that Heavy Cavalry Battalion
                                            Commander’s Heavenly Energy. It could be said that he was completely using
                                            his opponent’s Heavenly Energy, converting it into his own Wind Attribute
                                            Heavenly Energy to power a continuous series of Fetters of Wind to restrict
                                            Shen Bu.</p>
                                        <p>When she was first hit by one Fetters of Wind, Shen Bu did not make much of
                                            it. After all, she had fought with Zhou Weiqing before and knew that he had
                                            such a Skill. The Heavenly Energy gap between the two of them was still
                                            pretty considerable, and she was confident that if she used all her strength
                                            to break free, she could only be restricted for a second.</p>
                                        <p>However, she soon realised that something was very wrong, as Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            second Fetters of Wind soon fell on her almost instantly as she broke free
                                            of the first, as if almost before she had even broken free. Once again, her
                                            body froze in place, unable to move.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, Zhou Weiqing was already very close to Shen Bu, and a
                                            disdainful smirk crossed his lips as he said passively: “Regiment Commander
                                            Shen Bu, you were no match for me previously, and the result will be no
                                            different now. Do you really think that my previous win over you was just
                                            luck?”</p>
                                        <p>As he was speaking, Zhou Weiqing had already used his fifth Fetters of Wind.
                                            With an abrupt strike out of his left palm, he dis-compassionately released
                                            a Lightning Explosive Palm.</p>
                                        <p>Another huge explosion, and Shen Bu’s body was sent flying back by his blow.
                                            With Shen Bu’s cultivation level, such a blow was not sufficient to actually
                                            injure her seriously, but having her entire body numbed was definitely not a
                                            good feeling. Furthermore, she had been sent flying so easily in front of so
                                            many people.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, her rage had already reached a boiling point, and by now she
                                            had already dismissed all her previous qualms and misgivings. As soon as she
                                            landed on the ground, she charged forward once more, all of her Consolidated
                                            Equipment releasing out at once, the Flame Blade in her hands glowing
                                            brilliantly. In that moment, she looked as if she was ready to pit her life
                                            against Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>However, without warning, a huge man intercepted her, looking like a mountain
                                            range towering over her.</p>
                                        <p>A massive, heavy shield blocked her Flame Blade with a loud slamming sound,
                                            insurmountable natural chasm.</p>
                                        <p>*PENG* Shen Bu felt as if she had struck an immovable rock, the sheer shock
                                            wave from the backlash causing her to stagger back a few steps before she
                                            regained her balance.</p>
                                        <p>At last, she could see that man clearly. A tall, muscular man dressed in
                                            simple army uniform. His features were simple and plain, looking to be about
                                            thirty years of age, and his tough, stout face was clearly lined in the
                                            bright sun. Standing there, his aura was strong and stable, almost
                                            unfathomable like a deep chasm or a tall mountain, that seemed to even
                                            surpass Zhou Weiqing’s. Six Heavenly Jewels spun around his wrists, and that
                                            massive shield was held at an angle in front of his body. The sheer size of
                                            the shield could fully cover even that huge body of his. On the shield, the
                                            obvious six sockets inlying it almost shocked Shen Bu as the visage entered
                                            her eyes.</p>
                                        <p>“Get lost!” Shen Bu howled in rage as she charged forward abruptly again, the
                                            Flame Blade in her hands striking out in a flurry of angry blows.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, the person blocking her was Lin TianAo. As soon as Zhou
                                            Weiqing took action, how could he be any slower, and he had rushed forward
                                            immediately, just in time to block Shen Bu’s crazed attack.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo’s Six-Jewel Assembly Set Shield was not something that Shen Bu
                                            could easily break. Previously, when they were facing the Heavenly King
                                            Stage powerhouse Han Tianyou, Lin TianAo was still able to block him for a
                                            short time, and that was more than enough to speak for his capabilities. Lin
                                            TianAo’s offensive capabilities were indeed severely lacking, but in terms
                                            of defense, he was far beyond any Heavenly Jewel Master of the same level,
                                            even those powerhouses from the Great Saint Lands. After all, his personal
                                            Ultimate Defense Attributes was highly complemented by the six-Jewel
                                            Assembly Set Shield.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo’s shield only moved in extremely small movements, and his steps
                                            did not seem fast at all. However, every time he moved at all, he seemed to
                                            be able to easily block Shen Bu’s movement, not any direct block, but in an
                                            angle that she was unable to use her strength in.</p>
                                        <p>Blocking out. A high level positioning technique that Lin TianAo had trained
                                            in with years of battle experience behind his belt, extremely powerful no
                                            matter against humans or Heavenly Beasts. He had trained and cultivated for
                                            so many years, the majority of which had been studying, analysing and
                                            researching on how to best improve his defense in any possible way. Not just
                                            through taking blows, but also movement, blocking out techniques, and his
                                            own personal defenses. It could be said that all of that was already
                                            ingrained into his muscle memory, and using it in varied combat situations
                                            was as easy as breathing for him. Shen Bu was attacking with all her might,
                                            but in front of Lin TianAo, she felt as if all her strength was useless in
                                            front of him, being unable to actually use any of her power properly. Lin
                                            TianAo did not even retaliate, just using his shield to constantly block all
                                            her movement and attacks, and she felt as if she were stuck in a muck, not
                                            able to reach Zhou Weiqing despite her best efforts. Lin TianAo was like a
                                            castle wall, no matter how hard she tried to batter him down, he stood tall
                                            and strong.”</p>
                                        <p>“Stop!” All of a sudden, Zhou Weiqing shouted out loud.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo’s six-Jeweled Assembly Shield Set suddenly changed, a brilliant
                                            yellow light shooting forth, and a powerful shock wave shoved Shen Bu back.
                                            Clearly, he had been holding back in the fight again Shen Bu.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu panted hard as she turned to look at Zhou Weiqing, who had currently
                                            thrown the Heavy Cavalry Battalion Commander to the ground and had his foot
                                            on him. On the side of the Sixteenth Regiment, they all had angry looks on
                                            their faces upon seeing that. However, on the side of the Peerless
                                            Battalion, more and more of the soldiers were coming out of their tents. To
                                            their shock, all of the Peerless Battalion soldiers were dressed in the same
                                            full mail, with fine longbows drawn and arrows pointed at them.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the Peerless Battalion soldiers whose eyes were filled with
                                            killing intent, as well as the chilling light from the rows of arrows, none
                                            of the Sixteenth Regiment soldiers dared make a move. Unless they could
                                            somehow call for reinforcements, they knew they would be of no match at
                                            all.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glared coldly at Shen Bu and said: “Regiment Commander Shen Bu,
                                            I’ll give you one last chance. Hand over those two who critically injured my
                                            brother here, and all of you cut off a finger. Otherwise, all of you can
                                            forget about leaving.”</p>
                                        <p>After attacking for so long, Shen Bu had already vented much of her anger,
                                            and she was steadily growing calmer. This was the first time she had seen
                                            Lin TianAo, but his sheer power had definitely giving her a deep impression.
                                            She could sense that even if her Senior Brother Shen Ji was here, even he
                                            might not be able to break this man’s defenses.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, the Peerless Battalion soldiers were all arrayed in neat
                                            formations, their bows drawn and their killing intent clear. If they all
                                            released their arrows at the same time, casualties would definitely number
                                            in the hundreds. “Zhou Weiqing, you dare to fire on your allies? Aren’t you
                                            afraid of being charged in military court?” Shen Bu threatened in an angry
                                            cry.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a disdainful humph. “Don’t talk to me about military court.
                                            Hmph. I’m afraid the first one to be court martialed will be you. Let me ask
                                            you, whose camp is this? This is our Peerless Battalion’s camp. It is your
                                            Sixteenth Regiment soldiers who have come here to cause trouble, and we are
                                            just defending ourselves legitimately. As for death? Do you think only your
                                            men dying is considered as death? My brother dying here is not considered?
                                            Furthermore, who is the one who started it all? Who left all the rubbish
                                            here? My words will not change, I will give you a minute to decide, and if
                                            you think I am joking, don’t blame me for being vicious.” As he spoke, he
                                            began to exert more pressure on his leg, and the Heavy Cavalry Battalion
                                            Commander grunted in pain, his armour already changing shape from the sheer
                                            pressure.</p>
                                        <p>“You…” Shen Bu was so angry that her entire body was trembling. However, she
                                            was at a total loss about what to do. If she were to give in now, how would
                                            she command the Sixteenth Regiment in the future? It would be tantamount to
                                            the entire Sixteenth Regiment bowing down to a mere Ruffian Battalion, and
                                            they would never be able to hold their heads up high any longer. Yet, if she
                                            did not give in, if this continued progressing onwards, let alone being on
                                            the upper hand, it was likely she would not have any good ending. That Zhou
                                            Weiqing had the Heaven’s Expanse Palace background, even the northern army
                                            command might not be able to actually deal with them.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, Shen Bu was starting to regret her actions, regret that she
                                            did not listen to her Senior Brother’s words. Shen Ji had warned her long
                                            ago not to provoke Zhou Weiqing. After all, they were from the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace, and such a background was not something they could take on.
                                            Alas, the two sisters Shen Bu and Shen Yi just could not suppress the anger
                                            within them.</p>
                                        <p>Who knew, things would reach such a stage, and it was almost impossible for
                                            them to back down in a good way now.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, a loud, drunken sounding voice rang out. “What are all of
                                            you doing? It’s so early in the morning, and you all are already making so
                                            much noise?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing that voice, Zhou Weiqing’s killing intent lessened slightly, the
                                            anger in his face subsiding as he turned around.</p>
                                        <p>The one who spoke, and just arrived, was his teacher, the Six Ultimate
                                            Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya. Furthermore, right beside him was another
                                            teacher of his… Mu En.</p>
                                        <p>Mu En glanced towards Zhou Weiqing, a sly look on his face. The two of them
                                            had walked in linked shoulder to shoulder, swaying side to side as they did
                                            so. The two looked totally like a pair of old drunks who had too much to
                                            drink the night before. From appearance, Mu En looked even older than Long
                                            Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>“Teacher.” Zhou Weiqing bowed slightly to the pair.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya gave him a hard look, saying exasperatedly: “Early in the morning
                                            and you’re disrupting our beauty sleep, how irritating. However, Weiqing,
                                            you really do have a good master! No wonder you turned out into such a sly
                                            little brat.” As he said that, he clapped Mu En on the shoulder. From the
                                            look of it, the two of them seemed like old friends who had not seen each
                                            other for years.</p>
