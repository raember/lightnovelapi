                                        <p>However, the thing that had shocked the new recruits the most would
                                            definitely be when Shangguan Fei’er and the strongest hundred of the older
                                            Peerless Battalion soldiers had started helping those new recruits who had
                                            not Awakened their Personal Jewels to do so.</p>
                                        <p>In just the mere short two months of time, the entire Peerless Battalion, all
                                            five thousand odd of them had already Awakened their Power Jewels. Such a
                                            magnificent feat was truly unbelievable. After completing that, Shangguan
                                            Fei’er had been so exhausted that she fell ill for three days before
                                            recovering. By this time, her prestige in the Peerless Battalion had reached
                                            such a height that rivaled or perhaps even exceeded Zhou Weiqing, who had
                                            not appeared for two months. No matter how arrogant or unbridled ruffians
                                            were, they were still humans with feelings, and the gratitude they held for
                                            Shangguan Fei’er was in their hearts. Furthermore, this military instructor
                                            of theirs was so beautiful, and it could be said that she had become the
                                            Goddess in the hearts of the entire Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Despite their advancements, the Peerless Battalion definitely still needed
                                            much time to continue growing. The current five thousand men were still far
                                            from the unity that the original one thousand five hundred held, and what
                                            they needed was time to work together and develop feelings. Of course, time
                                            waited for no man… according to reports from scouts, the WanShou Empire was
                                            already starting to gather their troops. The time for the annual attacks
                                            would soon come, and it would also be the time for the Peerless Battalion to
                                            truly ascend their stage for the first time.</p>
                                        <p>… ...</p>
                                        <p>The snow gleamed white, covering the entire mountain peaks. The temperature
                                            was extremely cold, more than forty degrees below zero.</p>
                                        <p>One did not even need to drip water to form ice, even exhaling a breath could
                                            form little ice particles that dropped down to the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Right on the top of the snowy mountain peak, there was a massive old castle.
                                            The castle was totally white, as if it had been fully carved out of ice.</p>
                                        <p>The castle seemed to be conjoined with the peak itself, rising far up and
                                            above. From the distance, when there was sunlight, it seemed as if it was
                                            adorned with a halo of gold.</p>
                                        <p>The tranquil peak of this majestic snowy mountain, with only the shrill sound
                                            of wind around. This was the heart of the entire WanShou Empire… the grand
                                            temple and sanctuary of the WanShou Empire hearts. The Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, this was the Heavenly Snow Mountain, one of the five Great Saint
                                            Lands. Here, the Strongest in the world resided.</p>
                                        <p>No one dared to come here easily to offend the owner of the castle. In the
                                            WanShou Empire, the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord was like a god. In
                                            fact, he did have the power of the Heavenly God Tier… amongst the entire
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master powerhouses of the land, he was the only one who had
                                            reached the Heavenly God Tier! Undefeated!</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord had already reached such a stage for
                                            several dozen years. Legend spoke that if not for the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace having a large number of powerhouses, as well as the Blood Red Hell
                                            and Passion Valley supporting the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, along with the
                                            Boundless Infinitum Set and the sheer wealth of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace…
                                            perhaps the Heavenly Snow Mountain would be the First amongst the Great
                                            Saint Lands. More so… the WanShou Empire would have been led by them to
                                            conquer the entire world.</p>
                                        <p>There was a saying in the WanShou Empire: In the hearts of the WanShou Empire
                                            citizens, there was a mountain in everyone’s heart, a Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain. From that, one could imagine what kind of status the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain held in the WanShou Empire.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>In any case, currently, this stately Heavenly Snow Mountain had two visitors,
                                            and they were climbing up towards the peak with much difficulty.</p>
                                        <p>To be more accurate, it was not two men climbing, but one climbing as he
                                            carried the other on his back.</p>
                                        <p>The two men were extremely large and muscular, with faint greenish grey fur
                                            barely visible around their bodies. The one climbing looked to be rather
                                            old, his ears show what Tribe he was - the Wolfman Tribe. Indeed, he was a
                                            Wolfman, and along his head fur, there was a mix of gold, clearly showing
                                            his noble status.</p>
                                        <p>Similarly, the one on his back was also a Wolfman, even stouter and more
                                            muscular than himself, though his features held some similarities to this
                                            old Wolfman. However, he was currently ashen and with an ugly expression on
                                            his face. His eyes were closed, his entire body shuddering violently
                                            uncontrollably. Yet, it was somehow clear that this shivering was not due to
                                            the cold, as his face constantly flickered with three different colours…
                                            black, grey and blue.</p>
                                        <p>This Wolfman was none other than the Regiment Commander of the Swift Wolf
                                            Regiment, the heir to the Wolfman Tribe, Prince of the Wolves, Butler. And
                                            the old Wolfman carrying him up was none other than the current Wolfman
                                            Tribe Leader, Batulu.</p>
                                        <p>That day, when the Swift Wolf Regiment had received their first utter defeat
                                            and returned, Butler had not even had the time for regrets and heartache
                                            from it. That was because he had to deal with his own current physical
                                            condition.</p>
                                        <p>When he had first been struck with Zhou Weiqing’s Dark Demon God Lightning,
                                            Butler had not thought much about it. Although he could sense that this
                                            energy was extremely strange, it was after all from a mere four-Jeweled
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master. No matter how strong his attack was, Butler believed
                                            that it was only a four-Jeweled offense, and with his own Heavenly Energy,
                                            at most it would take a large expense of energy to deal with and to force it
                                            out.</p>
                                        <p>As such, when he returned to his tent, Butler had quickly started to force
                                            out the venom with his Heavenly Energy.</p>
                                        <p>Very soon, Butler realised that something was wrong… his Heavenly Energy was
                                            unable to influence the venom at all. His cultivation level was extremely
                                            powerful, and his Nine-Jeweled Heavenly Energy was able to greatly slow the
                                            advance of the Tri-Attribute Venom of the Dark Demon God Lightning. Alas,
                                            slowing was one matter… but he was unable to get rid of it!</p>
                                        <p>Butler had been shocked to find that as time passed, although the venom did
                                            not move faster, it continued slowly eating away at his body, a slow but
                                            unstoppable juggernaut of invasion. Even his Heavenly Energy was slowly
                                            being eroded by this strange venom, and no matter what he tried, he was
                                            unable to force it out of his body. This was extremely shocking; after all,
                                            he was not only a Wolfman, but also with Royal Blood, and his physique was
                                            much tougher and stronger than any human. Despite all that, he was slowly
                                            falling under the power of the Tri-Attribute Venom.</p>
                                        <p>When his subordinates found that Butler was unable to make it, they did not
                                            dare delay, hurriedly sending him back to the Wolfman Tribe. The Wolf King
                                            had no time to blame his son for the loss, and he sent all around for the
                                            best doctors in his tribe to come and heal Butler. Alas, was the Dark Demon
                                            God Lightning so easily removed?</p>
                                        <p>The Wolf King Batulu had many children, but of them all, only his eldest son
                                            was the most promising, the most talented and outstanding one. He was
                                            already old, and he had planned to pass the mantle of Wolf King to his son
                                            after another few years. Who knew such a thing would happen at this point.
                                            He no longer had the time to lament over the great loss of the Swift Wolf
                                            Regiment, and could only hope that his son could recover.</p>
                                        <p>For this matter, Batulu did not even care about his old face, going to some
                                            of the stronger Beastmen tribes of the WanShou Empire to beg for help, even
                                            to the noble tribes. Alas, even as they examined Butler’s body, the only
                                            answer Batulu got was a shaking head. No one was able to remove this strange
                                            fusion Tri-Attribute Venom.</p>
                                        <p>Batulu could not afford to lose this son, his chosen heir. After an entire
                                            month of seeking help, Butler’s body was getting worse every day, his
                                            Heavenly Energy also weakening constantly, and more so, it was visible that
                                            his Life Force was slowly draining from him. At last, after begging the
                                            WanShou Empire Royal Family, he was given the chance to seek help in the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
                                        <p>In the eyes of the Beastmen, the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord was
                                            their greatest leader, all powerful, almighty, even omnipotent. For this
                                            eldest son of his, Batulu would risk everything to come to beg for help,
                                            even if it might draw the ire of their greatest leader.</p>
                                        <p>Batulu’s cultivation level was actually the same as his eldest son, Butler,
                                            at the nine-Jeweled stage. He had been stuck at this stage for a long time,
                                            never managing to break through to the Heavenly King Stage.</p>
                                        <p>The weather at the Heavenly Snow Mountain was just too cold, and as they
                                            ascended the slopes, the lower the temperature grew. This was a major
                                            contrast from the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens right below with its warm and
                                            welcoming temperature. The highest peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain was
                                            about six thousand metres, even higher than the Heavenly Jewel Island.
                                            Although Batulu was a powerful Heavenly Jewel Master, but carrying his son
                                            on his back while having to constantly use his Heavenly Energy to protect
                                            his son and keep him alive, it was getting tougher and tougher for me to
                                            climb up.</p>
                                        <p>“Halt.”” A low, magnetic sounding voice rang out abruptly. The voice was not
                                            loud, but it seemed to explode in Batulu’s ears like a bomb.</p>
                                        <p>Batulu looked up quickly in shock, only the realise that not far ahead from
                                            him, there stood a man, though he did not know when that man had
                                            appeared.</p>
                                        <p>Dressed in snow white robes, with a closer look he seemed to only be wearing
                                            those, a single layer of clothing. A head full of fiery red, gold hair with
                                            natural curls, a stark contrast from the cold white world around him. He was
                                            tall and slender, seeming to be not particularly muscular, but as he stood
                                            there, it gave the feeling as if he was the core of the universe.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at the luscious head of long gold-red hair [1. The paragraph before
                                            this, he says 'short hair', and this paragraph is 'long hair'. Seeing as
                                            it's supposed to depict the mane of a lion, I think I'll pick long hair as
                                            canon] that seemed to twirl around against the backdrop of snow like the
                                            dancing of flames, Batulu’s body began to shiver. Such a hair colour… in the
                                            entire WanShou Empire, only one Tribe had that. It was the current Royal
                                            Lion Tribe, the ruler of the WanShou Empire, the Heavenly Divine Earth
                                            Spirit Lion Tribe!</p>
                                        <p>In the WanShou Empire, there was a rule passed down from the beginning - the
                                            Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain could only be from two Tribes.
                                            One was naturally the current Lord’s Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger Tribe, and
                                            the other was Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion Tribe. However, since the
                                            Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger Tribe had been so powerful for so many
                                            generations, many had already forgotten that the Heavenly Divine Earth
                                            Spirit Lion Tribe could also inherit the position of Mountain Lord. They,
                                            too, had highly noble bloodlines amongst all the Beastmen. As tradition
                                            went, when the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger Tribe held the position of
                                            Mountain Lord, then the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion Tribe would hold
                                            the position of ruler of the WanShou Empire; and vice versa.</p>
                                        <p>Without even asking, Batulu was able to guess the status of this young man in
                                            front of him. With his own cultivation level, a person of that age who could
                                            remain undetected by himself in the entire Divine Spirit Flame Lion Tribe of
                                            the Heavenly Snow Mountain could only be one person.</p>
                                        <p>“You, you are the Lion Prince, Your Highness right? This old wolf Batulu
                                            greets His Highness.” As he said that, Batulu bowed respectfully towards
                                            him, helping his son down from his back.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing the words Batulu, the Lion Price’s face eased up. “So it is you, the
                                            Wolf King. My Father has already sent word to me previously about your
                                            situation, and I have come here to wait for you.” Naturally, with his rank
                                            and status in the Heavenly Snow Mountain, he would not come to the middle of
                                            the mountain side for no reason.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing those words, Batulu was immediately filled with gratitude, tears
                                            sliding down his cheeks. The Beastmen were normally all very straightforward
                                            in character, and seeing how the Lion Prince, the future ruler of the
                                            Empire, would actually wait for the two of them here in the cold windy
                                            mountain side, although Batulu knew that he was trying to draw them to his
                                            side, it did not stop him from feeling gratitude.</p>
