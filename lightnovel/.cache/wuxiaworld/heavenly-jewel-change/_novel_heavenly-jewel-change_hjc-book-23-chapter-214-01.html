                                            should be his defense, and his speed would not be too good. As such, he was
                                            confident in using his own speed and agility in taking the fight to Ma Qun,
                                            and he still had a chance of winning. After all, for Ma Qun to wear such an
                                            armour, it should mean his Heavenly Energy cultivation level wasn’t too
                                            high.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Qian Shu attacked, Ma Qun did not choose to dodge. Instead, he waved
                                            his arms, withdrawing his weapons. At the same time, he stepped towards Qian
                                            Shu’s direction, his arms twirling the massive spiked maces in direct swipes
                                            towards Qian Shu.</p>
                                        <p>If not for his insane armour, such an attack from Ma Qun would normally be
                                            deemed as a suicide-attack type move, pitting their lives against each
                                            other. After all, Qian Shu had attacked first, and though his weapons might
                                            not be as large Ma Qun’s he would definitely hit first.</p>
                                        <p>However, with the Peerless Regiment Heavy Cavalry Armour, everything
                                            changed.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the two terrifying massive spiked maces, Qian Shu couldn’t help but
                                            shiver in his heart. He dared not care about hurting his opponent, instead
                                            lowering his body down, striking the ground with his feet in a swift
                                            movement to dodge the spiked maces, before his ice blades struck out again
                                            towards Ma Qun’s legs.</p>
                                        <p>Qian Shu’s reactions could be considered very fast. Alas, it did not change
                                            the fact that Ma Qun was not even looking at his actions, only enacting his
                                            own plans and actions.</p>
                                        <p>The two large spiked maces swung in a sweeping motion, not changing its path
                                            because of his enemy’s dodge. With his legs as a pivot, he just spun himself
                                            totally, one spiked mace swerving upwards, the other swerving downwards.
                                            With his body moving, he was like a meat grinder smashing towards Qian Shu’s
                                            direction.</p>
                                        <p>*Puu**Puu* Qian Shu’s ice blades smashed hard into Ma Qun’s leg. However, his
                                            attacks merely left two faint scratches on the Frozen Steel Armour, and
                                            instead the ice blades showed signs of cracking on impact. At the same time,
                                            the large spiked maces had already spun an entire round and returned.</p>
                                        <p>The length of the spiked maces were almost two metres, along with their
                                            thickness and Ma Qun’s spinning, the area of effect of their reach was just
                                            too large. Even though Qian Shu was an Agility type Heavenly Jewel Master,
                                            being overextended in position from his attack, he was unable to dodge it a
                                            second time.</p>
                                        <p>Lifting his arms, he put his ice blades in a parrying position as his right
                                            foot stomped on the ground, using the momentum to push his body to the
                                            ground, his back on the stage floor as he tried to slide away.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, on the first spin, Ma Qun had already noticed that Qian Shu had gone
                                            down low, and the lower mace of his reached all the way to the ground.</p>
                                        <p>*BANG*</p>
                                        <p>The massive spiked mace smashed savagely onto the crossguard of Qian Shu’s
                                            ice blades, and a terrifying sight occurred. Qian Shu felt an
                                            incomprehensible strength transferring to him, and both ice blades in his
                                            hands shattered instantly. The next instant, the spiked mace smashed into
                                            the Consolidated Equipment of his arms. His entire body, Consolidated
                                            Equipment and all, was sent flying out of the stage like a golf ball,
                                            careening across the stage floor.</p>
                                        <p>In midair, Qian Shu’s Consolidated Equipment around his arms also shattered.
                                            Luckily, it was because of the protection of the pair of Consolidated
                                            Equipment that saved his arms, escaping with minor injuries instead of being
                                            broken straight away.</p>
                                        <p>With just the single strike from Ma Qun, it sent Qian Shu flying more than
                                            thirty metres before falling to the ground, almost reaching the rest
                                            houses.</p>
                                        <p>Although Qian Shu was not heavily injured, he had already been knocked off
                                            the stage, and the victory had been determined.</p>
                                        <p>“This… does this also work?” Such a sentence occurred throughout all the rest
                                            houses.</p>
                                        <p>All of them had discerning eyes, and they could naturally tell that this was
                                            not even considered a clash between Heavenly Jewel Masters… more like a
                                            clash between a Heavenly Jewel Master and raw physical strength. Ma Qun did
                                            not even summon his Heavenly Jewels or use his Heavenly Energy, let alone
                                            any Stored Skills or Consolidated Equipment. He had just used raw
                                            unadulterated physical strength to send Qian Shu flying out of the stage.
                                            That was a four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master! Yet, he had lost the fight
                                            without even much resistance… in such a short period of time!</p>
                                        <p>On the VIP Stand, the ZhongTian Emperor Shangguan Tianxin had a slightly
                                            stunned look on his face, and he was muttering to himself: “So this is the
                                            notorious Peerless Regiment Heavy Cavalry? No wonder, no wonder. It looks
                                            like the news from the west is indeed accurate. If that brat Zhou Weiqing
                                            actually led several hundred of these powerful warriors, it is definitely
                                            possible to repulse the Kalise army.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianxin had long since read the report about the bloody battle in
                                            the Crescent City. His news was from Shangguan Xue’er, and thus was rather
                                            detailed. However, at that time, when Shangguan Tianxin heard her say that
                                            Zhou Weiqing had only used three thousand fresh recruits and seven hundred
                                            Peerless Regiment soldiers to withstand the crazed onslaught of fifty
                                            thousand Kalise soldiers, he had only smiled passively. In his eyes, perhaps
                                            Xue’er had overestimated the numbers of the Kalise armies. However, now that
                                            he had seen Ma Qun’s terrifying display of power, he immediately readjusted
                                            his thinking about Zhou Weiqing’s Peerless Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>After proclaiming the result of this fight and for the next match to begin,
                                            Shangguan Longyin walked beside Shangguan Tianxin.</p>
                                        <p>“Your Majesty.”</p>
                                        <p>“En. What do you think?” Shangguan Tianxin asked Shangguan Longyin.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin was silently for a moment before saying: “These Peerless
                                            Heavy Cavalry should not be from the Ruffian Battalions. According to the
                                            news from the Northwest Army Camp, it seems like Zhou Weiqing had taken in
                                            some warrior tribes; the entirety of their tribes, and incorporated their
                                            warriors as part of his forces. These Tribes have some impressive natural
                                            inborn talents indeed. If I did not see wrongly, just now that Peerless
                                            Regiment Heavy Cavalry warrior’s armour was no less than a thousand jin
                                            heavy, but it did not influence his movement at all. Any ordinary warrior,
                                            even for a Heavenly Jewel Master, he would not be able to wear it. From that
                                            alone, we can see that this person’s physical strength alone is already at a
                                            terrifying stage. At this point, I can truly understand how is it that the
                                            WanShou Empire forces had lost so much to the Peerless Regiment. That little
                                            rascal Zhou Weiqing is definitely no ordinary person.”</p>
                                        <p>As they were speaking up above, on the stage, Ma Qun was howling smugly,
                                            raising his massive spiked maces in the air, as if he was some invincible
                                            general who had defeated an enemy army.</p>
                                        <p>“Hey, it’s time for you to go down. We are about to start the next match.” It
                                            was only after the judge’s reminder that Ma Qun realised he had to leave the
                                            stage, and he walked off the stage with some discontent, as if he still
                                            wasn’t satisfied.</p>
                                        <p>The members of the Battle Teams with the four Great Saint Lands as background
                                            all revealed disdainful looks. Their judgement of Ma Qun was the mere words:
                                            Simple minded, mere brute force.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, Zhou Weiqing did not hear their appraisal, otherwise he would have
                                            fallen to the ground laughing. For someone to deem Ma Qun, a fellow who had
                                            dared to try trick him when they first entered the Fei Li Royal Family
                                            Military Academy, as simple minded? Perhaps in the entire Berserker Tribe
                                            with their Titan Bloodline, no one else was as cunning and sneaky as this
                                            fellow. En… even as he judged Ma Qun as cunning, the sneakiest Zhou Weiqing
                                            did not blush or blink at all.</p>
                                        <p>The other Mi Ou Battle Team members had extremely ugly expressions. When Qian
                                            Shu returned to his team rest house, he felt like he couldn’t lift up his
                                            head. To lose to a brute like that who only used physical strength, his
                                            heart was extremely gloomy and unreconciled. In his eyes, he should have the
                                            chance to defeat Ma Qun, but he had underestimated that heavy armour of
                                            his.</p>
                                        <p>The second member of the Mi Ou Battle Team quickly ascended the stage. Since
                                            the first match was a loss, this time their team leader decided to take the
                                            fight personally.</p>
                                        <p>As compared to the previous Heavenly Jewel Tournament, this year’s Mi Ou
                                            Battle Team seemed to be weaker overall. Even this team leader was only at
                                            the five-Jeweled stage. It could be said that the Mi Ou Battle Team was the
                                            complete reverse of almost all other battle teams, who were far stronger
                                            than all their previous incarnations. To be more accurate, they were just
                                            here to ‘buy soy sauce’[1. Literal translation - internet slang for ‘just
                                            passing by’]. However, even if they didn’t have high aspirations, they did
                                            not want to lose in too ugly a fashion, especially against a team like the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire’s who were only participating for the first time. In
                                            their eyes, this was something that was unacceptable.</p>
                                        <p>As the Mi Ou Battle Team leader ascended the stage, Ma Qun was just walking
                                            down. Just as he was prepared to look at what kind of opponent the Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire would send for him, another massive figure jumped up.</p>
                                        <p>*BOOM* *CRASH*</p>
                                        <p>A horrendous crashing sound rang through all the rest houses, even giving the
                                            VIP Stand a huge scare. Both the Mi Ou Battle Team Leader and the judge on
                                            the stage were sent staggering back with the sheer sound shockwave and
                                            reverberations of the stage. If not for the fact that their cultivation
                                            levels were not low, perhaps they might have even fallen down.</p>
                                        <p>The Mi Ou Battle Team leader’s mouth couldn’t help but twitch uncontrollably.
                                            One moving steel fortress had just gone down, and another one had sprang up.
                                            Looking at the height and stature, it did not pale compared to the previous
                                            one. Even their armour was exactly the same, with the only difference being
                                            the weapons in their hands.</p>
                                        <p>It couldn’t be that fellow who went down had just changed weapons and jumped
                                            back up right? Otherwise, how could the Heavenly Bow Empire have so many
                                            insanely strong fellows like that?</p>
                                        <p>The judge had been given a rather large scare, and his heart was still
                                            thumping wildly. Mouth twitching, he said: “Both sides, introduction.”</p>
                                        <p>“Mi Ou Empire. Zhao Hui.” After reporting his name, the team leader stared
                                            savagely at his opponent, concentrating fully on his opponent’s voice. If it
                                            was exactly the same, he would definitely voice out his suspicions to the
                                            judge, asking the opponent to remove his helmet.</p>
                                        <p>“Heavenly Bow Empire. Xixi.”</p>
                                        <p>As soon as the voice rang out, even the judge started slightly. A warrior
                                            with such a massive physical stature… he.. Was a she…? Furthermore, Xixi’s
                                            voice was a stark contrast from her figure… such a silky sweet voice, it was
                                            definitely not something that a man could imitate no matter how he tried,
                                            sounding extremely comforting.</p>
                                        <p>This… this was really a girl? Zhao Hui was extremely gloomy. The judge was
                                            still in shock, but he quickly proclaimed the start of the match to prevent
                                            himself from suffering any further shocks.</p>
                                        <p>Below the stage, in the Heavenly Bow Battle Team rest house, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            observing the fight very closely. Amongst all his team mates, the one he was
                                            least familiar with was Xixi, and he had not seen her fight before. As such,
                                            he had dispatched her to fight in this first round of battles. After all, he
                                            needed to familiarize himself with his team member’s capabilities so that he
                                            could better arrange their strategy in the later stages of the
                                            tournament.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun smiled faintly and said: “Boss, do not worry. In terms of defense,
                                            Xixi is definitely no match for Ma Qun. However, if we speak of offensive
                                            strength, even two Ma Qun’s cannot compare to her. In the Crescent City
                                            battle, Xixi was at the west gates, so you did not see her fighting. There,
                                            she killed more than five hundred enemies by herself. She earned herself the
                                            nickname Gentle Fiend Goddess. Normally, she is extremely gentle, but once
                                            she enters battle mode, her ferocity scares even myself.”</p>
