                                            be for original citizens of the Crescent City, and the merchant traffic that
                                            comes in and out constantly should still be taxed. These traders are all
                                            extremely rich; if we do not shave some off of them, then it would be a
                                            major disadvantage, even a disservice, to ourselves.”</p>
                                        <p>“Weiqing, have a look there. To our east and west flanks, there lies a city
                                            each not far from us. The distance from those two cities to our Crescent
                                            City is about a hundred and fifty li to two hundred li, and their sizes are
                                            actually not too different from the Crescent City. Within the area
                                            controlled by these three cities, there are a total of two hundred and sixty
                                            three villages, and the overall population of the cities and villages added
                                            together is actually shockingly high if we add them all up. This has a
                                            historical reason, after all this is close to the Fei Li Empire borders, and
                                            the safety and prosperity of the Fei Li Empire is naturally more attractive;
                                            thus almost two thirds of the original Heavenly Bow Empire citizens are
                                            actually at the north. As long as we take control of those two cities, not
                                            only will we be able to greatly increase our income and resources, we can
                                            also gain much influence. More importantly, we will have the manpower to
                                            begin proper recruitment. We can also seize the chance to spread the word
                                            about our great victory over the Kalise Empire, and hopefully draw the
                                            attention of the Heavenly Bow Empire army whose remnants are scattered all
                                            over the lands.”</p>
                                        <p>By occupying all three cities, that means we will form a line of control that
                                            is easy to guard, and it also means we will truly have our backs to the Fei
                                            Li Empire. If the Kalise Empire chooses to defend and are not urgent about
                                            attacking us, it is even better for us. For now, gathering our strength is
                                            the most important. With the full might of the Peerless Regiment as our ace,
                                            when the time comes, even if the enemies send two Legions, we do not need to
                                            be afraid. Furthermore, if the Bai Da Empire really sends a major troop
                                            against us, that will give us the perfect opportunity to request for aid
                                            from the Fei Li Empire. They will not condone having such a huge army from
                                            their enemies so near their borders, and by fighting in our lands with us as
                                            a barrier, it is far more attractive than having the Bai Da Empire invade
                                            them instead… so they will most likely agree. Once our army strength is
                                            sufficient and with proper training, it will be easier to do anything we
                                            plan from there.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Bro Ming, your thoughts truly
                                            coincide naturally with mine, we are indeed perfectly in harmony. Taking the
                                            north of our original Heavenly Bow Empire territory, recruitment, stocking
                                            up of supplies… growing our strength to wait for a good opportunity. Very
                                            good, now I can feel easy in passing you the direct command of my army.”</p>
                                        <p>“The greatest benefit of a lateral expansion like that is that it will be
                                            less likely to cross the baseline tolerance of the enemy. We can stay silent
                                            and unmoving while building up, and once we act, it has to be a swift and
                                            crushing movement that has great effect, so slice through our enemies like
                                            splitting bamboo[1. Literal translation - basically similar to our ‘knife
                                            through hot butter’]. Not only do I want to revive our Heavenly Bow Empire,
                                            but I also want to wipe out the Kalise Empire from the map. They have given
                                            us such pain and suffering, and I will definitely return it ten times, a
                                            hundred times!”</p>
                                        <p>As he spoke up to that point, Zhou Weiqing’s fists were gripped tightly, a
                                            cold light in his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had a relatively simple style of judgement towards things. He
                                            believed in the old saying ‘Words are but wind , but seeing is believing’.
                                            In the Fei Li Empire, although Ming Yu and his personal guards had lost to
                                            his Peerless Regiment, Ming Yu had also shown him his strength and skill in
                                            commanding his troops.</p>
                                        <p>In that respect, Zhou Weiqing held great respect for Ming Yu. He had been
                                            able to command and wield his thousand men as if they were part of his body,
                                            an extension of his will. Such an ability, it was not something any ordinary
                                            commander could do.</p>
                                        <p>It was also due to this respect for Ming Yu that he actually felt a stronger
                                            good will towards the Heavenly Demon Sect. One of Zhou Weiqing’s strongest
                                            points was that he had a good judge on his own abilities, knowing where his
                                            own strength and weaknesses lay.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of pure fighting and combat prowess, even five of Ming Yu added
                                            together was no match for Zhou Weiqing. But… in terms of commanding an army,
                                            perhaps ten Zhou Weiqings could barely catch up with the Fei Li God
                                            General!</p>
                                        <p>As such, although Ming Yu had just joined them, Zhou Weiqing instantly
                                            declared his absolute trust in him. Zhou Weiqing was extremely clear that
                                            the type of human being Ming Yu was… they were often proud and aloof. If he
                                            presented himself as wary and on guard against him, perhaps this Fei Li God
                                            General would leave… after all the Fei Li Empire was a good example.</p>
                                        <p>What Zhou Weiqing wanted was to allow Ming Yu to use all his talents to their
                                            maximum. He could understand why Ming Yu had come… the Heavenly Demon Sect
                                            aside, perhaps it was more that he truly wanted to have a chance to command
                                            the Peerless Regiment of his.</p>
                                        <p>For someone like Ming Yu, even though his cultivation level was not higher,
                                            but his rank and status in the Heavenly Demon Sect was perhaps even higher
                                            than his father Ming Wu. If he was not willing to do so, even the Heavenly
                                            Demon Sect would not be able to force him to go aid Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Regiment had been built from ground up by Zhou Weiqing, after so
                                            many trials and tribulations. He knew how much effort and resources he had
                                            poured in the Peerless Regiment. Even if one ignored the massive amounts of
                                            gold and resources, just in terms of the spirit, vigor and thought he had
                                            invested, without Shangguan Fei’er and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s
                                            precious medicines, without Long Shiya’s Heavenly Cores to create those
                                            medicines, and without so many skilled Consolidating Equipment Masters
                                            painstakingly creating so many Consolidating Equipment Scrolls… how could
                                            the Peerless Regiment be at its current state? Even now, the entire Peerless
                                            Regiment had not been fully outfitted. To have lost forty nine of his elite
                                            warriors and brothers, Zhou Weiqing’s heart truly ached deeply.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, it wasn’t that Zhou Weiqing’s heart did not ache when he passed
                                            the command of his precious Peerless Regiment to Ming Yu. However, he was
                                            clear that only an outstanding commander like Ming Yu could truly make full
                                            use of the Peerless Regiments entirety, to flourish their true power and
                                            strength. He did not want to see another time like the fight in the Crescent
                                            City. Despite the fact that they had achieved final victory, and Ming Yu did
                                            not speak of anything, but Zhou Weiqing knew that their losses were because
                                            of his own mistakes in command. If he had been able to hold back longer,
                                            waiting a month before he actually attacked the Crescent City, they would
                                            never have suffered such losses. He might have the talent at military
                                            command, but it was definitely extremely undeveloped and immature. Zhou
                                            Weiqing did not want to see the force he had painstakingly built up wasted
                                            away due to his own commands.</p>
                                        <p>It was because of all these factors and considerations that he did not
                                            hesitate to pass command to Ming Yu, while he remained at the background
                                            overseeing everything. Of course, that did not mean that his existence was
                                            useless. On the contrary, just like what Ming Yu had said, he was the
                                            spiritual leader of the Peerless Regiment, the soul and backbone of the
                                            entire Regiment. It would not be easy for Ming Yu to even attempt to take
                                            over his position. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing would still be the decider in
                                            matters of the big picture. In terms of direct military command, perhaps
                                            Zhou Weiqing was still lacking, but in terms of big picture strategy and the
                                            entire political structural layout of the world, he was no lesser than Ming
                                            Yu. Perhaps in terms of level, he was at an even higher state than Ming
                                            Yu.</p>
                                        <p>Only Zhou Weiqing himself knew clearly what connection he had with the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain, and how to make use of
                                            that connection.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, the Peerless Regiment was created by Zhou Weiqing and his
                                            companions. Even if Ming Yu had the command of the Regiment, he did not need
                                            to worry. After all, no matter what, Ming Yu would never be able to take
                                            away the Peerless Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>This bloody battle in the Crescent City could be said to have taught Zhou
                                            Weiqing a massive, painful lesson, but it was valuable experience
                                            nonetheless. Towards any future battles and wars, Zhou Weiqing was beginning
                                            to have a clearer picture and understanding.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu laughed heartily and said: “Very good, I shall not be too courteous
                                            then. I hope that you are truly letting me have full command, and absolute
                                            control in that sense.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Your every order is to be executed without
                                            fail. If anyone disobeys, they will be punished with martial law.”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu said: “Very good. Next, what we shall do first is to build up our
                                            campaign. Our losses this time are extremely high, and the citizens in the
                                            Crescent City will not be able to recover from the pain so quickly. As such,
                                            recruiting should not be our top priority any time soon. After all, our
                                            Peerless Regiment main force should be arriving soon. Of course, my dear
                                            Commander Zhou, I have to say that if the rest of your Peerless Regiment are
                                            just flowers in a mirror and the moon's reflection in water [2. Literal
                                            translation of idiom. Basically means a beautiful dream/illusion], and not
                                            as you promised, don’t blame me if I just walk away! As a commander and
                                            general, it is your Peerless Regiment that drew me here, and I would be
                                            extremely honoured to be able to command an elite regiment like that.
                                            Otherwise, I might as well remain in the Fei Li Empire and continue scheming
                                            along with them.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “You will definitely be satisfied.
                                            Without question, this First Main Company that I have brought are the finest
                                            of the entire Peerless Regiment, the cream of the crop. However, the rest of
                                            the troops are not to be dismissed easily. Especially so for the Peerless
                                            Heavy Cavalry… they definitely have equivalent strength, or perhaps even
                                            stronger.”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu nodded and said: “Let the Peerless Regiment brothers rest and heal
                                            up. I will send my personal guard out to begin spreading news and
                                            propaganda, to let the brilliant results we have achieved spread through the
                                            north. We must let the citizens in the north know that our Heavenly Bow
                                            Empire armies have returned. Next, we just need to continue moving step by
                                            step and it should be without any problems. After all, the most difficult
                                            and important fight is now over.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing began to introduce Ming Yu to the various structure and
                                            formations of the Peerless Regiment in detail, their powers and strengths.
                                            After which, this Commander once again passed the reins of power totally to
                                            Ming Yu. By leaving halfway, firstly it was to show full support for Ming
                                            Yu, and secondly was also because his heart was now with Tian’er and his
                                            precious one in her stomach.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>After a few days of sorrow, the Crescent City slowly regained a sense of
                                            normalcy. The four gates opened wide, and normal operations resumed bit by
                                            bit.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Yu was definitely the sort who carried out his tasks with speed and
                                            vigor, with the force of thunder and speed of lightning. Within these few
                                            days, he had already familiarized himself with all of the Peerless Regiment,
                                            all the various formations within and their strengths and weaknesses. After
                                            some discussion with Zhou Weiqing, he had also added his personal guard to
                                            the Peerless Regiment, splitting them into two ‘Main Companies’ to suit the
                                            Peerless Regiment’s formations. As such, the total strength of the Peerless
                                            Regiment was actually now that of an actual Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>Unexpectedly, in just four days, the main force of the Peerless Regiment had
                                            passed through the Fei Li Empire borders and reached the Crescent City. When
                                            Zhou Weiqing caught sight of the familiar sight of his closest armies
                                            arriving, tears almost threatened to fall! The arrival of the Peerless
                                            Regiment meant that they could finally hold steady in the north of the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire, no longer needing to worry about enemy attacks.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, the entire Heavenly Bow Empire armies were fully ready to begin
                                            the revival of their empire, their various departments deployed out,
                                            especially in terms of their proper formations.</p>
