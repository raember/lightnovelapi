                                            Image must be a fake, how could a four-Jeweled Master have a Skill that only
                                            a Heavenly God Tier Master could have? As for his gold war wolf mount’s
                                            shivering, he rationalized it by attributing it to Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic
                                            Change State aura. The only puzzling thing to him now was that… could it be
                                            the Heavenly Demon Sect had started cooperating with the ZhongTian Empire?
                                            Even if that was so, the Five Great Saint Lands were not supposed to join in
                                            ordinary wars. That was breaking the agreement between the Great Saint
                                            Lands!</p>
                                        <p>All these thoughts flashed in Butler’s heart in that instant, and Zhou
                                            Weiqing had already arrived before him, not allowing him anymore time to
                                            think deeper and further on that. With a cruel light in his eyes, he swung
                                            the massive spiked club in his hands in a wide sweep. At the same time, he
                                            invoked a Bloodthirst Skill, causing his already immense strength to grow
                                            further.</p>
                                        <p>For Butler, being chosen to be honoured to ascend the Heavenly Snow Mountain
                                            was not just some dumb luck, nor was it only because he was the heir to the
                                            wolfman tribe. Furthermore, his Elemental Jewel was of the Darkness
                                            Attribute. Although the WanShou Empire had a severe disadvantage in terms of
                                            Consolidated Equipment, they had a rich natural advantage in terms of
                                            Storing Skill. With the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, the highest echelons of
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters of the WanShou Empire would not lack good Skills to
                                            Store.</p>
                                        <p>Once again, another enemy had underestimated Zhou Weiqing. On seeing the mere
                                            four Heavenly Jewels, Butler only chose to use his first Jewel’s Elemental
                                            Skill, one that he had Stored so many years ago, the Bloodthirst Skill. Of
                                            course, though it was a lower ranked one, it had also grown with him to the
                                            nine-Jeweled stage, instantly giving him a burst of strength and killing
                                            intent. Seeing Zhou Weiqing’s leg careening down, in Butler’s eyes, if Zhou
                                            Weiqing did not have any Skill or change in direction, that leg would
                                            undoubtedly be instantly destroyed by his spiked club. Furthermore, he had
                                            prepared another Skill to use in case Zhou Weiqing had a backup plan once
                                            their strikes met, then his powerful Darkness Skill would be unleashed
                                            unhesitatingly to give Zhou Weiqing a massive blow. He wanted to kill this
                                            little brat as quickly as possible before charging into the enemy ranks to
                                            slaughter them and take revenge for his fallen tribesmen.</p>
                                        <p>Butler’s calculations were not bad, and his judgement was not wrong as well.
                                            Zhou Weiqing did indeed have a backup plan. Alas for Butler, that backup
                                            plan was far beyond his expectations.</p>
                                        <p>A purple red vortex appeared stealthily over Butler’s head before anyone knew
                                            what had happened. When the purple red light stained his entire body, it was
                                            also at the instant that his large spiked mace was about to impact with Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s right leg.</p>
                                        <p>In the next moment, Butler was totally stunned. To his shock, his spiked mace
                                            disappeared before his eyes. It was not just his spiked mace, as all his
                                            Consolidated Equipment did so as well, and along with that was the powerful
                                            Skill that he had prepared. In that instant, he seemed to have lost his link
                                            with them.</p>
                                        <p>No matter how powerful a Heavenly Jewel Master was, to meet with something so
                                            inexplicable so suddenly, one would definitely be affected in some way, and
                                            a momentary pause of shock was unavoidable. This was all part of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s plan and expectations, and his right leg continued downward
                                            without pause, without any holding back.</p>
                                        <p>Butler was truly a seasoned warrior who had been through many battles, and
                                            after a split second of being stunned, he recovered swiftly, realising
                                            something was off. At this time, it was too late for him to do anything
                                            else, and almost totally subconsciously, his arms lifted upwards in a block.
                                            He had lost his Consolidated Equipment and access to Stored Skills, but he
                                            could still use his powerful Heavenly Energy, and it burst forth
                                            immediately, covering his arms in white as they crossed in a lock to block
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s right leg.</p>
                                        <p>Another loud explosion, and Zhou Weiqing was sent flying back, while Butler’s
                                            entire body shook violently. He could feel the bones of both his arms
                                            creaking with the sheer impact. Although his powerful Heavenly Energy had
                                            protected his arms from being broken by that downward kick from Zhou
                                            Weiqing, the terrifyingly powerful impact from the Demonic Right Leg, in his
                                            Demonic Change State, still caused both his arms to hurt. Furthermore, that
                                            power had been sent right through him all the way down to the gold war wolf
                                            below him, and its legs buckled and it crashed to the ground.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since Zhou Weiqing had charged forward, that gold war wolf had lost its
                                            awe inspiring dignity and valiant look. It dared not even attack Zhou
                                            Weiqing; after all, it had only just reached the Zong Stage, and the aura
                                            around Zhou Weiqing could affect even a powerful Heavenly Beast like the
                                            Silver Emperor, let alone itself. The poor gold war wolf could not even
                                            bring forth thirty percent of its usual power.</p>
                                        <p>Just as Butler was reeling in shock from the blow, as well as why his
                                            Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills were blocked off from him, he
                                            suddenly felt a strange sensation on his arms. At that point, his Heavenly
                                            Energy protective aura had almost been shattered by Zhou Weiqing’s kick, and
                                            as soon as that strange sensation appeared, he quickly looked down.</p>
                                        <p>A tiny little pearl, glowing blue, black and grey in a strange swirl, was now
                                            stuck on his arm. When he looked at it, he could clearly see that the last
                                            dredges of his Heavenly Energy protective aura was eaten away by that
                                            strange pearl, opening a small hole in it, and the pearl wormed its way
                                            in.</p>
                                        <p>Butler was not Han Tianyou after all, and furthermore he did not have any
                                            knowledge of the true power of the Dark Demon God Lightning, nor had he
                                            experienced it for himself yet. As such, he naturally would not cut off his
                                            arms to cut his losses just like that. Another violent explosion shook the
                                            entire battlefield, and even the wolf cavalry soldiers on the other side of
                                            the fire wall could clearly see the strange tri-coloured glow that rose all
                                            around Butler.</p>
                                        <p>Butler was sent flying back from his gold war wolf by the abrupt explosion
                                            from the Dark Demon God Lightning. However, the explosion did not bring him
                                            any additional pain, instead a bone chilling cold.</p>
                                        <p>The Dark Demon God Lightning was the most overbearing Yin-type Lightning, and
                                            the power generated after its explosion would only invade the enemy’s body
                                            and innards. If it were any ordinary person, or someone with lower
                                            cultivation than Zhou Weiqing, the process of the explosion and the invasion
                                            would be enough to cause the person to melt into sludge.</p>
                                        <p>However, it was unlikely that Zhou Weiqing would use this overbearing Skill
                                            against anyone weaker. Butler was after all a Nine-Jeweled powerhouse, and
                                            his meridian passageways had all been refined by over thirty levels of
                                            Heavenly Energy, and he was much tougher and stronger than any ordinary
                                            person. As a result, the Tri-Attribute Venom from the Dark Demon God
                                            Lightning could only enter his body slowly, attempting to circulate
                                            around.</p>
                                        <p>A cold shiver ran over Butler’s body, and he truly started to feel fear.
                                            Without hesitation, he punched out towards Zhou Weiqing, the thick Heavenly
                                            Energy causing the air to compress and explode outwards. Although Zhou
                                            Weiqing was at a distance of over twenty yards due to both of them being
                                            sent flying back, he could still feel the powerful backlash from that
                                            blow.</p>
                                        <p>The gap between the Heavenly Energy and power levels of two were just too
                                            huge. Perhaps if Zhou Weiqing unleashed his Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms and
                                            used their Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura, he could barely
                                            block the blow. However, would he really do such a thing? As the disciple of
                                            the God Eye Scoundrel, he would not do something so foolish like that.</p>
                                        <p>In a flash of silver, Zhou Weiqing appeared ten yards to the side, and the
                                            fist of power from Butler naturally missed him. When Butler wanted to attack
                                            once more, the cold within his body abruptly flared up, growing stronger,
                                            and he did not dare continue attacking.</p>
                                        <p>He could not possibly know what this Dark Demon God Lightning was, but he
                                            could sense that it definitely posed a threat to his life. Howling in rage,
                                            he summoned the gold war wolf to his side and he leaped onto it. This time,
                                            he did not charge towards Zhou Weiqing anymore, instead turning to flee.</p>
                                        <p>The impression that Zhou Weiqing gave him was just a single one… Abnormal.
                                            That’s right, abnormal, just too strange indeed. A mere four-Jeweled
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master, yet he could actually injure him… that sheer strength
                                            of his was just too overbearing. Even if he had the Demonic Change State,
                                            the gap between their Heavenly Energy was just too huge, yet he was still
                                            able to use his strength and skills to injure Butler. In that moment, Butler
                                            felt a sense of foreboding. He had also seen the wall of flames behind him,
                                            and as a leader, being separated from his own troops was yet another factor
                                            in that sense of unease. At this point, if another powerhouse came to attack
                                            him, he might be doomed. With all the factors combined, Butler did not
                                            hesitate to turn and flee. Who said that a beastmen would definitely be
                                            stupid? When it truly came down to life and death, sometimes face was not
                                            that important.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Butler turn tail and run, Zhou Weiqing did not give chase. Currently,
                                            he was panting with ragged breath, his chest tight and seized up, and his
                                            vital energy within was disrupted and in a mess, almost causing him to vomit
                                            out blood. His ‘single’ strike might have seemed easy enough, but it was a
                                            combination of many Skills and calculation, and it had taken a huge toll on
                                            him, especially on his spirit and vigour. Furthermore, the difference
                                            between the two of their power levels was just too huge, even with the
                                            Demonic Right Leg in the Demonic Change State, he had actually been injured
                                            by the reverberations and backlash of the impact. Luckily, his goal had only
                                            been to land the Dark Demon God Lightning on his enemy, not to truly clash
                                            head on. Otherwise, as a four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master against a
                                            Nine-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, he knew he did not stand a chance.</p>
                                        <p>Butler had not lost in terms of strength, but in terms of strategy and
                                            underestimating his foe, allowing all of this which had happened to do so.
                                            He was also the first Heavenly Jewel Master to actually take the full power
                                            of the Dark Demon God Lightning head on.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing fought in more battles and cultivated further, his combat
                                            experience was already considerable. Especially in terms of fighting against
                                            those stronger than himself, his experience in that was truly impressive,
                                            and he had already formed a set of methods for him to deal with that. Zhou
                                            Weiqing was clear what his advantages were - to catch others by surprise. He
                                            had just too many abilities and Skills that were far beyond the common
                                            knowledge of most Heavenly Jewel Masters. For example, his Demonic Change
                                            State, Demonic Right Leg, Dark Demon God Lightning, and even the Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing understood that such powerhouses like Butler, as nine-Jeweled
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters, they were not just powerful, but also had much
                                            combat experience. As soon as Butler was familiarized with his own powers,
                                            approaches and styles, then he would stand no chance at all. As such, he
                                            could only use his advantages to the maximum, unleashing his all in a short
                                            period of time to damage his enemy.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, even Zhou Weiqing had not expected his plan to work this well. He
                                            had never dreamed that just by unleashing the Demonic Change State and the
                                            Heavenly Skill Image, he had already given his foe a huge scare, causing
                                            Butler to make several errors in judgement. Furthermore, the effect of the
                                            Dragon Silencing Seal was just too overbearing, and with all his preparation
                                            in that, he had succeeded just so finely, causing Butler to take such a huge
                                            disadvantage at once.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing’s plan was pretty good, but he had forgotten one
                                            thing. He had crafted it with Han Tianyou in mind, but he was after all a
                                            Heavenly King Stage powerhouse, and more so, one who had come from a Great
                                            Saint Lands. In terms of ability, vision and judgement calls, how could the
                                            wolfman tribe leader Butler be compared to Han Tianyou. Especially since Han
                                            Tianyou knew about him from Shen Little Demon and the other Heavenly Jewel
                                            Tournament Battle Team members. When Zhou Weiqing threw everything he had at
                                            someone, as long as he had sufficient preparation, and his enemy did not
                                            have enough knowledge about him or preparation, it was truly not an easy
                                            task to not fall for his traps.</p>
                                        <p>Simply put, Butler had charged forth crazily and in a straightforward
                                            fashion, and in a moment of underestimating his foe, Zhou Weiqing had
                                            managed to make use of that moment to strike with all he had and poison
                                            him.</p>
