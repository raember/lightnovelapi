                                            have also taken the shields and bows to play, so I can’t return those. As
                                            you know, these ruffians don’t listen much to orders… but at least the heavy
                                            armour should be no problem.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu’s eye muscles twitched noticeably. Facing that innocent smile of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s, she truly felt like giving him one tight slap and beat him to
                                            death. However, could she really do something like that? Of course not!</p>
                                        <p>That day, after they all left, Shen Ji had not told the others what happened,
                                            but he would not hide it from his junior little sister. That Shangguan
                                            Fei’er was from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was definitely a shock to them.
                                            Although Shen Ji had some status and power in the army, he was nothing
                                            compared to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. As such, they naturally thought
                                            that both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er were from the same place,
                                            otherwise with their age, how could their cultivation level be so high and
                                            power so great?</p>
                                        <p>As soon as they thought about the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, they naturally
                                            thought that the two were here on secret missions, and they would have to
                                            endure and tolerate them no matter what. Shen Ji had warned her severely not
                                            to disturb the Ruffian Battalion any longer, and if Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Shangguan Fei’er had any requests, to aid them without hesitation.</p>
                                        <p>For the Heaven’s Expanse Palace members to appear here, it was definitely a
                                            major issue. Shen Ji had reported it to their godfather / master, and had
                                            gotten the order to blackout the news, and let no one else learn of
                                            this.</p>
                                        <p>After all, the five Great Saint Lands… or more accurately, the four Great
                                            Saint Lands with the exception of the Heavenly Demon Sect, had previously
                                            had an agreement that none of them would interfere in ordinary wars, as that
                                            would bring the entire continent into a major war that could destroy
                                            everyone’s lives. At this point, since the Heaven’s Expanse Palace members
                                            had come here secretly, if the Heavenly Snow Mountain learned about this and
                                            took action, it could escalate into a major problem! As such, no matter
                                            what, they had to hide this secret as best they could, otherwise this might
                                            not end well.</p>
                                        <p>“Alright, how much do you want.” Shen Bu said solemnly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said with an embarrassed look on his face: “So sorry that
                                            Regiment Commander Shen Bu has to go through all this expense. You have
                                            already come all the way here personally, I would be embarrassed to ask for
                                            too much. Thirty thousand gold pieces, three hundred gold coins per set of
                                            heavy cavalry armour is cheap right? That is definitely a reasonable
                                            price.”</p>
                                        <p>Three hundred gold coins per set of heavy cavalry armour was indeed cheap,
                                            but the problem was, that was originally her Regiment’s armour! Having to
                                            pay for it again, Shen Bu’s feelings were indeed extremely vexed.</p>
                                        <p>However, she could only endure it, taking out thirty thousand gold coins,
                                            handing it to Zhou Weiqing, who immediately gave the order and had his men
                                            bring out the hundred heavy cavalry armour. They had already prepared the
                                            armour, as he had expected that Shen Bu was here to send them the gold.</p>
                                        <p>As for the thirty thousand gold coins, as he had promised, he did not keep
                                            any, dividing it to the Peerless Battalion soldiers who had snatched the
                                            armour originally.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu did not want to spend anymore time here, and now that her business
                                            was over, she quickly said: “Battalion Commander Zhou, I’ll take my leave
                                            then. Legion Commander Shen Ji asked me to pass the message to you that if
                                            you have any requirements, you can look for me directly.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “That would be so embarrassing!
                                            However, since Legion Commander Shen Ji has already said that, if I am too
                                            courteous, that will not be giving him face. Could I get two hundred
                                            thousand arrows and two thousand longbows as well as some food supplies? As
                                            you know, my brothers often go hungry.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu had just mounted her warhorse, and she almost fell down when she
                                            heard that. Whipping her head around angrily, she glared at Zhou Weiqing as
                                            she exclaimed: “Why don’t you say you want a thousand two hundred heavy
                                            cavalry armour instead?! You only have that many people, why do you want two
                                            thousand longbows?!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said with an aggrieved look: “I’m just afraid of any wear and
                                            tear. As for heavy cavalry armour, I do not need any, those are just too
                                            heavy, not suitable for us. If you really want to give me that, I’ll rather
                                            have that in gold coins.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu quickly left. Facing such a shameless person, she felt if she stayed
                                            any longer, she would be enraged until she vomited blood.</p>
                                        <p>However, to Zhou Weiqing’s immense surprise, within two days, the two
                                            thousand longbows and two hundred thousand arrows really arrived along with
                                            a round of supplies, including new tents, blankets, army uniforms, food etc.
                                            Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but marvel to himself about how much face the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace had. Hmm, with this ‘tiger skin’[1. Literal
                                            translation. Basically comes from an idiom literally called “fox borrows the
                                            tiger's ferocity.”, basically meaning to bully people by virtue of somebody
                                            else's influence. The old story goes as such: <i>‘One day, a tiger was out
                                                hunting for food. He caught a fox and was just about to eat it when the
                                                fox said: "How dare you to eat me? I am sent by heavenly god to this
                                                forest to rule all the beasts. If you eat me, you'll be going against
                                                god's will and you know what'll happen when God is angry."The tiger
                                                looked doubtful and thus the fox continued, "If you don't believe me,
                                                just walk behind me and see if any animal dares to approach me."The
                                                tiger agreed. The fox went ahead and the tiger followed closely. Seeing
                                                the tiger coming, all the animals ran away. The tiger thought that these
                                                animals were really in awe of the fox. Totally being convinced, the
                                                tiger let the fox go.</i>’], could he possibly command a Regiment
                                            without any complaints from them?</p>
                                        <p>Of course, he was just daydreaming about that, he would not try such a thing.
                                            Firstly, he had to get by Shangguan Fei’er about that first, and secondly,
                                            the Northern Army command were not fools, such a massive movement of troops
                                            was not something that could be done so easily.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>It seemed like the blink of an eye, and almost half a month passed since they
                                            had arrived at the Peerless Battalion. After these days of training and
                                            working, the emotions of these Peerless Battalion soldiers had been roused,
                                            no longer the bored and torpid semblance they had been last time. As for how
                                            much they had actually learned from the training, Zhou Weiqing was not too
                                            worried. After all, training was a process, a progressive thing. However, he
                                            had a very important question to ask Shangguan Fei’er, but these few days
                                            she had been hiding from him, causing him to be rather vexed.</p>
                                        <p>With all those new tents and bedding, it was much more comfortable to live in
                                            now, and Zhou Weiqing sat on his chair comfortably, his eyes closed. All of
                                            a sudden, the tent flap lifted and Shangguan Fei’er entered from
                                            outside.</p>
                                        <p>With a quick step in, Shangguan Fei’er stopped right there and said: “Why are
                                            you looking for me?”</p>
                                        <p>Ever since they had come back from the previous round, she had been in a
                                            fluster. After calming down from the high of emotions, when she thought back
                                            about it, no matter how she thought about it, her being together with Zhou
                                            Weiqing was definitely not proper. Just going past the rest of her family
                                            alone would be a huge problem, and more so, she did not want to become
                                            enemies with her sister. That was why she had been so focused on the close
                                            combat fight with the ruffian soldiers these few days, as the Heaven’s
                                            Expanse Palace Little Demon Girl, she was used to shifting her flustered
                                            emotions into violence, alas for the poor trainees.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood up and walked towards Shangguan Fei’er, with an expression
                                            on his face that made him look like an aggrieved little kid.</p>
                                        <p>“What are you doing?” A hint of worried flurry appeared in Shangguan Fei’er’s
                                            eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stopped about two yards from him, saying: “You’ve been avoiding
                                            me this past few days, right?”</p>
                                        <p>“No!” Shangguan Fei’er turned her head, refusing to look at him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath and said: “Alright, let’s get down to proper
                                            business.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er looked at him subconsciously. Originally, she thought he
                                            would stick to her and insist, but he did not do so. She was surprised to
                                            see that Zhou Weiqing’s expression was calm, expressionless, but yet such an
                                            expression caused her heart to feel a flavorless ache.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Fei’er, these few days you have seen for yourself.
                                            Amongst our Peerless Battalion soldiers, besides the over three hundred
                                            Physical and Elemental Jewel Masters, the rest of them might have some
                                            Heavenly Energy cultivation level, but mostly only at the second stage.
                                            However, their age is already past that of sixteen. My question is… does the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace have any secret arts that can allow them to Awaken
                                            their Personal Power Jewels as well?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er started, forcefully stabilizing her previously uneasy
                                            feeling, and she nodded, saying: “Yes, there is.”</p>
                                        <p>“Really?” It was Zhou Weiqing’s turn to be surprised.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said: “After the age of sixteen, the reason why people are
                                            unable to Awaken their Personal Power Jewels is because it has passed the
                                            time of their greatest growth and time for their bloodlines. If they want to
                                            Awaken it beyond that time, it will require the assistance of some treasured
                                            medicines, as well as the external assistance of Heavenly Energy to push
                                            through their meridians. As long as they break through the Third or Fourth
                                            stage of Heavenly Energy with that aid, they have the chance to become a
                                            Physical, Elemental or maybe even Heavenly Jewel Master.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Can we use that secret arts on our people? I believe the
                                            key would be some training technique?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er shook her head and said: “No, the key is actually the
                                            treasured medicines. En… in order to Awaken their Personal Power Jewels, the
                                            medicines are the most important. It requires several precious treasured
                                            materials together, but the important thing is it will not have any side
                                            effects, and more so has a good effect on future cultivation. Telling you
                                            this is not a problem, all our Heaven’s Expanse Palace disciples use this at
                                            a young age when we first start cultivating. Otherwise, how can our
                                            cultivation level raise so quickly? This sort of secret arts is not uncommon
                                            amongst the five Great Saint Lands, just that we do not spread it outside
                                            easily. Furthermore, such precious treasures are not so easily found.”</p>
                                        <p>“Would the Heavenly Jewel Island have those for sale?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er nodded her head and said: “Hmph, yes, but the price would be
                                            too expensive, you won’t be able to afford it.”</p>
                                        <p>“You have at least eight hundred men who need this medicine to Awaken their
                                            Personal Jewels. If you spend money to buy that, not just you, even an
                                            Empire like the Fei Li Empire would not be able to afford it.”</p>
                                        <p>Sometimes, when there was hope, and that hope was dashed, that was the most
                                            painful thing. The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing furrow his brow, Shangguan Fei’er said: “Actually, it’s
                                            not totally impossible. These materials might not be easily found elsewhere,
                                            but it is definitely available in the WanShou Empire. That is because only
                                            the WanShou Empire has that many Heavenly Beasts. The materials I mentioned
                                            are all various Heavenly Cores of different Heavenly Beasts.”</p>
                                        <p>“Ohh?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er continued: “A total of Five Heavenly Cores from different
                                            type of Heavenly Beasts, ground into dust and mixed together in a proper
                                            alchemical procedure. After which, it is mixed with a type of Heavenly Beast
                                            blood, then it will be complete.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s interest was greatly sparked, and he said: “Which five
                                            Heavenly Beasts? Oh right, and which Heavenly Beast blood?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er said: “Amongst the five Heavenly Beasts, there are three
                                            which are relatively easier to find, all Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts, not too
                                            powerful, and can be found even the northern borders. However, the other two
                                            are extremely rare, and they are also very powerful. When fully grown, they
                                            are at least at the Heavenly King Stage. If we meet an adult one, we will
                                            not be able to deal with them. Especially one of them, a Life Attribute
                                            Heavenly Beast, the totem of one of the three great tribes of the WanShou
                                            Empire, the Heavenly Life Tree Tribe. The Heavenly Beast blood that is
                                            required to mix the materials belongs to it as well.”</p>
