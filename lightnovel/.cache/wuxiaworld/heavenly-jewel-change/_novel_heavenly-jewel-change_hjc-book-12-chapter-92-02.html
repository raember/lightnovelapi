                                            two, her little head also resting comfortably on Zhou Weiqing’s poor arm. As
                                            such, the moment Zhou Weiqing turned his head to look, the first thing he
                                            saw was Fat Cat’s round, furry head.</p>
                                        <p>An evil, mischievous thought struck him, and with a huge grin, he lifted his
                                            hand and softly pinched Fat Cat’s nose.</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat was in a deep sleep, and even with her nose pinched, she actually
                                            didn’t wake up, instead opening her mouth and breathing through it.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing started a moment, before he almost burst out in laughter.
                                            Luckily, he managed to restrain himself, and he continued using his thumb
                                            and index finger to continue pressing her nose, and stretching his little
                                            finger down to press her jaw and closing her mouth.</p>
                                        <p>“--Wuu--” Fat Cat was startled awake, unable to breathe. When she opened her
                                            eyes, she saw Zhou Weiqing’s face with a wicked smile on it. Instantly, she
                                            struggled away from his hand, snarling as she pounced towards him.</p>
                                        <p>“Hahaha!” Zhou Weiqing burst out laughing uncontrollably, catching hold of
                                            Fat Cat and cuddling her into his embrace. At the same time, he exerted
                                            himself and pulled out his arm from under Little Witch’s head.</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch was also startled awake by that, and her eyes opened slowly,
                                            looking at the scene in front of her with blurry eyes. In the next instant,
                                            she saw Zhou Weiqing, and her eyes widened, pupils narrowing as she
                                            exclaimed in fright: “You… you… why are you on my bed?!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: “Get your facts straight okay? It is not me
                                            who is on your bed, but you on my bed. Who knows why you are on my bed…
                                            Hmph. Be honest, what did you do to me last night? I feel strange down
                                            there.”</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch vaulted up, jumping off the bed, looking at Zhou Weiqing
                                            suspiciously as she searched through her memory, straining to recall what
                                            had happened.</p>
                                        <p>Last night, all the members of the Fei Li Battle Team had been just too
                                            excited in celebrating, and all of them had drank too much. Of course, they
                                            did not use their Heavenly Energy to resist the effects of alcohol, or that
                                            would have been pointless. At first, Little Witch had only been drinking in
                                            order to get closer to them, as a way to improve her relationship with them
                                            buy drinking together. However, as time went by, and the effects of alcohol
                                            kicked in, she slowly integrated into the lively atmosphere of their little
                                            party.</p>
                                        <p>As the Holy Girl of the Heavenly Demon Sect, Little Witch had been given the
                                            most strictest education and upbringing since she was a little girl, and had
                                            never had the opportunity to surrender herself in such an indulgent abandon.
                                            Sensing the truly sincere joy from the other members of the Fei Li Battle
                                            Team, she slowly opened her heart and joined in the celebration, and at the
                                            end she had ended up being the one who drank the most, and even with the
                                            highest cultivation level, she had also ended up dead drunk. Her last memory
                                            was a blurry one of Zhou Weiqing telling her that he would send her back to
                                            her room.</p>
                                        <p>Who knows what had happened after that, and she had ended up here and
                                            sleeping the night.</p>
                                        <p>Quickly looking down at her clothes, they seemed messy but all in place, and
                                            she did not feel anything untoward in her body. Luckily, it looks like that
                                            little rascal did not try to take advantage of her.</p>
                                        <p>Even so, Little Witch blushed deeply. No matter how much she had been
                                            flirting with Zhou Weiqing in the past, that had been mostly an act. She was
                                            after all still a young girl who had never been touched by another man
                                            before, let alone sleeping together with one, even if nothing had really
                                            happened between them. It was more than enough for her to be so embarrassed
                                            that she wished the floor would open up and swallow her right at that
                                            moment.</p>
                                        <p>“You...!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her shamelessly, grinning as he said: “My dear
                                            beautiful lady, you must take responsibility for the things you do!”</p>
                                        <p>Little Witch grabbed a pillow from the side, throwing it savagely at Zhou
                                            Weiqing before fleeing the room at top speed.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly caught the pillow, looking at her run out. Only when she
                                            disappeared did the shameless look on his face disappear. In truth, he had
                                            been extremely embarrassed as well, and had only used this method to hide
                                            it. At least, this way, it wouldn’t be so awkward.</p>
                                        <p>Still, our Dear Little Fatty had an unbelievably thick skin, and his
                                            embarrassment lasted less than a few moments before he turned back into his
                                            usual self, muttering to himself: “Ahh, what have I done, I have truly lost
                                            out! Hugging a beautiful lady to sleep, and I actually didn’t do anything? I
                                            am worse than a beast! [1. This is a pun. Basically 禽兽 (beasts) and 禽兽不如
                                            (worse than beasts) are insults. Recently, especially in internet culture,
                                            there’s been a joke/pun about the two. Can’t really describe it, so i’ll
                                            give an example: ‘Eg. If I have intimate relations with this girl while
                                            she’s drunk, I’ll be a beast. But if I don’t take this opportunity, then I’m
                                            even worse than a beast!’. Not the best example, but that’s why sometimes
                                            it’s awkward to actually translate the meaning of a phrase =p Just like how
                                            other cultures wouldn’t understand memes I guess? Hope you guys got the gist
                                            of what it means]” As he said that, he nabbed up Fat Cat, giving her bottom
                                            a little smack and saying with a humph: “Fat Cat, were you the one who
                                            ruined my chances last night?”</p>
                                        <p>Fat Cat looked up, giving him the snub, a disdainful look in her eyes.</p>
                                        <p>In fact, Zhou Weiqing’s little joke had been the fact! It was indeed Fat Cat
                                            who had ruined his ‘chances’ last night. Originally, Zhou Weiqing had topped
                                            onto the bed with Little Witch in his arms the night before, and with their
                                            bodies rubbing against each other and in an alcohol daze, perhaps something
                                            else might have happened last night. However, Fat Cat forcefully squeezed
                                            between the two of them, separating them, and without any further bodily
                                            contact, the two had quickly fallen into a deep sleep.</p>
                                        <p>Ordinary people would have a hangover in the morning after such heavy
                                            drinking, with a headache and a dry mouth being the norm; some with weaker
                                            physiques might even take an entire day to recover. However, Heavenly Jewel
                                            Masters were much stronger, and just circulating their Heavenly Energy would
                                            allow them to recover swiftly, and the only detriment might just be an
                                            unusually deep sleep through the night.</p>
                                        <p>Since Zhou Weiqing was awake, he naturally did not let the others sleep
                                            further. Moving to all the rooms, he woke them up bathe, dress up, have
                                            breakfast, and pack up.</p>
                                        <p>Although all of them did not have sufficient sleep, none of them complained.
                                            After all, they were about to ascend the Heavenly Jewel Island, and no one
                                            wanted to be late for that!</p>
                                        <p>The dark green colour of their Fei Li Battle Team uniform was rather
                                            conspicuous, after all they had made their name fighting in the preliminary
                                            heats of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Even though it was still early in
                                            the morning when they left the hotel, the sun still rising in the morning
                                            sky, there were still passersby on the road who would gesticulate towards
                                            them, clearly having recognized them by their uniforms.</p>
                                        <p>Before long, they had reached the ZhongTian Plaza. The Skill Storing Palace
                                            of the ZhongTian Empire was right beside the Plaza.</p>
                                        <p>As they headed towards the Skill Storing Palace, they were suddenly blocked
                                            by a group of people.</p>
                                        <p>Stopping, they saw some familiar faces. Shen Little Demon, Lan Feg, as well
                                            as the other Dan Dun Battle Team members.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo reacted quickly, taking a step forward ahead of the rest of the
                                            Fei Li Battle Team members. Looking at Shen Little Demon, he said solemnly:
                                            “Team Leader Shen, how may I help you?”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Little Demon glanced at Lin TianAo, before turning to look at Zhou
                                            Weiqing. “Zhou Weiqing, the mountains stand motionless but the water will
                                            continue flowing, this is not the end of it. I will always remember the
                                            lesson you have ‘gifted’ me. Senior Shangguan can protect you for now, but
                                            he will not be able to protect you forever. With your age, I believe that
                                            you will definitely be joining the next Heavenly Jewel Tournament. At that
                                            time, I will be thirty… and we will meet again.”</p>
                                        <p>From Shen Little Demon’s eyes, Zhou Weiqing could see the venom within.
                                            Smiling faintly, he said: “Miss Shen, do you really need to do that? Isn’t
                                            that just a loss? You seeded teams have occupied these positions for much
                                            too long, and change is always good right? What we have done is for your own
                                            good after all. Taking a fall is not a bad thing, and that will give you the
                                            drive to improve yourselves. Instead of thanking me, you are actually trying
                                            to take revenge? Do not worry, I will not hide away, and I will definitely
                                            be joining the next Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Next time, it will not be
                                            such a close shave anymore. I await our next fight.”</p>
                                        <p>The Dan Dun Battle Team members glared angrily at Zhou Weiqing, almost on the
                                            verge of charging forth and brawling with him. Shen Little Demon lifted a
                                            hand to stop her companions, before saying coldly: “Zhou Weiqing, the next
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament is your death date. Let’s go.”</p>
                                        <p>After saying that, she turned and left, leading her team members away.</p>
                                        <p>As he watched their backs leaving, Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said:
                                            “Whether or not it is my death date is not decided yet, but Shen Little
                                            Demon, at that time, you better not let me have to cure your poison once
                                            more, and letting me touch your chest again. Aiiiyahh, it is not easy to be
                                            a good person these days! My kindness is repaid with ingratitude!”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Little Demon was enraged until she almost spit out a mouthful of blood.
                                            Her body froze for a moment, before increasing her pace and leaving.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at their retreating figures, Lin TianAo shook his head. “These seeded
                                            teams have truly been at the top for too long, and they aren’t able to
                                            accept any losses. Still, it isn’t a good thing to make too many enemies.
                                            Weiqing, remember this, being too inflexible also means being easier to
                                            break as well.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, saying: “However, if there is no anger or enmity, there
                                            is no struggle. Stress and pressure also gives motivation, forcing us to
                                            work hard in cultivating. As long as we keep up and stay strong ourselves,
                                            so what if they are Great Saint Lands?”</p>
                                        <p>*Clap**Clap**Clap* Little Witch was clapping away at the side. “That’s right!
                                            No need to be afraid of them! If they have the ability, let the Blood Red
                                            Hell come to the west, I will make sure they get more than they bargained
                                            for.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at her, saying exasperatedly: “From what I see, you are
                                            just happy to see the world in chaos. Come on, let’s report to the Skill
                                            Storing Palace.”</p>
                                        <p>By now, Little Witch had also recovered to her normal state, as if nothing
                                            had happened last night. However, if one were to look closely, one might be
                                            able to notice that when she looked at Zhou Weiqing, her gaze seemed to
                                            linger slightly longer than usual.</p>
                                        <p>Being held up by the Dan Dun Battle team did not affect the good moods of the
                                            Fei Li Battle Team, and they continued towards the Skill Storing Palace.</p>
                                        <p>As the Heavenly Jewel Tournament had ended, the ZhongTian Plaza had reverted
                                            to its normal state, and was once again open to the public. As they passed
                                            by the Plaza, they finally reached the enormous Skill Storing Palace, which
                                            was as large and grand as any Royal Palace.</p>
                                        <p>There were specially-assigned people awaiting for them at the Skill Storing
                                            Palace, all judges from the Heavenly Jewel Tournament Preliminary Heats. As
                                            soon as they reached the entrance, one of them guided them into the Skill
                                            Storing Palace.</p>
                                        <p>Entering this largest Skill Storing Palace in the entire ZhongTian Empire,
                                            Zhou Weiqing and his companions couldn’t help but look around in awe.</p>
                                        <p>This Skill Storing Palace was just too huge, and just the entrance hall alone
                                            was more than fifty metres tall, and looking across that hall gave a
                                            boundless feel.</p>
                                        <p>Just like the previous Skill Storing Palaces Zhou Weiqing had visited in the
                                            past, there were also many exits in the entrance hall for the various
                                            different Attributes. Of course, these exits were a lot larger, and to the
                                            left of every door, there was a huge, glowing gem of about a chi wide, that
                                            was like a mirror. Beside the door stood an employee of the Skill Storing
                                            Palace, dressed in white, looking to be guarding something.</p>
                                        <p>The guide who had brought them into the hall said: “Please wait here, the
                                            other battle teams have not reached yet, so you’ll have to wait for them. I
                                            will be reporting to the Palace Master, and you all can have a look around.
                                            If you need anything, you can ask any of the other employees and they can
                                            introduce you to what you require.” After saying that, he left, leaving the
                                            team to their own devices.</p>
                                        <p>Immediately, Zhou Weiqing did not hesitate as he walked towards the large
                                            doors on the right signifying the ‘other’ Attributes. Up until now, his Time
                                            Attribute only had a single Skill Stored within, the Absolute Delay. Yet,
                                            just the Absolute Delay alone had saved his life many times, snatching
                                            victories from the jaws of defeat especially against stronger opponents.
                                            Since the ZhongTian Skill Storing Palace was so huge, he decided to try his
                                            luck, hopefully they would have a Heavenly Beast with the Time Attribute for
                                            him to Store other Skills.</p>
