                                            up, Zhou Weiqing gave Shangguan Fei’er a signal.</p>
                                        <p>If the encroaching trio were ordinary eight-Jeweled powerhouses, they might
                                            not need be too afraid. After all, both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er
                                            were powerful beyond their level, both having Legendary Sets. With Lin
                                            TianAo’s powerful defense to support them, they might not lose in a three
                                            versus three fight.</p>
                                        <p>The three figures finally landed about a dozen yards from Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            trio. Just as Zhou Weiqing was seizing them up with a critical eye, he heard
                                            a surprised cry from Shangguan Fei’er. “Lion Prince!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had not expected that Shangguan Fei’er would actually know their
                                            opponents, and he started slightly before focusing on them.</p>
                                        <p>Of the three figures, the one in the middle was clearly the leader. He was
                                            tall and well built, even taller than Zhou Weiqing by half a head. His hair
                                            was a brilliant golden red, the long hair swirling in the wind behind his
                                            back, and his features were handsome and resolute; especially his eyes,
                                            which were staring fiercely at Zhou Weiqing, giving him a sense of a
                                            powerful pressure. He was dressed in light gold robes, giving him an
                                            impressive and dignified overall look…… Lion Prince?</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, this was the Lion Prince Gu YingBing. Gu YingBing was flanked on each
                                            side by an old man, both looking to be about sixty years of age or so,
                                            equally large and muscular built, red haired and with the same pale golden
                                            robes. However, the greatest difference between them and Gu YingBing was
                                            that their hair did not have the same lustrous golden hue, and this was also
                                            the reason why any onlooker could clearly see why the Lion Prince was the
                                            leader with just a single look.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er’s expression was extremely ugly. Naturally, she knew the
                                            Lion Prince Gu YingBing very well. Three years ago, both she and Shangguan
                                            Xue’er had accompanied their Uncle and Father to join the Five Great Saint
                                            Lands Fight on the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and she had met him then. If
                                            Shangguan Xue’er was the top fighter in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace younger
                                            generation, then this Gu YingBing was the strongest fighter in the entire of
                                            the Five Great Saint Lands younger generation. Three years ago, he had
                                            already reached the top level of the seven-Jeweled stage, and by now, she
                                            could easily guess that he had long broken through to the eight-Jeweled
                                            cultivation level.</p>
                                        <p>Not only was the Lion Prince the main disciple of the Heavenly Snow Mountain,
                                            he was also the future heir of the WanShou Empire Royal Family, the Heavenly
                                            Divine Earth Spirit Lion Tribe. Whether or not he would actually inherit the
                                            throne in the future, or become the next Leader of the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain, it was without a doubt that he was of utmost rank in the entire
                                            WanShou Empire. For one such a the Lion Prince to appear here so suddenly,
                                            and furthermore it was he who had shouted out Zhou Weiqing’s name, could it
                                            be he was here to take revenge for the two Regiments? Yet, how could he have
                                            known and responded so quickly? More so, the Heavenly Snow Mountain was also
                                            restricted by the Five Great Saint Lands agreement, and they would not
                                            easily intervene in the ordinary wars of lands.</p>
                                        <p>Since she did not know the reason why Gu YingBing had appeared here,
                                            Shangguan Fei’er said coldly: “The grand main disciple of the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain, future heir of the WanShou Empire, actually deigns to enter deep
                                            into our ZhongTian Empire territory, are you breaking the promise of the
                                            Five Great Saint Lands to intervene in the war between the Empires?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er was extremely intelligent in her own right, and her words
                                            mere directed both at Zhou Weiqing and the Lion Prince, to inform Zhou
                                            Weiqing of the other’s identity and status, while using the words to also
                                            spite the Lion Prince.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing’s gaze had been fixed upon Zhou Weiqing the moment he arrived. In
                                            fact, the whole reason why the WanShou Empire had increased the amount of
                                            armies here against the Northwest Armies was because of him. He was here
                                            specially to look for Zhou Weiqing, ever since he had seen the image of him
                                            that day. However, the Northwest Armies numbered more than a hundred
                                            thousand strong, and it would not be easy to look for him. As such, the Lion
                                            Prince brought two attendants to the border to wait.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, he had suddenly received news from the front lines that two of
                                            their vanguard Regiments had met with formidable enemies. Instantly, he had
                                            thought about Zhou Weiqing bringing his men to snipe the Swift Wolf Regiment
                                            previously. With that thought in mind, he immediately rushed over as quickly
                                            as he could. The three of them had been quite a distance away, but he had
                                            sensed the presence of a Heavenly Skill Image. In terms of his senses, as a
                                            member of the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion, he had one of the strongest
                                            Heavenly Beast bloodlines along with the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers.
                                            Their senses and perception were much stronger than most others.</p>
                                        <p>The sensory feeling of the Heavenly Image Image confirmed Gu YingBing’s guess
                                            to himself, and that was the reason for the shout earlier. The name ‘Zhou
                                            Weiqing’ he had learned from Tian’er. After he had brought the Wolf Prince
                                            to the Heavenly Snow Mountain to receive healing, Tian’er and Gu YingBing
                                            had another series of interactions, but in the end he had still came to the
                                            border to look for Zhou Weiqing and settle everything. However, even he had
                                            not expected that this meeting between he and this human who had stolen his
                                            fiancee’s heart and body would come so soon.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he looked at Zhou Weiqing, the Lion Prince’s eyes were filled with
                                            fire as he fixed his gaze. Since he had already seen him in Butler’s
                                            memories, he definitely would not be mistaken about his identity. Only now
                                            when he heard Shangguan Fei’er’s voice did he pay her attention.</p>
                                        <p>“You’re from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, that Shangguan…” The Lion Prince’s
                                            thick voice was filled with suppressed rage and mania.</p>
                                        <p>“I am Shangguan Fei’er.”</p>
                                        <p>The Lion Prince said coldly: “You ask me why I am here, what about you? If I
                                            did not guess wrongly, you are the one who should have intervened in the
                                            fight between our Empires. However, I do not have time to waste on you.
                                            Today, I am here for him, and it is a personal matter.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s brow furrowed slightly. “Personal matter? I do not think I
                                            know you right?” He was rather curious inwardly. After all, with Shangguan
                                            Fei’er’s introductory words, how could he not understand the sheer power of
                                            this Lion Prince. All of a sudden, inspiration struck him, and his face
                                            changed. He suddenly thought of a possible reason why the Lion Prince would
                                            look for him.</p>
                                        <p>“You do not recognize me, but you should recognize Tian’er right? I am
                                            Tian’er’s fiance.” Gu YingBing’s words were forced out through gritted
                                            teeth. He truly did love Tian’er. In terms of age, he was more than ten
                                            years older than Tian’er, and could be said to have watched her grow up. He
                                            had always been waiting for her, and their marriage was not just only
                                            totally a political one. Otherwise, once he had known about how she had lost
                                            her ‘virtue’, he could have refused the marriage and gotten other benefits
                                            from his teacher instead. However, he did not do that, instead persisting in
                                            wanting to marry Tian’er. It was not to ingratiate himself with Xue AoTian,
                                            but because he truly loved Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, as he saw this man who had stolen Tian’er’s heart and body,
                                            how could he not be filled with hatred.</p>
                                        <p>This time, Zhou Weiqing totally understood his guess was right. He might not
                                            know why the Lion Prince knew about him or how he managed to find him, but
                                            he knew that there was totally no longer any room for manoeuvre in this
                                            matter.</p>
                                        <p>“Is Tian’er alright?” Facing his love rival with eyes spitting with fire,
                                            Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but be filled with worry about Tian’er, and he
                                            subconsciously asked.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing said coldly: “What right do you have to ask anything about
                                            Tian’er? What do you think you are?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s gaze turned cold. Both men stood there, staring at each other,
                                            like two raging bulls ready to fight for a mate. The scent of gunpowder
                                            between them grew stronger and stronger, as if a fight would erupt at any
                                            time.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo subconsciously took a step closer to Zhou Weiqing. As he grew
                                            closer, he could naturally sense the sheer power and danger from Gu
                                            YingBing.</p>
                                        <p>“I challenge you. If you are a man, stand out and fight.” As he said that, a
                                            powerful violent aura of Heavenly Energy burst forth from Gu YingBing, along
                                            with a brilliant golden-red light that enveloped his entire body, spreading
                                            outwards. Eight Icy Jade Physical Jewels denoting the Strength Attribute
                                            appearing flagrantly around his right wrist, as his hand pointed towards
                                            Zhou Weiqing, the ferocious light in his eyes as if wanting to tear him
                                            apart.</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty, no!” Shangguan Fei’er said urgently. She could naturally hear
                                            that Zhou Weiqing and Gu YingBing were fighting because of a woman… in fact,
                                            she had met Tian’er before, but at this moment, she could no longer care
                                            about being jealous. She was very clear what power Gu YingBing held. After
                                            all, even her sister Shangguan Xue’er was not comparable to the Lion Prince
                                            Gu YingBing, let alone Zhou Weiqing. The Lion Prince Gu YingBing was no
                                            ordinary eight-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master indeed!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing turned to look at Shangguan Fei’er, before saying in a serious
                                            tone. “This is not a challenge that I can back down from.” As he said that,
                                            he turned back to Gu YingBing and said solemnly: “Please.”</p>
                                        <p>This fight was because of Tian’er, a fight between men, and there was nothing
                                            else to be said about it. Only strength and power could solve the dispute
                                            between them, the enmity between them. Both sides held equally strong
                                            killing intent towards the other.</p>
                                        <p>Even though he knew that his power was no match for his opponent, Zhou
                                            Weiqing would not back down. Otherwise, he would no longer have any
                                            qualification to love Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was indeed afraid of dying, but in some scenarios, he would
                                            never back down. Hidden deep within the marrow of his bones, there was that
                                            hot blood and burning ardour of youth indeed.</p>
                                        <p>Gu YingBing waved back, and the two old men who were flanking him slowly
                                            stepped back, forming an empty space about them.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Fei’er was about to speak out more, but was stopped by Lin TianAo,
                                            who stepped back first. Although Shangguan Fei’er was totally unwilling,
                                            what could she do at this point? She could only scold Zhou Weiqing in her
                                            heart for being such a playboy, while trying to hide her worry inside. At
                                            the same time, she was fully prepared to intervene if the Lion Prince really
                                            tried to give Zhou Weiqing a killing blow.</p>
                                        <p>As the other four stepped away, only Zhou Weiqing and Gu YingBing were left
                                            facing each other. Neither of them backed away, their gazes locked in a
                                            ferocious, forceful glare.</p>
                                        <p>This was a fight between love rivals, and there was no turning away.</p>
                                        <p>The one who struck out first was Zhou Weiqing. His cultivation level was no
                                            match for his opponent, and he would not allow the Lion Prince to continue
                                            building up his aura to the maximum. If that happened, it would be easy for
                                            him to be taken down in a single blow.</p>
                                        <p>With a low howl, Zhou Weiqing charged forward like a speedy arrow. In mid
                                            air, he had already completed a series of actions, entering the Demonic
                                            Change State instantly. He knew that without the Demonic Change State, he
                                            would not even stand a tiny chance. At the same time, the Heavenly Skill
                                            Image of the Demonic Dragon Lady appeared above his head. The Dragon
                                            Silencing Seal was another critical key to his small chance of victory.</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing moved, Gu YingBing had also reacted. With a loud
                                            shout, his hair of golden red hair billowed in the wind, a thick gold light
                                            gushing out of his body as he charged forward. He did not have any
                                            flourishes, just punching directly towards Zhou Weiqing’s chest.</p>
