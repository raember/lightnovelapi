                                            be so arrogant?”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao couldn’t help but laugh as he said: “Junior, you are an intelligent
                                            person, how could yo say something like that. If not for the fact that it
                                            was Her Highness, the Principal, at the head personally settling things,
                                            these people would not be waiting outside for you, and would have long since
                                            stormed inside to find you. However, even with our Principal’s status,
                                            facing so many nobles, it will be tough for her to withstand such pressure.
                                            Junior, you need to prepare yourself. However, I still believe that the
                                            academy will be able to deal with the situation. After all, they have
                                            already announced their decision, and it is unlikely they will change their
                                            tune suddenly.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said impassively: “Thanks so much for Senior for taking the
                                            trouble to come here to inform me about the situation. I will not forget
                                            this favour.”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao waved his hand and said: “I did not come here to warn you in order
                                            to get any favour. Did you think any ordinary person is worthy of my time to
                                            warn? I did not come here to get a debt from you. In my eyes, I consider you
                                            the dangerous sort, especially your future, it is just too danger. I do not
                                            want to be an enemy to someone so dangerous… as such, I can only try to be
                                            your friend.”</p>
                                        <p>Their eyes met, and Zhou Weiqing smiled and nodded. Extending his right hand,
                                            he said: “From now on, we are friends. However, my principles will not
                                            waver, do not think you can get any of the commoner students from me.”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao laughed and said: “Since we are friends, those commoner students
                                            are considered under you, what big difference is there if they are under me.
                                            I have heard that you have proclaimed that you will definitely become a High
                                            Level Consolidating Equipment Master within the next four years. I am
                                            looking forward to that! In the future, if you have any Consolidating
                                            Equipment Scrolls for sale, do remember to look for me, I will definitely
                                            give a good price. Come on, let’s go, I’ll bring you to the side to enter.
                                            These people are fools, as if blocking the main entrance will be of any use,
                                            and we can’t just vault over the wall.”</p>
                                        <p>To be honest, Zhou Weiqing did not really want to be friends with Ye Paopao,
                                            at least not at this point in time. That was because he was unable to read
                                            this person, and he felt that he posed almost as much danger as Ming Hua.
                                            However, right at this moment, he did not have any choice. After entering
                                            the Fei Li Military Academy for just barely a few days, he had already made
                                            so many enemies. If he made another enemy for no purpose, that was just
                                            being foolish. Furthermore, he was extending a friendly hand now.</p>
                                        <p>After detouring around the main entrance, the three of them entered from the
                                            sides. It had to be said that the Fei Li Military Academy walls were
                                            actually extremely high, almost six metres tall, with sharp metal spikes on
                                            the top as well. This was highly difficult for any ordinary person to scale,
                                            but to powerful Jewel Masters like them, it was not much of an obstacle.</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao pointed above and smiled, saying: “Let’s enter from here then.” As
                                            he said that, he lifted his right hand, and a dim blue light shone forth
                                            from his palm, and an ice pillar coalesced. An amazing sight followed, as
                                            the ice pillar continued growing larger, bringing Ye Paopao’s body along
                                            with it. In a matter of moments, it had grown past the six metre mark, and
                                            Ye Paopao quickly stepped off over, dropping down beyond the wall.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er exchanged a rather surprised look. Both of
                                            them had sensed that when Ye Paopao created the ice pillar, he had not used
                                            any skill. WIthout question, his Elemental Jewel was water, and he had made
                                            use of water to form ice just with his Heavenly Energy and Attribute. That
                                            sheer control and amount of Heavenly Energy was rather impressive. From
                                            that, it was clear that he was likely of higher cultivation level than them,
                                            perhaps about the same as Ming Hua, a four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master.
                                            The reason why he was most likely a Heavenly Jewel Master was because only
                                            they would have the purity of Element to be able to change water to ice so
                                            easily.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing’er by her slim waist, and striking the
                                            ground with his right foot, a muffled *Bang* sounded out, and the two of
                                            them flew all the way above the six feet wall to the other side. With this,
                                            he totally used only physical strength, and was also carrying another person
                                            to boot. With that, he slightly showed down Ye Paopao. Of course, this was
                                            due to the power of the Demonic Right Leg, but since Ye Paopao had already
                                            showed some of his power, how could Zhou Weiqing back down. To be friends
                                            with a person like Ye Paopao, one had to prove to be his equal, otherwise
                                            the friendship might turn into something else.</p>
                                        <p>“Junior has indeed much skill.” Ye Paopao praised him, a flash of surprise
                                            crossing his eyes. Although he did not personally look at Zhou Weiqing
                                            jumping, he could still tell from the energy in the air that Zhou Weiqing
                                            had not used any Heavenly Energy at all.</p>
                                        <p>“Senior is also extremely powerful, even if you were to be in the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master Academy, I estimate that Senior will be one of the top
                                            echelons.” Praise was after all free, and who didn’t know how to dole it out
                                            freely? However, not everyone had the great acting skills of Zhou Weiqing,
                                            who made it sound so sincere.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, Ye Paopao shook his head bitterly and said: “Junior, the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master Academy is not as simple as you think. To be brutally
                                            honest, in our academy, there are few who can compete with me. However, if
                                            we compare it to the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy, I would be hard pressed
                                            to squeeze into their top 50 ranks, out of their mere student population of
                                            only slightly more than a hundred. The Principal of the Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master Academy is our Empire’s top strongest Heavenly Jewel Master, he has
                                            broken past the Zong Stage and is the only ten-Jeweled King Stage Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master in our Empire. Furthermore, their focus is on fighting
                                            capabilities, and they have a lot of combat experience, while a lot of our
                                            studies and focus is on military knowledge, how could we possibly match
                                            them. Without any exaggeration, I would probably be unable to beat a
                                            three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master student of theirs.</p>
                                        <p>“King Stage Heavenly Jewel Master?” Both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er
                                            drew sharp breaths when they heard that. It might sound like a mere set of
                                            Jewels from 9 Jewels to 10 Jewels, but it was not as simple as that. High
                                            Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters were already extremely rare, but you
                                            could probably still find more than twenty or so in the entire Fei Li
                                            Empire. However, there was only the one single King Stage Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master, and that was already a whole new power level. To put things in
                                            perspective, a single Low Level King Stage Heavenly Jewel Master could
                                            easily take out ten High Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao smiled faintly and said: “There is no need to be so surprised,
                                            Junior. The Principal of the Heavenly Jewel Master also has another status,
                                            which is our Fei Li Empire’s Skill Storing Palace Master, and is also our
                                            Empire Premier Master, and he is already a Mid Level King Stage Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master.”</p>
                                        <p>Once a Heavenly Jewel Master reached the King Stage, the High, Medium and Low
                                            Levels were no longer according to the number of Jewels, but according to
                                            Heavenly Energy cultivation level. Just from that alone, one could tell how
                                            difficult it was to increase in power at that point.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath and said: “I never thought that the Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master Academy would be so powerful, and have such a background.”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao gave a cold smile and said: “No matter how powerful a Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master is, they are still a single individual. How can they compare
                                            with us, who will become great generals in the future? No matter how
                                            powerful an individual is, they will never be able to compete with an entire
                                            large army. After all, there is a limit to the amount of Heavenly Energy one
                                            can have, and it will run out eventually.”</p>
                                        <p>“Alright, I’ve said enough. Junior, I have to head back to my class. If you
                                            have any issues, do come and look for me. However, I might have to leave in
                                            a few days time. If possible, I suggest that you do not leave the academy in
                                            the near future, and just stay in the dorms for a while for your own safety.
                                            With our Princess as our Principal, no one will dare to come into the
                                            Academy to look for trouble. After yesterday’s fight, your commoner class
                                            one has already gained their reputation, and it is likely that any of the
                                            students will cause more trouble.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “As long as Senior doesn’t come looking for
                                            trouble with me, I am not afraid of anyone else.”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Paopao laughed heartily and waved towards Zhou Weiqing, before turning to
                                            leave.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er reached their classroom, they
                                            immediately felt that the atmosphere was rather strained.</p>
                                        <p>The class was extremely quiet. Ming Hua had already arrived, and was seated
                                            at the front with her brow furrowed slightly. When Zhou Weiqing entered,
                                            everyone turned to look at him, and some of the students even stood up.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, are you alright?” At least a dozen concerned voices sounded out
                                            instantly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “What is up with you all? It’s just a small
                                            matter, how could anything happen to me?”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua said exasperatedly: “You have caused trouble with more than a dozen
                                            noble families, of which there are two Dukes, six Marquis, and nine counts,
                                            the rest being viscounts. Is that still considered a small matter? Even the
                                            Principal is having trouble dealing with them, and you are treating it as
                                            nothing?”</p>
                                        <p>One of the other classmates stood up abruptly, exclaiming: “Monitor,
                                            yesterday’s incident was done by all of us. Damn it, since a young age, I
                                            have never experienced such a great feeling. If the academy punishes you,
                                            count me in, I will share the responsibility.”</p>
                                        <p>As soon as he said that, it resonated with all the commoner students, and
                                            instantly a commotion arose in the entire class.</p>
                                        <p>“That’s right, boss! We will all share responsibility! Didn’t you say before,
                                            we are an entire family. All for one, and one for all!”</p>
                                        <p>Seeing his classmates’ excited expressions, Zhou Weiqing felt a warmth in his
                                            heart. He knew that his efforts over the past few days had not gone to
                                            waste. Not only had they approved of him, their competitive spirits and
                                            fighting spirits had also been sparked. This was the most important
                                            gain.</p>
                                        <p>Even Ming Hua stared at the entire class, stunned. She had after all been
                                            through the student phase, but she had never seen a class so united, a
                                            single student so respected and beloved by everyone. This was just a few
                                            days from the start of school, what was going on? If this went on for a
                                            longer period, would these commoner students be even willing to die for
                                            him?</p>
                                        <p>At this moment, Ming Hua suddenly felt that her father’s insight was indeed
                                            clear. Zhou Weiqing was not just a simple sly, cunning and powerful person.
                                            He had a strange leadership quality that just could not be described. Unlike
                                            her big brother’s leadership, Zhou Weiqing’s was the sort that could make
                                            his followers crazy, perhaps leading them in some ‘bad’ ways. Ming Hua was
                                            unable to describe the feeling, but she could clearly feel that it was just
                                            like her father had said, they could no longer afford to antagonize him
                                            further, to make him an enemy of their Sect.</p>
                                        <p>“Alright, alright. Everyone quieten down.” Zhou Weiqing raised his hands,
                                            motioning for silence. With a faint smile, he said: “Enough said. Yesterday,
                                            our Principal has already announced her decision, and there will not be any
                                            further changes. Furthermore, even if anything crops up, I do not need you
                                            to share the responsibility. After all, that is what the monitor is for. Do
                                            you think you call me Boss for nothing? The Boss is there to take the
                                            pressure!”</p>
                                        <p></p>
