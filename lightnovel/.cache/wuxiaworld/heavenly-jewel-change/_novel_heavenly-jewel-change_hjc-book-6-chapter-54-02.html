                                            profile, there shouldn’t be any major problems. The most important thing now
                                            for him was to quickly purchase the various materials and ingredients for
                                            him to continue creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. After all, these
                                            scrolls were just pure profit, and he needed to keep earning as much as he
                                            could so that he had the finances when he eventually returned to the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire.</p>
                                        <p>The other reason why Zhou Weiqing had taken it upon himself to create
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for his classmates was a form of training.
                                            Just simply following the steps or the previously designed Scrolls which
                                            Huyan Aobo had taught him, there wasn’t much to improve besides increasing
                                            experience in creating them. However, to custom design and create
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for others, it was a whole different ball
                                            game. It would need him to actually fully understand the basics, to design
                                            everything from the start. For example, among the six sets of scrolls he had
                                            created yesterday, the one which had taken him to longest to create was the
                                            one he had custom designed and created for Kou Rui. In fact, almost half the
                                            entire time he had used was spent on that set.</p>
                                        <p>Ever since he had entered the Fei Li Military Academy, Zhou Weiqing had
                                            increasingly recognized the true importance of a Consolidating Equipment
                                            Master. Previously, he had known they were important in theory, but had not
                                            recognized the extent until he had witnessed it for himself. As such,
                                            becoming an outstanding Consolidating Equipment Master was now of even more
                                            importance to him than even becoming a powerful Heavenly Jewel Master. After
                                            all, only an outstanding Consolidating Equipment Master would be able to
                                            recruit many powerful Jewel Masters to stand by his side… and this was just
                                            exactly the key to the Heavenly Bow Empire’s growth in the near future.
                                            Although the Fei Li Empire was much stronger, it was not his home, and in
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s heart, no country in the world could replace the standing of
                                            the Heavenly Bow Empire. That was the beauty of one’s motherland.</p>
                                        <p>“Dearest, it’s time for class…” Zhou Weiqing dipped his head down and kissed
                                            Shangguan Bing’er on the cheeks.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er opened her eyes blurrily to see a mouth heading down
                                            towards her, and in shock she quickly dodged aside. Jumping up, she
                                            remembered where they were, and blushed deeply as she told Zhou Weiqing:
                                            “Little Fatty, this is in academy grounds, you should control yourself…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was delighted, saying: “Does that mean… when we’re home later at
                                            night, I do not need to control myself…?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Bing’er giggled and said: “Enough of that, I’m immune to your
                                            tricks now. Let’s go to class now, come on!”</p>
                                        <p>The class in the afternoon was personal military training, and was held right
                                            in the main square. Personal military training was to build up their solo
                                            fighting capabilities, and not just in terms of Jewel Masters fighting.
                                            Among other things, there was fighting styles, hand to hand combat, hiding
                                            and concealment, ambushes, sniping and assassinations, luring the enemy and
                                            other various individual combat tricks and capabilities. In the Fei Li
                                            Military Academy, this was one of the most important classes. Every year,
                                            this was one of the three most important exams to pass, with the other two
                                            being battle analysis and strategy, and they had to be passed with a single
                                            try. For other classes, there was still the opportunity of a re-exam, while
                                            if any student failed any of this three main classes, they would be expelled
                                            from the academy.</p>
                                        <p>The Fei Li Military Academy Main Square was extremely huge, and the commoner
                                            class one’s students were gathered on the left side of it. On the other
                                            side, there was another class gathered there… clearly they were also there
                                            to take the personal military training class. It was a senior noble class of
                                            around 40 or so students, and many of them looked towards Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            class when they gathered.</p>
                                        <p>“Form Squad… Attention!” Ming Hua’s voice rang out, and all twenty nine of
                                            the commoner students immediately arranged themselves into two rows. Zhou
                                            Weiqing and Ma Qun naturally ended up at the back of the rows.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing looked at Ming Hua, his eyes lit up. She had changed into a
                                            rose red attire, with her hair tied behind her head. At this point, she no
                                            longer had any hint of her previous seductive look, but had a valiant,
                                            battle ready look, full of fighting spirit.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua’s gaze swept across the faces of her students, and after confirming
                                            that they were all present, she nodded and said: “This morning’s test will
                                            be graded and returned to you within two days, though I believe many of you
                                            know how you have done deep in your hearts. I do not care what school you
                                            are from previously, but from now on, you are part of our illustrious Fei Li
                                            Military Academy, and you will study hard according to my requirements.
                                            Otherwise, I will not hesitate to expel anyone who fails at the end of the
                                            year. The students who do not finish their entire four years will not be
                                            allowed to mention that they are from our academy. Class Monitor…”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly stepped forth. “Here!”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua glanced at him and said: “Lead everyone to run ten rounds around the
                                            main square. You all have fifteen minutes to complete the rounds, and those
                                            who do not finish within the stipulated time will have to run another ten
                                            rounds.”</p>
                                        <p>“Yes.” Zhou Weiqing agreed. The main square was about eight hundred metres
                                            per round, though that was quite some distance, but to him, the ten rounds
                                            would be as easy as taking a stroll.</p>
                                        <p>“Teacher, do we Elemental Jewel Masters have to run as well?” At this moment,
                                            a soft, timid voice sounded out. It was a young girl, one of the students
                                            whom Zhou Weiqing remembered vaguely as one of the rare Elemental Jewel
                                            Masters in the class. She was of the Water Attribute, and her name was Ye
                                            Tingxue. Her looks were just above average, and she was a gentle, timid
                                            girl, her frail appearance seeming as if a gust of wind would blow her
                                            over.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua glanced at her and said passively: “I said everyone, didn’t you
                                            hear?”</p>
                                        <p>Ye Tingxue was startled into almost crying. She was a two-Jeweled Water
                                            Attribute Elemental Jewel Master, and though her physique was stronger than
                                            an ordinary human with her Heavenly Energy, she knew it would be impossible
                                            for her to run eight thousand metres in fifteen minutes. With the addition
                                            of the ten rounds penalty, she would be in deep trouble.</p>
                                        <p>It wasn’t just her. All the six Elemental Jewel Masters in the class revealed
                                            troubled looks on their face.</p>
                                        <p>“Attention! Right Turn.” Zhou Weiqing shouted out loud, glancing at Ming Hua.
                                            He laughed in his heart, thinking to himself: <i>Is this the ‘problem’ you
                                                have set me? You have severely underestimated me!</i></p>
                                        <p>“Ma Qun, Kou Rui, Yan Zhexi, Shangguan Bing’er, each of you bring along a
                                            Elemental Jewel Master classmate, while I will bring two.” Zhou Weiqing
                                            called out, before picking two of the male Elemental Jewel Master youths.
                                            His method was rather simple, grabbing each of them under his arms, before
                                            running at the head of the class.</p>
                                        <p>The four he had called out did not hesitate - Shangguan Bing’er went to Ye
                                            Tingxue, while Yan Zhexi and Kou Rui each quickly went for the last two
                                            female students. As for Ma Qun, he was too slow, left with the last student
                                            who was a rather heavyset male. Ma Qun scolded inwardly: <i>Ugh, I’m just a
                                                little too slow, such a disadvantage!</i> However, he did not hesitate
                                            as well, pulling that classmate along as he ran on. As for the rest of the
                                            Physical Jewel Masters, they naturally had no problem running, and all
                                            twenty nine of them charged forth along the running track.</p>
                                        <p>A hint of surprise appeared in Ming Hua’s eyes. She had not expected Zhou
                                            Weiqing to react so quickly, and with a wry twist to her mouth, she stood
                                            there recording the rounds.</p>
                                        <p>As Zhou Weiqing ran, he called out to the rest: “Our commoner class one is an
                                            entire group which works as one together. No matter what we do, we cannot
                                            leave anyone behind. If we are on the battlefield, our backs are given to
                                            our most trusted comrade in arms. Perhaps, we are still unable to reach that
                                            state, but let us work towards that together. Everyone just needs to
                                            remember that we are one. One for all, and all for one! [1. Ok this wasn’t
                                            there, I added it for fun :P Thought it was fitting]” As he said that, he
                                            thought to himself: <i>The best will be for all of us to move over to our
                                                Heavenly Bow Empire together too! Heh heh!</i></p>
                                        <p>Before long, they had completed the first round. Just as they were starting
                                            on their second round, all of a sudden, there was a loud ‘Aiyah’ sound, and
                                            one of the students fell down.</p>
                                        <p>Although Zhou Weiqing was right in front, he has been keeping track of his
                                            classmates  behind him. Turning around, he saw one of his male classmates
                                            fallen on the floor, his hands clutching his belly, his face a mask of pain.
                                            In front of him lay an arrow without the arrowhead.</p>
                                        <p>“Stop!” Zhou Weiqing shouted loudly, and all of them stopped, turning to the
                                            other class also going through the lesson at the other side of the main
                                            square.</p>
                                        <p>The noble class was currently practicing their archery, and their target was
                                            about a hundred yards or so away, while their entire class was at the side
                                            of the main square. No matter how you looked at it, it was impossible for
                                            them to have shot in this direction. Even if there was no arrowhead, but
                                            being shot at such a close distance, one could imagine the pain.</p>
                                        <p>The next moment, on of the noble students shouted over mockingly: “Aiyyaahh…
                                            I’m so sorry, my arrow went astray. This junior, are you okay?”</p>
                                        <p>The teacher of the noble class was not around, and they had been practicing
                                            their archery by themselves. After saying that, the noble student continued
                                            mockingly: “A moving target is indeed much more fun than a boring set
                                            target. If you all are interested, you can try! Haha!”</p>
                                        <p>His words caused the rest of the noble students to laugh uproariously, while
                                            the commoner students glared angrily at him.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua was currently in the midst of recording the rounds ran, and was also
                                            startled by the sudden incident. Luckily, the arrow had no arrowhead, or the
                                            student might have been heavily injured or killed.</p>
                                        <p>“Bastards, are you asking for death?” Ming Hua shouted angrily.</p>
                                        <p>The noble students were rather afraid of her. After all, the name of ‘Flower
                                            of Hades’ Underworld’ was notorious, and they immediately quietened
                                            down.</p>
                                        <p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing walked towards Ming Hua, murmuring
                                            something in her ears. Ming Hua furrowed her brow for a second in thought,
                                            before nodding to him. All of a sudden, she turned and walked off. Some of
                                            the more quick thinking members of the commoner class one revealed evil
                                            smiles as soon as they saw that.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing returned to his classmates, picking up the arrow and walking to
                                            the noble student who had spoken and calling out in a fake, kindly voice.
                                            “Senior, here is your arrow. I’ve picked it up for you.” His words were slow
                                            and with a hint of flattery, as if trying to fawn on the noble senior; and
                                            he had a big smile on his face. All of a sudden, he flicked his hand,
                                            sending the arrow forward.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, he was fifty feet from the noble students when he threw out
                                            the arrow. To the surprise of the commoner class one students, the arrow
                                            seemed to be even faster than when shot from the bow earlier, and it sped
                                            through the fifty yards in the blink of an eye.</p>
                                        <p>A loud pained cry sounded out as the arrow shot forth right into the noble
                                            student who had just turned around, and furthermore, it embedded itself
                                            right deep into an unmentionable place...</p>
