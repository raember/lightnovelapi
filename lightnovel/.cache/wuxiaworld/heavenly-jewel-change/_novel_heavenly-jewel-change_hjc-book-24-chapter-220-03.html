                                            laughingly: “That was not what I taught you! This big bro here is not so
                                            shameless!”</p>
                                        <p>Including Tian’er, the entire Heavenly Bow Battle Team gave Zhou Weiqing a
                                            contemptuous look.</p>
                                        <p>On the stage, another figure had appeared. TianFeng stood next to TianMa, one
                                            hand on his shoulders, helping him nurse his chaotic Heavenly Energy due to
                                            his rage.</p>
                                        <p>“Calm down. The humiliation they have given us, we will pay back ten times,
                                            hundred times more. There is no point raging pointlessly now. Senior
                                            Shangguan, the third match, both of us will be the fighters.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin looked at Tianfeng and nodded in agreement. However, he
                                            felt his heart grip inwardly. This TianFeng was much calmer and more stable,
                                            far beyond his brother TianMa, especially that cold calculation that lay in
                                            his bones. It was clear that he was narrow minded person who would seek
                                            vengeance for any minor grievances, but one who could complete control his
                                            emotions. Such a person was far more dangerous and deadly than his strength
                                            alone could account for.</p>
                                        <p>With his brother’s help, TianMa managed to gradually calm down, his Heavenly
                                            Energy also easing up. However, the bloodshot red in his eyes did not
                                            withdraw, clearly he truly hated the entire Heavenly Bow Battle Team
                                            now.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin said: “Dan Dun Battle Team against the Heavenly Bow Battle
                                            Team. Two versus Two. Third match. Both sides, please send your fighters up
                                            the stage.</p>
                                        <p>In a flash, two figures appeared from the Heavenly Bow Battle Team, hand in
                                            hand. Tian’er had already removed her bamboo hat, revealing her beautiful
                                            features.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing held her hands and they ascended the stage, instantly the
                                            phrase ‘fresh flower stuck on bull crap’ and similar phrases crossed all the
                                            rest houses.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing, both brothers TianMa and TianFeng’s eyes contracted,
                                            a powerful killing intent released without any attempt at hiding.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin was also secretly surprised in his heart. He knew that this
                                            next match was of utmost importance to both sides. Zhou Weiqing had used a
                                            four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master to ‘waste’ the second strongest
                                            powerhouse in the Dan Dun Battle Team, TianMa. Although that had been a loss
                                            of a match, in terms of strategy, it was a perfect victory. However, this
                                            current 2v2 match was perhaps the most critical one which would decide the
                                            outcome between both teams. After all, it was the fight between the
                                            strongest of both teams, and it would definitely be the most exciting fight
                                            of the entire Heavenly Jewel Tournament thus far. Being the judge for this
                                            match, it would not be so easy!</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou Weiqing, today I will tear you into bits!” The rage and venom that
                                            TianMa had just suppressed burst free once again, rising up as he saw Zhou
                                            Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Standing at Zhou Weiqing’s side, Tian’er gave a cold humph. “Aren’t you
                                            afraid of bragging so much you sprain your tongue? A mere Blood Red Hell,
                                            and you dare to be so arrogant in front of us.”</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>As soon as Tian’er appeared on the stage, the entire WanShou Battle Team
                                            members subconsciously dashed out of their rest house. In this year’s
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament, the WanShou Empire had definitely sent an elite
                                            team as well, and since they were mostly from the Heavenly Snow Mountain,
                                            how could they not recognize their Young Miss? However, at this point, it
                                            was clearly not the time or place to greet her.</p>
                                        <p>At the head, a youth who was clearly the leader couldn’t help but mutter to
                                            himself: “Now, it looks like that Dan Dun Battle Team will be in trouble
                                            after all.”</p>
                                        <p>At his side, another youth asked curiously: “Boss, didn’t you just say
                                            earlier that the Heavenly Bow Battle Team would not be a match for the Dan
                                            Dun Battle Team? Young Miss might be powerful, but she is just alone. Her
                                            cultivation level may not even be a match for the TianFeng and TianMa
                                            brothers right?”</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou Weiqing… that name… don’t you all find it familiar at all? Use your
                                            brains, why would the Young Miss actually appear here? Haven’t you forgotten
                                            what happened on the Heavenly Snow Mountain?”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, the entire WanShou Battle Team members’ jaws dropped. “He…
                                            he is that fellow who came to steal the bride?”</p>
                                        <p>The leader sighed and said: “Indeed! Even Senior Brother Gu was defeated by
                                            him… hmph, do you think the brothers TianFeng and TianMa can be compared to
                                            Senior Brother Gu? So, the truly dangerous one is not Young Miss, but him.
                                            Watch carefully and learn, this will be a true fight between top
                                            powerhouses. We are indeed very lucky not to meet the Heavenly Bow Battle
                                            Team in the top eight.” Clearly, he had already affirmed his belief on who
                                            the final team ascending to the top eight would be.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>On the stage, Shangguan Longyin’s expression grew bleak. “Enough, both teams,
                                            there is no point fighting with words. Both sides, introduce
                                            yourselves.”</p>
                                        <p>“Heavenly Bow Battle Team, Zhou Weiqing, Tian’er.”</p>
                                        <p>“Dan Dun Battle Team, TianFeng, TianMa.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Longyin swept his gaze across all four of them, before saying:
                                            “Know your limits. This is the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, not a life and
                                            death fight. Alright, fight, begin.”</p>
                                        <p>With both sides confronting each other with daggers drawn and sabres
                                            rattling, in such an aggressive manner, he couldn’t help but remind in a
                                            line. Of course, he did not have any goodwill towards the Dan Dun Battle
                                            Team. However, he did not want to see Zhou Weiqing suffer any loss. Even for
                                            him, he did not have a lot of hopes for Zhou Weiqing’s success. After all,
                                            Zhou Weiqing had just fought against Shen Little Demon, and to unleash that
                                            strange Silver Emperor, it should have taken quite a toll on him. The
                                            brothers TianFeng and TianMa were not only fresh, but also stronger than
                                            Shen Little Demon. Clearly, it would not be an easy fight at all.</p>
                                        <p>Along with Shangguan Longyin’s proclamation, the aura and presence that both
                                            sides had been holding in and building up smashed into each other instantly.
                                            Aura and presence was invisible and intangible, but it could put immense
                                            pressure on an opponent’s spirit.</p>
                                        <p>If it came to a clash of auras, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er would definitely be
                                            able to laugh to the end. Previously, on the Heavenly Snow Mountain, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had been able to clash auras with a Heavenly Emperor stage Heavenly
                                            Beast with the bloodline pressure. This was a type of clash of auras.</p>
                                        <p>The two brothers TianFeng and TianMa instantly felt a boundless and
                                            terrifying pressure, filled with noble grace and royal presence pushing down
                                            upon them from Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er. Vaguely, they sensed one black, one
                                            white, two massive tigers pouncing towards them.</p>
                                        <p>In that instant, both sides unleashed their Heavenly Jewels. Zhou Weiqing had
                                            six sets of Jewels, actually ending up the lowest of the four. Tian’er was
                                            at seven-Jewels, as was TianMa. However, when TianFeng released his Heavenly
                                            Jewels, even Zhou Weiqing’s pupils narrowed in surprise. He was at the
                                            eight-Jeweled stage!</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, TianFeng had released eight pairs of Heavenly Jewels. His Physical
                                            Jewels were the Icy Jade of the Strength Attribute, while his Elemental
                                            Jewels were also the Alexandrite Jewels of Dual Attributes. Powerful
                                            Heavenly Energy mixed into their auras, and the clash resumed.</p>
                                        <p>Both sides did not take action instantly; in this clash of auras, whoever
                                            took action first meant their aura and pressure was already at the
                                            disadvantage. This would not be a good sign. All of the four were top
                                            powerhouses in the younger generation, and they were all able to defeat
                                            enemies above their cultivation level. Naturally, they knew very well the
                                            advantage in moving first. However, that had to be in unison with a
                                            suppression of aura to be of proper use, rather than the reverse.</p>
                                        <p>Anyone could clearly see that from the aura that rose above the brothers
                                            TianFeng and TianMa, there was a faint gold-red light of Fire and Light,
                                            giving the audience a sensation like they were the rising sun in the
                                            skies.</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, TIan’er gave forth a brilliant gold, along with a swirling
                                            purple. The beautiful purple eyes of hers were also glowing brightly.</p>
                                        <p>The light around Zhou Weiqing was the strangest, six colours rising in
                                            unison, swirling around his body as they rose up. In terms of attributes, it
                                            was without question that Zhou Weiqing was the strongest amongst the
                                            four.</p>
                                        <p>Very quickly, the clash of aura and pressure showed the victor. Zhou Weiqing
                                            had the Dragon and Tiger bloodlines, while Tian’er had the pure Divine
                                            Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline. As both of them held hands, the four Saint
                                            Attributes were present as well. Although their overall cultivation levels
                                            and Heavenly Energy was lower, their aura and presence was far superior to
                                            their enemies.</p>
                                        <p>TianFeng and TianMa’s expressions turned grave. When Tian’er released her
                                            aura, they instantly recognized where she was from. However, at this point,
                                            it was too late to say anything, and it was more important to defeat their
                                            enemies.</p>
                                        <p>By now, all of the Battle Team members had walked out of their respective
                                            rest houses. Towards this major battle in front of them, they paid close
                                            attention, placing high importance upon it. The brothers TianFeng and TianMa
                                            were definitely shocking, but at the same time, this Heavenly Bow Battle
                                            Team had yet another hidden seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, with such
                                            powerful Attributes as well. They were equally shocking indeed. Besides the
                                            ZhongTian Battle Team who already knew of them beforehand, and the WanShou
                                            Battle Team who recognized them, all of the other teams were just filled
                                            with surprise and shock.</p>
                                        <p>This was destined to be a clash of the top! Originally, those who had looked
                                            down upon the Heavenly Bow Battle Team currently had very complicated
                                            feelings in their hearts.</p>
                                        <p>Facing the terrifying bloodline powers and the suppression of their enemies’
                                            aura, both TianFeng and TianMa began breathing heavily. TianFeng withdrew
                                            his gaze, and abruptly, he took a half step forward, the gold-red in his
                                            eyes changing suddenly as the purple of the Destruction Attribute
                                            appeared.</p>
                                        <p>TianMa and TianFeng could be said to be connected on a certain level. As soon
                                            as TianFeng activated his Destruction Attribute, TianMa’s eyes also flashed
                                            in a similar fashion. The powerful Destructive aura gave their highly
                                            suppressed auras a huge boost; though it wasn’t sufficient to turn to tides
                                            and allow them to suppress Zhou Weiqing and TIan’er, at least they were able
                                            to hold on.</p>
                                        <p>Despite that, the two brothers were still forced to make the first move, and
                                            their Consolidated Equipment appeared.</p>
                                        <p>Flashes of dark gold lit up around them one by one, as the light shield
                                            representing the God Tier Consolidated Equipment sprang up individually,
                                            causing the entire audience to erupt in surprise.</p>
                                        <p>It had to be known, normally it was extremely difficult to even see a single
                                            God Tier Consolidated Equipment, enough to shock anyone. However, in that
                                            series of bright flashes, the two brothers had unleashed a total of fifteen
                                            dark-gold light shields!</p>
                                        <p>Besides Legendary Sets, there was no other explanation for them having so
                                            many high level Consolidated Equipment.</p>
                                        <p>That was a hideous and savage scale armour. Indeed, hideous and savage was a
                                            very apt description. Their armour was clearly not fully completed yet, as
                                            the Consolidated Equipment was still the dark-gold colour that represented
                                            an incomplete Legendary set. Almost the entire armour was covered with sharp
                                            spikes, and on the chest area, there was a strange symbol of a crab. Even
                                            their helmets, both sides of them had four sharp spikes twisting about, as
                                            if the eight legs of a crab. The two of them had exactly the same
                                            Consolidated Equipment, fifteen God Tier Consolidated Equipment in total,
                                            and instantly their aura exploded forth in a massive boost, not only
                                            regaining all lost ground, but actually starting to be the suppressor
                                            instead.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of Consolidated Equipment, Zhou Weiqing could be said to be
                                            extremely knowledgeable and experienced already. As soon as both sides faced
                                            off, he could clearly sense that this TianFeng, in terms of cultivation
                                            level and overall combat prowess, was perhaps already a match for the Lion
                                            Prince Gu Yingbing. As one of the top in the Great Saint Lands younger
                                            generation, he was definitely top quality.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, that did not mean that Tian’er, Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan
                                            Fei’er could not compare to Gu Yingbing or this TianFeng. However, Tian’er,
                                            Shangguan Xue’er and the other girls were still much younger, far from
                                            reaching thirty years old. As a result, it was normal for them to have some
                                            gap in cultivation levels for now.</p>
                                        <p>No matter Shen Little Demon, TianFeng or TianMa, they all had the Destruction
                                            Attribute. It was clear that this Destruction Attribute was not inborn, but
                                            somehow cultivated by them in recent times.</p>
