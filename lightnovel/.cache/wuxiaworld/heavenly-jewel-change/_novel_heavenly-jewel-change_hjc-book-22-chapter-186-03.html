                                            Although I am lying to her now, I will definitely use my actions to pay her
                                            back in the future, treating her just as good as Bing’er and Fei’er. I will
                                            not let her down.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya gave a cold humph and said: “There are many good girls in the
                                            entire world. Furthermore, if you are too much of a playboy, how can you
                                            concentrate on cultivating?! With such a talent like yours, are you going to
                                            waste it just like that? Let me tell you, I will never allow such a thing!
                                            You better keep yourself in check, you’re not allowed to go find other girls
                                            any longer, otherwise don’t blame your Master for teaching you a
                                            lesson.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly nodded his head repeatedly, grinning as he said: “Even
                                            if you asked me to find more girls, I wouldn’t dare! I already have four, if
                                            I add on anymore, I wouldn’t be able to handle anymore! A man’s vigor is
                                            limited after all, and he shouldn’t attempt to go past his own limit!”</p>
                                        <p>“Bullshit, what four. It is five. Don’t forget that little girl that I agreed
                                            to when she helped you in the fusion of your Dragon-Tiger Transformation.
                                            That is the little girl from the Heavenly Demon Sect. Just this five. No
                                            more. Do you hear me?”</p>
                                        <p>“Uhh…” Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but mutter inwardly: Master, you were the
                                            one to say not to add anymore, and you just added one yourself. Of course,
                                            he could not dismiss Little Witch. After all, she had become his Sacrifice
                                            that time, given him her most precious virtue, and he could not just abandon
                                            her like that.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing suddenly had an urge to cry to the skies - It is not this
                                            brother who is philandering, sometimes I am forced as well!</p>
                                        <p>Of course, if he dared to shout it out, if Long Shiya did not beat him until
                                            his teeth dropped out, he would not be the Six Ultimate Heavenly
                                            Emperor!</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing reappeared in the camp, it had already been mostly set up
                                            properly once again. Currently, he had changed into a fresh set of clothing,
                                            and nothing seemed amiss besides a pale complexion. This was not an act;
                                            after all he had lost quite a lot of blood, and even for his physique, it
                                            would take him some time to replenish that blood loss.</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty, what happened to you? Why do you look so off colour?” Tian’er
                                            had waited so long for Zhou Weiqing to return, and she asked
                                            concernedly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, held onto her hands and said: “Don’t worry, it
                                            is nothing. Alright, you go to our tent to wait for me first. It has been a
                                            long time since I have returned, and I will need to hold some meetings with
                                            the Peerless Battalion. To round up our thoughts and discuss about the
                                            future.”</p>
                                        <p>Although Tian’er was still slightly curious, she nodded and returned to the
                                            tent. Even before Zhou Weiqing had ascended the Heavenly Snow Mountain, he
                                            had already captured Tian’er’s heart; but when she actually saw him up the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain fighting for her, he had totally conquered her heart
                                            and soul. Although Tian’er had a wild character, towards Zhou Weiqing she
                                            was mostly gentle and compliant.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing immediately sent an order for the upper echelons of the Peerless
                                            Battalion to gather for a meeting.</p>
                                        <p>Before long, the group of officers who had laboured for half a day had
                                            gathered. Of course, that included Shangguan Xue’er, still disguised as
                                            Shangguan Fei’er.</p>
                                        <p>All of them saw Zhou Weiqing’s pale face, but not many actually sympathized
                                            with him. Who asked him to two-time so obviously?</p>
                                        <p>However, they were all quickly given a big surprise.</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing sat down at the front main seat, Shangguan Xue’er walked
                                            up, a bowl of hot soup in her hands which she placed down in front of him.
                                            Gently, she said: “I’ve made this for you, it will help enrich the blood.
                                            Drink it first, the weather is cold here.”</p>
                                        <p>Everyone else stared with jaws agape, not believing their eyes. All of them
                                            had experienced Shangguan Fei’er’s temper for themselves, and they believed
                                            that seeing Zhou Weiqing bring a woman back, having her not blow up on the
                                            spot was already giving him a lot of face! How could she possibly still cook
                                            soup for him?! Could it be… it was poisoned? A laxative or something
                                            perhaps?</p>
                                        <p>That still didn’t seem right! Looking at their Chief Instructor and her
                                            gentle affection eyes, how could it be poison? What was this magic?!</p>
                                        <p>In an instant, the Drunken Rogue Luo Ke Di, who usually thought of himself as
                                            the greatest playboy, wanted to throw himself at Zhou Weiqing’s feet in
                                            admiration. He thought to himself that when the meeting was over, he would
                                            have to consult Zhou Weiqing to see how he had done it!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, taking the bowl of soup honestly, not even
                                            seizing the chance to touch her hands. Gently, he said: “Thank you.”
                                            Drinking a mouthful of soup, he found it delicious, and a jet of warm energy
                                            flowed into his body, giving him a comfortable feeling. l</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er blushed slightly, and she retreated to the side with her
                                            head down slightly. Seeing Zhou Weiqing ‘come back to life’, her heart was
                                            filled with joy, so much so that she was not even angry about him bringing
                                            back Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>Just like that Zhou Weiqing had told Long Shiya, if he had not acted
                                            previously, there was no possible way that they could have resolved the
                                            issue today. Yet somehow, he had successfully passed through that ordeal,
                                            and the irreconcilable issues had been reconciled.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing turned to the others and saw the disbelief in their eyes, and he
                                            couldn’t help but reveal a hint of smugness.</p>
                                        <p>“Master Hua Feng, these few weeks it’s been a great trouble for you. I still
                                            do not know what our Peerless Battalion have accomplished during this border
                                            wars, and the state of the Northwest Army currently.”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng said: “To our Peerless Battalion, the state is extremely good.” He
                                            then described to Zhou Weiqing all that had happened during the war, how the
                                            Peerless Battalion had helped save the day for the Northwest Army, and the
                                            status they had gained as a result.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his account, Zhou Weiqing kept nodding all the way. The current
                                            development had already far surpassed all his previous expectations and
                                            plans, and it was without question that the current Peerless Battalion had
                                            been forged into a formidable fighting force.</p>
                                        <p>At last, Hua Feng summarised: “At this current moment, our Peerless Battalion
                                            has already official gone through the baptism of war. Besides close combat
                                            experience, which has been relatively lesser, they are now very experienced
                                            in all other forms of combat. As for the the Northwest Army, or even the
                                            ZhongTian Army Headquarters, they wish for us to change formations to become
                                            a Legion, even offering to supplement with elite troops to form a Peerless
                                            Legion, to become the strongest Legion in the northern borders to face the
                                            WanShou Empire in the future. Battalion Commander, this decision is up to
                                            you.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly but he shook his head and said: “That is not
                                            possible. If we truly become a Peerless Legion, then we would not be able to
                                            leave this place. How could we leave the ZhongTian Empire in the future
                                            then, or break away from their control?”</p>
                                        <p>“As you all know, originally I chose the Ruffian Battalion to begin my
                                            development was for very simple reasons. Firstly, ruffian soldiers would be
                                            more easily enticed by money and other benefits. Secondly, to be able to
                                            become ruffian soldiers, they must have some degree of strength, power or
                                            other abilities. As long as I could bring them together as a proper team,
                                            their combat prowess would be something to be reckoned with. Perhaps more
                                            importantly, these ruffian soldiers have already gone through hell and back,
                                            faced with possible death all the time, and they would cherish their lives
                                            even more, knowing to treasure a last possible chance. Also, the fact that
                                            they were exiled to the Ruffian Battalion meant that they did not have any
                                            other backgrounds or connections. On the surface, they might be a bunch of
                                            useless ruffians, but the truth is they are the purest unit in the army, at
                                            least in my eyes. That was the reason why I chose the Ruffian
                                            Battalion.”</p>
                                        <p>“However, if our Peerless Battalion turns into the Peerless Legion, then the
                                            first problem we face is how will be leave in the future? An entire Legion
                                            sounds very powerful, very tempting, but those new elites, how could they
                                            not have their own background and old leaders? More importantly, they would
                                            have families in the ZhongTian Empire. At this point, I will not hide
                                            anything from anyone, though most of you should know this already. I am from
                                            the Heavenly Bow Empire, and my homeland has been destroyed by the Kalise
                                            Empire and Bai Da Empire. The reason I set up the Peerless Battalion was to
                                            eventually return to my homeland, to chase off the invaders. You all will be
                                            my future officers of merit who restored the homeland. As such, I would
                                            ignore all the suggestions of the ZhongTian Empire.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, those who already knew about this were
                                            impassive, but most of the newer Main Company Leaders were surprised.
                                            Leaving the ZhongTian Empire? However, just like what Zhou Weiqing had said,
                                            most of these ruffian soldiers did not have any connections or kin in the
                                            ZhongTian Empire, and thus after a short period of surprise, they were able
                                            to accept it with no problems.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said solemnly: “In the near future, we will be continuing our
                                            training and integration of our entire Battalion, as well as completely
                                            outfitting all our troops. Once this is done, we will leave for the Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire.”</p>
                                        <p>One of the Main Company Leaders couldn’t help but ask: “Battalion Commander,
                                            it is fine on our end, but will the Northwest Army actually let us
                                            leave?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “I have my own ways regarding this matter, so
                                            you all do not need to worry about it. Also, in this period of time, we do
                                            not need to worry that the WanShou Empire will launch any attack. Alright,
                                            Bro Lin, what is the current status of outfitting our troops currently?”</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo stepped forward. It had been a few months since they had seen each
                                            other, and he looked even more stable and composed now, clearly his
                                            cultivation level had also improved.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, when Long Shiya was in the camp and had nothing to do, he would
                                            give some pointers to these Peerless Battalion officers. Amongst them, the
                                            one that Long Shiya placed most importance on was actually Lin TianAo,
                                            giving him several tips on his Assembly Shield Set, how to control and wield
                                            it in battle, and Lin TianAo had definitely benefited greatly from it.</p>
                                        <p>“Currently, the outfitting of our Heavenly Bow Unit is already at the later
                                            stages. Of our five thousand archer troops, all of them are already geared
                                            fully in the titanium mail. Those that sustained any damage in the war are
                                            currently being repaired, otherwise that is considered completed. We have
                                            also recruited around a hundred blacksmiths into our Peerless Battalion to
                                            join our logistics team, fully focused on repairs and crafting any spare
                                            equipment we need.”</p>
                                        <p>“As for the Gold Crow and Berserker Tribes, for their Heavy Cavalry equipment
                                            the first batch of five hundred sets have already arrived. Although the
                                            equipment is extremely expensive, it is truly worth it. The remaining one
                                            thousand five hundred sets should arrive within the next half year, even
                                            including the armour for their mounts. Currently, their two Main Companies
                                            of a thousand soldiers each already have their own Unicorn Heavenly Beast
                                            steeds, even their own reserve troops have their own Unicorn Heavenly
                                            Beasts. In fact, Battalion Commander, you are back just in the right time. I
                                            needed to ask you if we are going to gear their reserve troops as well?”</p>
                                        <p>Without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing said: “Of course, we must gear them as well.
                                            These are all to protect our lives on the battlefield. Every chance that
                                            increases our troops survival on the battlefield, we do not need to save
                                            money on that. Bro Lin, this matter I shall leave it to you. I don’t care
                                            how you increase the order amount, but within half a year, I don’t just want
                                            to see that one thousand five hundred sets, but three thousand five hundred
                                            sets. By that time, we will be leaving, so I want everything to be settled
                                            by then. What about our Consolidated Equipment?”</p>
