                                            tears were falling down.</p>
                                        <p>How could Zhou Weiqing possibly dare to let him kneel and kowtow towards
                                            himself! He quickly knelt down first, grabbing hold of Duan Tianlang’s
                                            waist, preventing him from kneeling down.</p>
                                        <p>“Senior Uncle, please don’t do that, I would not be able to take it! I’ll
                                            show it to you…” Zhou Weiqing said hurriedly.</p>
                                        <p>By this point, he could no longer care about conning Duan Tianlang, even
                                            feeling ashamed about wanting to do so. He could clearly tell that this
                                            Senior Uncle in front of him truly wanted the ‘Hate Ground no Set’ design so
                                            much that he was even willing to give his life for it, truly showing how
                                            much Consolidating Equipment Scrolls were to him. Towards powerhouses like
                                            him, sometimes their fame, reputation and face was even more important their
                                            lives, yet he was willing to kneel and kowtow to a junior like him. Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s heartstrings had indeed been tugged. Asking himself inwardly, he
                                            knew that he might not have such a stubborn love towards something.</p>
                                        <p>With that sense of respect, he agreed to show the legendary set design.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Duan Tianlang did not reveal any sense of
                                            delight. Instead, his body seemed to waver, his eyes rolling as he entered a
                                            trancelike state.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya instantly saw that something was wrong, and in a flash he appeared
                                            behind Duan Tianlang’s back, pressing his palms to his back, a serious look
                                            on his face. An overwhelming Heavenly Energy was drawn in from all sides,
                                            surging into Duan Tianlang as Long Shiya slapped out with his palms
                                            consecutively, striking over a hundred palms onto Duan Tianlang’s back.</p>
                                        <p>These few years, because Duan Tianlang did not feel like there was anything
                                            left to live for, he had not controlled or taken care of his body, and his
                                            life force was almost empty. This was also the reason why his Long Shiya had
                                            taken so long to return; when he had found Duan Tianlang, he was on the
                                            verge of dying, and he had used his powerful Heavenly Energy to renourish
                                            Duan Tianlang’s body, dragging him back from the verge of death before
                                            bringing him back here. Of course, it was also because of the ‘Hate Ground
                                            no Handle’ set, otherwise Duan Tianlang might not have accepted Long Shiya’s
                                            aid. Sometimes, living a long time may not be something to be happy about.
                                            Previously, after he had helped Long Shiya complete the entire set of ‘Hate
                                            Sky no Handle, he no longer had any goals or targets to live for. In terms
                                            of creativity and design, he knew inwardly that he could not surpass his
                                            forefathers, and the only thing he could still think of was the ‘Hate Ground
                                            no Handle’ Legendary Set.</p>
                                        <p>This was the first time Zhou Weiqing had experienced a Heavenly Emperor’s
                                            power first hand, and as Long Shiya manipulated the Heavenly Energy, he felt
                                            as if the entire atmosphere was like a massive Devour Whirlwind, with Long
                                            Shiya as the center, everything surging towards him. Yet, this was not
                                            Devouring, but some sort of draw or attraction, as if in that instant the
                                            entire world was in his grasp.</p>
                                        <p>The hazed eyes of Duan Tianlang seemed to slowly recover as light began to
                                            return to them, and a faint white light rose from his skin. He slowly drew a
                                            deep breath, as long as whale whistling, drawing the immense Heavenly Energy
                                            that Long Shiya had drawn in into his own body before expelling his breath.
                                            Zhou Weiqing could faintly see that the breath he expelled out was a greyish
                                            colour.</p>
                                        <p>With a new lease of life breathed into Duan Tianlang, Long Shiya slowly put
                                            his hands down. “Old friend, don’t scare me like that. I spent so much
                                            effort to drag you back from the verge of death earlier, if you were to die
                                            now, could you be satisfied? The ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ design you’ve
                                            always hoped for is now in front of you!”</p>
                                        <p>Duan Tianlang looked at Long Shiya, however his eyes did not have gratitude
                                            but a mild chagrin. “It’s all you old thing, if you didn’t drag me back from
                                            the brink, would I know about the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set?
                                            Perhaps, I would already be reunited with your sister in law. Now, I’ll have
                                            to stay alive a few more years at least. Don’t worry, I will take care now.
                                            As long as I don’t want to die, even if hell tries to reach up and grab me,
                                            it won’t be that easy.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing took out the stack of designs and brought it in front of Duan
                                            Tianlang respectfully. He trusted Long Shiya, and also believed that the
                                            story he had told was indeed true. However, he did not take out all the
                                            designs, just nine of the pieces. He might respect Duan Tianlang and trust
                                            in his teacher, but without Huyan Aobo’s agreement he would not show
                                            everything.”</p>
                                        <p>“Senior Uncle, this is nine out of ten pieces of the entire ‘Hate Ground no
                                            Handle’ Legendary Set design. I’m sorry, as I have not gotten permission
                                            from my Legacy of Strength teacher, I cannot let you see them all now. Once
                                            I meet up with Master Huyan again and get his permission, I will pass you
                                            the last design piece to see.”</p>
                                        <p>Duan Tianlang nodded silently, his hands trembling as he took the nine design
                                            sheets from Zhou Weiqing’s hands, his eyes reddening.</p>
                                        <p>“How many years has it been… more than a thousand years…Hate Sky no Handle…
                                            Hate Ground no Handle… finally they reunite. Thank you Weiqing, you have
                                            truly fully fulfilled this last wish of your Senior Uncle. I am already so
                                            old, but I have gathered much over all these long years. The materials
                                            required for the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set is not that much different from
                                            that of the ‘Hate Sky no Handle’ Legendary Set, and I will try to complete
                                            this set for you. I only hope that the heavens grant this old man enough
                                            time to succeed… once I can see you wear the full set of the ‘Hate Ground no
                                            Handle’, then I can truly die in peace.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, Zhou Weiqing was overjoyed. This meant he would have a God
                                            Tier Consolidating Equipment Master by his side specially helping him to
                                            create his Legendary Set!</p>
                                        <p>Before Long Shiya could even remind him, Zhou Weiqing had knelt down on the
                                            ground with a soft thud, kowtowing three times towards Duan Tianlang, who
                                            smiled faintly as he accepted the obeisance.</p>
                                        <p>“Child, I accept your obeisance not because of your thanks. The Legacy of
                                            Strength has been split apart for far too long, and as the Sixty First Sect
                                            Leader of the main branch Legacy of Strength, I ask that you return to the
                                            main branch, to reunite both branches and form a whole and complete Legacy
                                            of Strength.”</p>
                                        <p>“Oei, oei, Old Duan, one must be honest and virtuous.” Upon hearing his
                                            words, Long Shiya immediately exclaimed anxiously. To him, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            even more important than a wife, and he was afraid that his precious
                                            disciple was about to be snatched away from him.”</p>
                                        <p>Duan Tianlang gave a soft smile and said: “Alright, Fatty Long, don’t give me
                                            that. Would I really steal your disciple? However, you also have to admit
                                            that Weiqing is part of my Legacy of Strength right? Although I am not
                                            taking him as an official disciple, I will still pass down all my knowledge
                                            as a Consolidating Equipment Master. Whether or not he has the time and
                                            energy to learn it, that will be his business.”</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya stared at him with jaw agape before saying: “Old Duan, when have
                                            you become so shameless?”</p>
                                        <p>Duan Tianlang laughed heartily, carefully keeping the designs in his hands.
                                            “What do you mean shameless? I am teaching him everything I know, whether or
                                            not he chooses to master it is his business, how is it shameless? I can’t be
                                            bothered about you old thing. Okay, Weiqing, come help your Senior Uncle
                                            find a place to rest. I must take a bath and burn incense [1. Literal
                                            translation, basically a ‘ritual’ to prepare oneself] in preparation first
                                            before I take a good look at the brilliance of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’.”
                                            As he spoke up to that point, his eyes gleamed with a brilliance, the sudden
                                            burst of aura no lesser than Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly pulled his Single-Horned Ghost Demon Horse from the
                                            side, letting Long Shiya and Duan Tianlang mount it. Although Long Shiya was
                                            extremely large, Zhou Weiqing’s Ghost Demon Horse was truly a magnificent
                                            steed, and had no problems carrying both of them. He himself followed by the
                                            side of his Ghost Demon Horse, circulating his Heavenly Energy as they
                                            headed towards the direction the Peerless Battalion had left.</p>
                                        <p>Due to the speed of the horse carts with all their gear, the Peerless
                                            Battalion was travelling at a much slower pace. Before long, Zhou Weiqing
                                            and his two teachers had caught up with the main group. Naturally, at that
                                            point, someone let him have a Ghost Demon Horse to mount on as well; as the
                                            Battalion Commander, it wouldn’t do for Zhou Weiqing to be running all the
                                            way along.</p>
                                        <p>As for Long Shiya and Duan Tianlang, they naturally drew many curious gazes.
                                            Riding on the Ghost Demon Horse, Long Shiya appeared drowsy and about to
                                            fall asleep, while Duan Tianlang looked to be deep in thought, neither of
                                            them seeming to care about anything happening around them.</p>
                                        <p>It did not take the entire troop long to reach close to the front of the
                                            northern army encampment. Of course, with so many gathered at once, they
                                            were stopped by the patrols, and Zhou Weiqing took out the plaque that Shen
                                            Ji had given him to get the patrolling soldiers to report back. In a jiffy,
                                            a group of riders could be seen coming from the Seventh Legion.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the Peerless Battalion soldiers had already kept all their
                                            titanium alloy mail, and were only dressed in their army uniforms. Zhou
                                            Weiqing did not want to reveal all his secrets so easily, especially such
                                            expensive equipment… even in the entire ZhongTian Empire, not a single army
                                            unit could be as well geared as the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>The one in front of the incoming riders was familiar to him, though her
                                            facial expression was not kind. It was the Regiment Commander Shen Bu, with
                                            her sister Shen Yi by her side. For the two sisters to see Zhou Weiqing, how
                                            could their expressions be nice. If not for Shen Ji giving them strict
                                            orders, they probably wished they could beat Zhou Weiqing up.</p>
                                        <p>“Ohh, isn’t this Regiment Commander Shen Bu? How do you do, how do you do,
                                            how could I trouble you to come all the way to receive us?” Seeing Shen Bu,
                                            Zhou Weiqing felt rather amused, knowing that the enmity between them would
                                            not be so easily resolved.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu dismounted, heading towards Zhou Weiqing as she said coldly: “I have
                                            orders from Seventh Legion, Legion Commander Shen Ji to receive Battalion
                                            Commander Zhou. He has given the order that your First Special Battalion
                                            will camp right beside my Sixteenth Regiment. The space has already been
                                            cleared for you, and you all can head there to set up your camp.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave her a salute with palm in hand and said: “Thank you very
                                            much.”</p>
                                        <p>Although his words were of thanks, his expression was rather indifferent.
                                            Shen Bu already knew that they had changed names to the Peerless Battalion,
                                            yet she had emphasized the old name of First Special Battalion, clearly
                                            mocking them about still being the Ruffian Battalion, and Zhou Weiqing did
                                            not see the need to give her a good expression in return.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu turned her horse around and said: “Alright, then follow me. Battalion
                                            Commander Zhou, I do need to remind you that this is the main northern army
                                            encampment. Please keep your soldiers in check, otherwise the military
                                            criminal code will still have to come in effect.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Do not worry about that Regiment
                                            Commander Shen Bu, as long as the female soldiers from your Sixteenth
                                            Regiment do not come looking for men here, our Peerless Battalion soldiers
                                            will behave themselves!”</p>
                                        <p>His voice was not soft, and laughter instantly erupted around him. These
                                            ruffian soldiers of the Peerless Battalion had camped in the north, climbing
                                            their way through the threat of death, and they would not be afraid of
                                            anyone.</p>
                                        <p>“You!” Shen Yi was about to have a fit of anger, but she was quickly
                                            restrained by Shen Bu, who turned to glare coldly at Zhou Weiqing before
                                            mounting up and heading towards the main camp.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Battalion was situated right between the Sixteenth and
                                            Seventeenth Regiments, and it was clear that the area had been specially
                                            cleared out for them. However, though the area had been cleared out, there
                                            was still much rubbish there. Although there was no smell due to the bitter
                                            winter cold, it was still an uncomfortable thing to look at.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu acted like she did not see all the rubbish, saying impassively to
                                            Zhou Weiqing: “Please camp here Battalion Zhou, I will be heading off
                                            then.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was still smiling as he said: “Alright then, Regiment Commander
                                            Shen Bu, I shall not send you off then.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu ignored him, leading Shen Yi and her personal guards to turn and
                                            leave.</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, what do we do?” Wei Feng sidled closer to Zhou Weiqing and asked.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said calmly: “Do you still need to ask? This is an army camp,
                                            not a rubbish dump. Whoever these belong to, just throw it back to
                                            them.”</p>
                                        <p></p>
