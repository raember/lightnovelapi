                                            grudge against her, and it was just a fight for the rental of a house. How
                                            could be possibly kill someone for that? Furthermore, this was the Fei Li
                                            City, where he was not even a citizen and had no backing. On the other hand,
                                            Ming Hua and her brother were obviously of some status in the Fei Li City,
                                            and Zhou Weiqing did not want to bring trouble to himself. He had already
                                            paid his school fees, and intended to learn all he could!</p>
                                        <p>“Oei… wake up. Get rid of these flowers.” Zhou Weiqing lifted up his right
                                            hammer, prodding Ming Hua on her head, causing a soft *peng* sound. Although
                                            he did not use any strength, it still caused her to shake around. With a
                                            pained cry, she opened up her eyes, look up at Zhou Weiqing in confusion.
                                            “I… I’m not dead?” Her first action was to quickly touch her head, her head
                                            which she thought would have been smashed into smithereens.</p>
                                        <p>Besides her forehead, which had just been nudged by the hammer and was
                                            hurting a little, her head was still totally fine, with nary a sign of
                                            damage.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua blinked her eyes, the narrow escape from death causing her emotions
                                            to go out of control. “You bastard! You almost killed me!”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing was shocked by her outcry, yelling back in anger. “I, Your
                                            Father, did not kill you. Shouldn’t you be happy and excited? What are you
                                            yelling about?!”</p>
                                        <p>A flash of green light appeared, and most of Ming Hua’s more serious wounds
                                            vanished. She vaulted back, keeping her distance from Zhou Weiqing. At the
                                            same time, a red light flashed in her eyes, and Zhou Weiqing felt as if the
                                            areas he had been struck with by the Hades’ Flower change suddenly.</p>
                                        <p>A large suction force was suddenly applied by the seven Hades’ Flower, and
                                            Zhou Weiqing felt his blood and Heavenly Energy being drawn into them.</p>
                                        <p>The Hades’ Flower were Ming Hua’s strongest skill, how could they be just as
                                            simple as a normal hit. Indeed, even Zhou Weiqing’s Immortal Deity Shield
                                            was not sufficient to block them from piercing him earlier.</p>
                                        <p>Blood sucking combined with the power to absorb Heavenly Energy! Zhou Weiqing
                                            was taken aback, trying to use the hammers in his hands to strike away the
                                            Hades’ Flowers on him. However, to his shock, he found that the hammers both
                                            passed right through the Hades’ Flowers, as if they were illusory and
                                            without an actual body! No wonder they hadn’t been shattered into pieces
                                            when they had been struck by his hammers earlier!</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua said coldly: “Don’t waste your effort. To be struck by my Hades’
                                            Flower, even if it is just one, it will cause your sustained combat ability
                                            to drop, let alone you being hit by so many. Under my control, they will
                                            draw out all your blood and Heavenly Energy, your life and energy
                                            replenishing mine. This is the true power of the Flower of Hades’
                                            Underworld. Amongst all the possible Personal Plants of Life Attribute
                                            Heavenly Jewel Masters, the Hades’ Flower ranks in the top three!</p>
                                        <p>Just as she said that, Ming Hua suddenly noticed that the expression on Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s face was extremely weird. At the same time, a small, white little
                                            head squirmed out from his bosom, a blue ‘King’ word on its cute little
                                            head. Wasn’t that our dear little white tiger, Fat Cat?</p>
                                        <p>It seemed like Fat Cat understood what Ming Hua had said, and its deep purple
                                            eyes revealed a look of disdain and scorn. Opening its little mouth, it
                                            seemed to give a little cheh sound, before it squirmed back into Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s bosom and went back to sleep.</p>
                                        <p>By now, Shangguan Bing’er had opened her eyes once more. Seeing that Ming Hua
                                            was alright, she was both relieved and shocked. However, her guard rose once
                                            more. From her perspective, she wasn’t thinking about Zhou Weiqing pulling
                                            his punches, but that Ming Hua having some unique skill that allowed her to
                                            dodge the blow in the last second. After all, the power that Ming Hua had
                                            displayed was indeed not something to be trifled with.</p>
                                        <p>The Hades’ Flowers which were currently sucking Zhou Weiqing’s blood and
                                            Heavenly Energy was turning a brighter, fresher red. However, in the next
                                            instant, Ming Hua started in shock.</p>
                                        <p>By now, Ming Hua had just recovered from the terror of death. She knew that
                                            the reason why she was alive was because Zhou Weiqing had shown mercy and
                                            not dealt the final blow. However, with her pride, she could not accept such
                                            an ending. Since her Hades’ Flower had already launched the attack, she
                                            wanted to teach him a lesson and get back some face. Just as she was
                                            thinking if she should stop the attack, she suddenly felt a sense of terror
                                            that even overshadowed the fear of death earlier.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyes turned bloodshot. From his perspective, the attribute
                                            wheel had uncontrollably spun to the grey area which he was unable to
                                            master. The next moment, the sensation of his life energy flowing out
                                            stopped, instead a strong suction force welling up from within his body. The
                                            Hades’ Flowers, which had just a second ago been draining him of his life
                                            blood and Heavenly Energy, were now being drained of their energies! The
                                            tables had turned somehow, and at a crazy rate that was several times that
                                            of the Hades’ Flowers’ absorption earlier. The Hades’ Flowers were still red
                                            in colour, but they were now stained with a strange, demonically evil
                                            looking red.</p>
                                        <p>“Aaahhhh!!” Ming Hua cried out in fear and shock as her body crumpled onto
                                            the ground weakly. The Hades’ Flowers were her Personal Plant, and were
                                            intricately linked to her life force. Zhou Weiqing Devouring their life
                                            energies was naturally also doing so to her life energy and Heavenly Energy.
                                            She had originally already been injured, and much of her Heavenly Energy was
                                            used up. Now that she was being Devoured, she felt a sense of weakness
                                            overcome her and fell to the ground.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing had been given a big shock by the sudden change as
                                            well, almost scaring himself. However, in the next moment, he recovered and
                                            laughed out gleefully: “Heh heh. Tsk, trying to drain me? Looks like I’m
                                            your nemesis! Haha!”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua’s face grew paler every second, while Zhou Weiqing felt his energy
                                            and spirit improving, as his Heavenly Energy recovered rapidly.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua bit her lip hard, forcing her mouth shut. Although her heart was
                                            filled with shock and fear, she refused to let herself beg for her life. She
                                            had never in her wildest imagination dreamed that her Hades’ Flowers’
                                            greatest power could be turned against her so easily. She couldn’t imagine
                                            what would happen if all her Hades’ Flower had actually struck Zhou Weiqing…
                                            Would she be drained dry in an instant?</p>
                                        <p>“Little Fatty, stop! She is going to die if you continue!” Shangguan Bing’er
                                            suddenly appeared beside Zhou Weiqing and said gently.</p>
                                        <p>“Oh, of course I must listen to my Lady wife!” Upon hearing her words, Zhou
                                            Weiqing agreed. Focusing all his might onto the attribute wheel, he
                                            forcefully moved it back to the silver region, ending the Devouring. The
                                            Hades’ Flowers which had been on his body fell to the ground, vanishing into
                                            nothingness.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua lay on the ground, panting hard as she heaved a sigh of relief. She
                                            struggled to get up, but found she had no strength left in her body, and
                                            could only manage to struggle into a seated position, gasping for
                                            breath.</p>
                                        <p>In another flash of dark gold light, the twin hammers in Zhou Weiqing’s hands
                                            disappeared.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, the secret of the twin hammers was in the line - ‘Good and evil,
                                            illusion and truth.’ Although they seemed to be a pair of hammers, it was
                                            actually one real and one fake hammer! The fake one was able to draw
                                            attention and trick enemies, while the real one held unbelievable power.
                                            Without question, the fake one signified ‘good’, while the real one
                                            signified ‘evil’. The mix of truth and illusion made it easy to trick and
                                            fool enemies, which could hold destructive end results for them. Take for
                                            example, if you were striking with all your might to block a seemingly
                                            powerful blow, and it turned out to be fake, it would cause a loss of
                                            balance and an overextension of strength - which could easily lead to
                                            defeat. More importantly, Zhou Weiqing could switch the false and real
                                            hammers at will! Adding that to the fact that he could make use of them to
                                            unleash any of his skills without socketing them, and at a higher level,
                                            this was indeed an impressive weapon. Indeed, it was because of this God
                                            Tier weapon that Zhou Weiqing had been able to defeat Ming Hua, who was of a
                                            higher cultivation level than he was.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing extended his arm to hug Shangguan Bing’er, turning towards Ming
                                            Hua with a lecherous look on his face as he said: “Beauty, you are lucky
                                            that my wife is so kind hearted. If it was just me, I’d have finished you
                                            off! Hmph. There’s no need for me to send you off right, please leave
                                            now.”</p>
                                        <p>By now, Ming Hua had already recovered a little. Zhou Weiqing had Devoured
                                            quite a bit of her Heavenly Energy and life force, and had recovered to
                                            nearly the state he had been before the battle. She, on the other hand, was
                                            still feeling weak, with less than ten percent of her energy remaining. If
                                            not for the fact that she was of the Life Attribute which managed to heal
                                            her injuries, she might have sustained some critical wounds.</p>
                                        <p>“No.” Ming Hua gave a humph and sat down on the floor, saying to Shangguan
                                            Bing’er: “If you all try to throw me out forcefully, I’ll yell molest!
                                            Furthermore, I will latch onto your man from now on! No matter what tactics,
                                            I will snatch him away from you! If you don’t believe me, you can give it a
                                            try.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stared at Ming Hua, his jaw dropping. “Oei, this beauty over
                                            there, you are really a piece of work. You should honour your bets, earlier
                                            you said whoever wins the fight gets the house, you have lost so you should
                                            leave.”</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua suddenly burst out laughing. “Who can prove that we placed a bet? Do
                                            we have it in writing? Do we have witnesses? Any documentations? Nothing
                                            right? Furthermore, how can you, a man, bully a weak woman like me? Aren’t
                                            you ashamed of yourself?”</p>
                                        <p>“You… weak… woman??!” Zhou Weiqing was speechless, looking into the heavens.
                                            Earlier, he had fought with all his might, forced to bring out everything he
                                            had in order to beat her, even his Legendary Consolidated Equipment Set
                                            hammers, or he would have lost a long time ago! As for some of the newer
                                            Stored Skills, it wasn’t that he was trying to hide them, but he just wasn’t
                                            practiced in using them yet, and thus their effect would definitely not be
                                            comparable to the skills he had been using all along! Under such a
                                            circumstance, he had still almost lost to Ming Hua, and he was still feeling
                                            rather nervous from the tough fight. This woman was indeed too dangerous!
                                            Unexpectedly… she had just said… she was a weak woman?! He was rendered
                                            speechless.</p>
                                        <p>Ming Hua recovered some of her vigor, and managed to stand back up. Looking
                                            around the house, she smiled faintly and pointed to one of the smaller
                                            rooms. “I’ll be kind and not chase you both out. I’ll just stay in that
                                            room, and we can share the rent of the house. Let’s each take a step back.
                                            Who asked me to be older than you both, I will let you both have the
                                            advantage.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing had the urge to rush forward and throw her out physically. It
                                            was a rare sight to see someone even more shameless than he was! However,
                                            Shangguan Bing’er grabbed his arm and said: “Just let her stay in the
                                            room.”</p>
                                        <p>Although Shangguan Bing’er did not want to let Ming Hua have the room, she
                                            did not dare bet on it. Ming Hua’s threat to her resounded in her mind, and
                                            she dared not test it. After all, she knew our dear Little Fatty’s weakness
                                            to beautiful women… how could he resist such a seductive woman’s
                                            advances!</p>
                                        <p></p>
