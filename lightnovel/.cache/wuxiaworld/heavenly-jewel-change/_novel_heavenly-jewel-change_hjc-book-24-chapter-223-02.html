                                            breakdown. Furthermore, now that he had completed the Dragon-Tiger
                                            Transformation, fully inheriting the powers of both the Solidified Dragon
                                            Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodlines, the toughness and
                                            flexibility of his body was far beyond any Heavenly Jewel Master. As such,
                                            his progress in the Immortal Deity Technique had already long surpassed that
                                            of the creator!</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Early in the morning, the ZhongTian Plaza was already crowded and bustling
                                            with life. The citizens had long since started to gather in the plaza and
                                            the surroundings, some having come the night before to camp out at the plaza
                                            grounds the ensure they had a good place. As long as they did not enter the
                                            central zone, the guards around the plaza would not bother them.</p>
                                        <p>To some of the citizens’ amusement, the freshly rebuilt competition stage
                                            looked very different from that of the preliminary stage. The first and most
                                            obvious change was in the size, at least double that of the previous stage.
                                            Secondly, it was clear that the stage was no longer crafted out of granite,
                                            instead giving off a faint green glow. Some of the people who had knowledge
                                            in this area quickly pointed out it was a green gold stone, a metal several
                                            times harder and tougher than granite. Obviously, that battle on the last
                                            day between the Heavenly Bow Battle Team and the Dan Dun Battle Team had
                                            caused so much destruction that it had left a deep impression on the
                                            organizers, and they were trying to prevent it from happening again. After
                                            all, in the top eight fights, the others notwithstanding, the Heavenly Bow
                                            Battle Team would once again be facing a strong opponent, yet another team
                                            with the background of a Great Saint Lands, the BaoPo Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>The Passion Valley was behind the BaoPo Battle Team, and at least from the
                                            previous rankings, the Passion Valley was above the Blood Red Hell. This top
                                            eight fight was an elimination type match; that was to say, the team members
                                            on the stage would continue fighting until they were beaten, until all of
                                            one side’s members had lost. As such, the competition and degree of fighting
                                            could only be more intense. Of course, once again this fight was the most
                                            anticipated amongst all of the top eight fights.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>“Boss, today we really aren’t going to bet anymore?” Ma Qun asked, a look of
                                            regret on his face.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at him, a look of stern justice on his face as he said
                                            grandly: “One must not be too greedy, we have already won enough.”</p>
                                        <p>The current time was not considered early anymore, with the morning sun
                                            relatively high in the sky.</p>
                                        <p>The immediate surroundings of the stage was also different now. Although
                                            there was no restriction regarding the other teams who had not entered the
                                            top eight, and they would still be able to watch from their rest houses,
                                            there were only eight rest houses closest to the stage, belonging to the top
                                            eight to use. The rest of the teams had their rest houses further
                                            behind.</p>
                                        <p>The Heavenly Bow Battle Team rest house was right next to the ZhongTian
                                            Battle Team’s one, and Zhou Weiqing was definitely very satisfied with that
                                            arrangement. At least, he could now see his two wives at close proximity
                                            easily now. The top eight fight was just as important to him, as this would
                                            be the determining factor whether or not he could ascend the Heavenly JEwel
                                            Island and see Bing’er.</p>
                                        <p>It seemed like just a blink of an eye and three years had just passed like
                                            that. As the saying goes, the closer one was, the more one grew nostalgic
                                            about things. Now that he was on the verge of seeing Bing’er, his heart
                                            yearned for her even more. Towards this point, Tian’er could already sense
                                            it. As long as he was not deep in cultivation, Zhou Weiqing would constantly
                                            be dazed and distracted, his eyes filled with memory and remembrance.
                                            However, Tian’er never interrupted him. In truth, amongst all of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s other women, the one Tian’er could accept the most was actually
                                            Shangguan Bing’er. More than anyone else, she knew how much Bing’er meant to
                                            Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>The ZhongTian Empire officials still had not appeared in the VIP Stands yet,
                                            and as soon as Shangguan Tianxin appeared on the VIP Stand, the entire
                                            audience erupted into cheers of ‘Long Live’, a startling sight indeed.
                                            However, Shangguan Tianxin’s expression was not too good, though why that
                                            was so, only he would know.</p>
                                        <p>In the fight a few days ago, the Demon God Projection that Zhou Weiqing had
                                            revived had caused this ZhongTian Emperor to almost kneel down in obeisance.
                                            Luckily, at that time, no one had really noticed him. However, that feeling
                                            had left a deep impression in Shangguan Tianxin’s psyche.</p>
                                        <p>Amongst the three Shangguan brothers, both Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan
                                            Tianyue placed all of their hearts and mind on cultivation. However, for
                                            Shangguan Tianxin, he had to run the entire Empire, and in terms of
                                            cultivation, he was much more slack in comparison. Of course, with the sheer
                                            amount of precious resources available and the power of the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace techniques, he had still managed to reach the Heavenly King Stage.
                                            However, in terms of both cultivation and fighting capabilities, this
                                            Emperor was definitely no match for his brothers. That day, after
                                            experiencing the power and aura of the Demon God for himself, different
                                            thoughts had sprang up in Shangguan Tianxin’s heart. He finally understood
                                            why both his elder brothers did not wish to be bogged down by the power of
                                            the Emperor. The truth was, when their power had reached a certain point,
                                            titles like Emperor was just a joke.</p>
                                        <p>Seated at the head of the VIP Stand, Shangguan Tianxin’s eyes subconsciously
                                            found the Heavenly Bow Battle Team rest house. Inwardly, he sighed. He had
                                            received news from Shangguan Tianyang yesterday to request that the
                                            ZhongTian Empire fully support the Heavenly Bow Empire’s growth, and to also
                                            help them restrict the Bai Da Empire. At that point, Shangguan Tianxin knew
                                            that his three nieces were likely to be ‘taken advantage’ of by that little
                                            brat Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>On the other side, the Dan Dun Battle Team silently appeared in their rest
                                            house in the back row.</p>
                                        <p>The brothers TianFeng and TianMa were conscious now, but their faces were
                                            still pale and ashen, and they had to be supported by their team members to
                                            even enter the rest house. However, they still insisted on coming to watch.
                                            Shen Little Demon was able to walk on her own, but her face was almost just
                                            as pale as theirs, and it was clear that all three of them had not
                                            recovered. Her expression was extremely complicated indeed.</p>
                                        <p>“Big Bro, the news has already been sent back.” TianMa said softly to
                                            TianFeng.</p>
                                        <p>TianFeng nodded and said: “This is of utmost importance, and it is imperative
                                            that the Hell Master learns of it. Today, let us just keep watch on things
                                            for now, let us see if anyone else has that energy besides Zhou Weiqing and
                                            Tian’er.”</p>
                                        <p>TianMa’s brow furrowed as he asked: “Brother, what do you think that energy
                                            is? How could it possibly be so strong that even our Destruction Attribute
                                            isn’t able to move it? Didn’t Hell Master say that the Destruction Attribute
                                            is the strongest Attribute in the world? Above even the four Saint
                                            Attributes?”</p>
                                        <p>TianFeng said: “I do not know either, brother. Alas, we are unable to test
                                            further. Unless, we can catch that Zhou Weiqing and imprison him, to do
                                            further tests on his Heavenly Energy… only then can we find out.”</p>
                                        <p>A cold smirk crossed TianMa’s face as he said icily: “It looks like our
                                            failure this time may not fully be a bad thing. No matter what, we cannot
                                            let them go. We must catch them back no matter what before we can discuss
                                            anything further.”</p>
                                        <p>TianFeng nodded and said: “Have we communicated with the Elders?”</p>
                                        <p>At the side, Shen Little Demon said: “Yes, communications have already been
                                            established. However, we can only wait for them to leave the city before we
                                            think about taking action. After all, this is still the Heaven’s Expanse
                                            Palace territory.”</p>
                                        <p>“Heaven’s Expanse Palace… hmph!” TianFeng gave a cold humph, as his mind
                                            couldn’t help but think back to the Boundless Infinitium Formation, a cold
                                            look of disdain flashing in his eyes.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Perhaps to ensure the top eight fights proceeded smoothly, the judge for the
                                            fights today would once again be personally assumed by Shangguan
                                            Longyin.</p>
                                        <p>In a manner of speaking, the Fei Li Empire had some decently good luck.
                                            Although they had lost a round in the preliminary matches, they were still
                                            able to ascend to the top eight as the second position of their group.
                                            However, their luck was used up by now, as in the top eight, they would be
                                            facing up against the WanShou Battle Team.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>At last, the fights officially began. As usual, the ZhongTian Battle Team was
                                            the first to start. Perhaps due to the nature of the elimination formation,
                                            this time, Shangguan Fei’er was actually the first to start the fight.</p>
                                        <p>What happened next was pretty much without any suspense. With her powerful
                                            close combat powers and seven-Jeweled cultivation level, within less than an
                                            hour, Shangguan Fei’er had defeated six opponents easily. One versus six,
                                            clinching the first victory of the day, and the ZhongTian Battle Team was
                                            the first to enter the top four.</p>
                                        <p>The second round was the WanShou Battle Team against the Fei Li Battle Team.
                                            Once again, it was another easily predictable fight. The brother and sister
                                            duo of Ye Paopao took turns on the stage one after the other, and each of
                                            them managed a single victory before being knocked out, but the rest of the
                                            team fell just too easily. Still, they managed to save some face with those
                                            two victories.</p>
                                        <p>“At last, it’s our turn.” Zhou Weiqing exercised his limbs as he looked
                                            towards his companions. “Ma Qun, you go first. Xixi, second. Crow, third.
                                            Yun Li, fourth. Today, I will be the fifth. Tian’er, you close up if
                                            necessary.”</p>
                                        <p>Besides Tian’er, the other four showed some surprise on their faces. In their
                                            minds, Zhou Weiqing would be fighting first, taking down as many as he could
                                            to bring victory for the team. They did not think that they would actually
                                            have the opportunity to fight today.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing could naturally see the puzzlement in their eyes, and he laughed
                                            heartily as he said: “This is a great opportunity to gain experience and
                                            train yourselves, do not waste it! The Passion Valley is different from the
                                            Blood Red Hell, as close allies to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the BaoPo
                                            Battle Team members will not easily resort to killing methods. It will be a
                                            good fight and experience for you all, so you all just need to do your best
                                            and see how far you can go.”</p>
                                        <p>As the team leader, Zhou Weiqing would not care about showing off at all.
                                            Furthermore, in truth, Zhou Weiqing never really thought that highly of the
                                            BaoPo Battle Team in terms of this top eight fight.</p>
                                        <p>After all, the greatest strength of the Passion Valley was the teamwork and
                                            unity of their husband wife couple teams. According to Zhou Weiqing’s words,
                                            it was ‘man and woman working together, no matter what they did it would not
                                            be tiring’.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of one versus one, singular combat prowess, it was likely they were
                                            not even a match for the Dan Dun Battle Team members, let alone the brothers
                                            TianFeng and TianMa. Since this top eight elimination fight was all a one
                                            versus one style fight, Zhou Weiqing had absolute confidence that in the
                                            entire Passion Valley, no one could defeat him. As a result, he did not feel
                                            any sense of urgency at all, and felt it was a good opportunity to allow his
                                            companions to gain experience.</p>
                                        <p>With a single bound, Ma Qun leapt up the stage, fully dressed in his Peerless
                                            Heavy Cavalry armour, the pair of massive spiked maces in his hands,
                                            striking an imposing figure indeed.</p>
                                        <p>Perhaps because his form was so tall, grand and imposing, or perhaps because
                                            of his previous performances… as soon as he ascended the stage, the
                                            ZhongTian Plaza audience erupted in cheers.</p>
                                        <p>Towards most of these audience, they were here to watch for the thrill and
                                            enjoyment, to have fun! Fighters like Ma Qun, with such direct styles,
                                            ferocity and pure strength… their fights were usually the most enjoyable to
                                            watch. At least, it would give the audience a sense of blood boiling, hearts
                                            afire, and free of inhibitions. As such, he had actually gained quite a few
                                            fans indeed.</p>
                                        <p>On the Passion Valley side, the opponent who had ascended the stage was a
                                            six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
                                        <p>After both sides introduced themselves, the first fight officially began.</p>
                                        <p>Ma Qun’s appearance and his character was definitely a stark contrast. He
                                            knew very well that against a disciple from a Great Saint Lands, with his
                                            four Jeweled cultivation level, it would be extremely difficult for him to
                                            achieve victory. As such, he had decided to take it slow and steady, in a
                                            ‘seek not to be meritorious but only to avoid blame’ defensive fighting
                                            style.</p>
                                        <p>Although he had a pair of massive spiked maces, the truth was that most of Ma
                                            Qun’s abilities were defensive, and offense was his weakest point. As such,
                                            as soon as the fight started, he maintained a defensive position.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of offense, he might not be the best, but in terms of defense, Ma
                                            Qun was definitely a good hand. After all, he had trained a lot under Lin
                                            TianAo and had even received some pointers from Long Shiya himself. With the
                                            two massive spiked maces, the heavy armour, and his four-Jeweled Assembly
                                            Set Shield and his various Earth Attribute defensive Skills, he was like an
                                            impregnable fortress!</p>
