                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing could faintly hear a cold humph that shook through his soul once
                                            more. In the next instant, a muted explosion, and the entire bright purple
                                            crab vanished instantly in a puff of smoke.</p>
                                        <p>The brothers TianFeng and TianMa, still locked in their embrace, fell limply
                                            to the ground, deeply unconscious, as blood began to leak out of their seven
                                            orifices.</p>
                                        <p>Forcefully unleashing such a powerful destruction Skill, yet failing to kill
                                            or even defeat their enemies… All that was left for them was not just a
                                            simple wound or exhaustion. Even the Destruction Attribute in their bodies
                                            had been totally drained dry, and perhaps within the next few years they
                                            would not be able to recover.</p>
                                        <p>As the terrifying Heavenly Energy reverberation swirled in the sky, a
                                            brilliant light flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes. Taking a deep breath, he
                                            closed his eyes to concentrate on the currently weak large Saint Energy
                                            whirlpool, working together with Tian’er to spin it and recoiver. At least,
                                            they were still standing.</p>
                                        <p>This fight could be said to be a total lack of fighting skills at all, and
                                            the final victory had been determined by a single clash between their ace
                                            skills. However, it was without question that this clash of their powerful
                                            Skills had almost brought destruction and ruin to the entire ZhongTian City.
                                            Perhaps the Heavenly Energy inherent within the two Skills was not
                                            considered extremely high, at least not sufficient to bring shock to
                                            Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue. However, the ideological stage at
                                            which they were at was just too terrifying, unbelievable. It was at the true
                                            Heavenly God stage, or even higher!</p>
                                        <p>For the brothers Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue to rush here
                                            personally, it was not just to protect the ZhongTian citizens, but also to
                                            feel for themselves this stage.. This was a stage that they had been
                                            yearning for all their lives, working towards all this time, and this
                                            sensation was of utmost importance to them. If they were lucky, perhaps with
                                            this sensation, it could give them enough understanding to breakthrough once
                                            more. Especially for Shangguan Tianyang, as any breakthrough would mean
                                            reaching the Heavenly God Stage.</p>
                                        <p>The Demon God behind Zhou Weiqing’s back did not vanish instantly after
                                            unleashing its attack. Raising its head slowly, his eyes still closed, his
                                            Will shot towards the skies.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang was personally managing the Boundless Infinitium
                                            Formation, and he instantly shouted out loud without hesitation: “Release
                                            the formation!”</p>
                                        <p>The milky white shield of light instantly dissipated as all forty nine
                                            powerhouses swiftly withdrew their Heavenly Energy. As the ones who released
                                            the formation, they could vaguely sense the terrifying presence and aura of
                                            the Demon God.</p>
                                        <p>As the Boundless Infinitium Formation vanished, the projection of the Demon
                                            God behind Zhou Weiqing also vanished, as if it never had the intention to
                                            attack the formation in the first place.</p>
                                        <p>However, Shangguan Tianyang’s back was already soaked in cold sweat. He could
                                            clearly sense that if he did not give the order to take down the formation
                                            in time, allowing the wisp of that Will of the Demon God to leave, perhaps
                                            it would have drawn in the true Will of the Demon God to descend upon them.
                                            If that truly happened, perhaps everyone in the entire area would have
                                            perished.</p>
                                        <p>Whether or not the Demon God truly existed or not, no one dared to bet on it.
                                            However, even if it was just a gathered consciousness from all of the
                                            Demonic Attribute energy in the world, it was not something that humans
                                            could easily block.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue’s sensations were not as direct or clear as Shangguan
                                            Tianyang, but he still vaguely sensed something.</p>
                                        <p>“Big bro, that aura… that sensation, are there really gods in this world?
                                            Heavenly God Stage…?”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang sighed and shook his head, saying: “Heavenly God Stage…
                                            that is just a name, an estimation on our part. In the legends, only when we
                                            breakthrough the Heavenly God stage, then can we shatter the chains of this
                                            world, entering a whole different realm. That is the legendary Heavenly
                                            Transformation. Only those who have the power of Heavenly Transformation can
                                            truly be called Gods. Zhou Weiqing, that little brat, he actually managed to
                                            use that Saint Energy to summon a bit of a will of the Demon God here…
                                            luckily his cultivation level is insufficient… otherwise, today might not
                                            have ended well at all.”</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyue’s heart was also twisting inside, especially as he looked
                                            at the massive chasm below them. Seeing Zhou Weiqing holding Tian’er’s hands
                                            so intimately, as a father, he was even more dissatisfied. However, at this
                                            point, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace clearly could not reveal too many
                                            things.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Tianyang waved his hands, and the forty nine figures rose into the
                                            air, flying up back towards the Heavenly Jewel Island. Of course, only the
                                            powerhouses that belonged directly to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace like them
                                            could fly to the Heavenly Jewel Island like that.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, the citizens were no longer cheering. In truth, for this huge
                                            battle, in their eyes, they could not have too many feelings, nor could they
                                            understand the underlying profound meanings behind it. To them, it was just
                                            a huge grey figure pointing at a large purple crab, and everything had
                                            ended. The pressure was terrifying, but without a baseline understanding,
                                            any pressure from a powerhouse would seem the same to them. If not for the
                                            fact that the brothers TianFeng and TianMa crumpling to the ground
                                            unconscious and not knowing if they were still alive, perhaps some of the
                                            audience might even think this was a joke fight, an empty show of
                                            strength.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing drew a deep breath, feeling the over-twenty energy whirlpools of
                                            his Death Acupuncture Points spin at full speed. Only when his Heavenly
                                            Energy had recovered to full did he relax slightly. For him, he was no
                                            better than Shangguan Tianyang, his entire clothes soaked in sweat after all
                                            that happened just now.</p>
                                        <p>He made a decision inwardly… no matter what happened, he would never attempt
                                            to summon this Demon God easily again. It was just too abnormal, too
                                            frightening… not a power that he could control at all. He clearly sensed
                                            that the reason why the Demon God Projection actually helped him to destroy
                                            the giant crab was not because of his orders. He did not have the power or
                                            right to order the Demon God. However, it was the provocation of the giant
                                            crab that caused the Demon God Projection to act as he wished, destroying
                                            the crab.</p>
                                        <p>Still covered in a faint, flickering light, Zhou Weiqing’s face finally
                                            relaxed in a relieved expression.</p>
                                        <p>Tian’er looked towards Zhou Weiqing, her eyes gleaming brightly. Her feelings
                                            were different from Zhou Weiqing; after all, the Skill was not unleashed by
                                            her, and all she did was to support him and infuse the Saint Energy into
                                            him. Although she could still sense the sheer terrifying power of the Demon
                                            God, Tian’er understood that by sensing the advanced state of that Will of
                                            the Demon God, it was definitely of immense benefit to their future
                                            breakthrough.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, Tian’er’s heart was full of pride, as it was her man who had
                                            unleashed that terrifying power just now. Zhou Weiqing had been her own
                                            choice, a man who would not be any weaker or less accomplished than her
                                            father in the future. She was truly proud of her own man.</p>
                                        <p>“Senior Shangguan? Where are you?” Zhou Weiqing looked around in
                                            puzzlement.</p>
                                        <p>As if hearing his voice, a figure appeared in a flash hovering over the
                                            chasm. It was Shangguan Longyin. At this moment, the head judge of the
                                            Heavenly Jewel Tournament was truly speechless. Everything that had happened
                                            was far beyond any of their expectations, any of their imaginations, and it
                                            all gone way past his control, even alarming the two Heaven’s Expanse Palace
                                            Masters to activate the power of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Only then had
                                            they been able to suppress the powers of the clash.</p>
                                        <p>From the surface appearance, the clash between both parties did not have any
                                            repercussions, without any rippling effect. However, Shangguan Longyin was
                                            extremely clear that if any bit of the Will of the Demon God had escaped the
                                            Boundless Infinitium Formation, it would have brought an unimaginable
                                            destruction to the entire ZhongTian City. This area now would be an ocean of
                                            corpses.</p>
                                        <p>“You… you two…” Shangguan Longyin looked at Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, wanting
                                            to scold them in his heart, but realising that he could not just bring
                                            himself to do so. In truth, that level of Skills, he did not know what he
                                            could do if he met it. The only choice for him would to not allow them to
                                            have the chance to gather and infuse those Skills and unleash them.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged, smiling bitterly as he said: “Senior Shangguan, you
                                            can’t blame us for that. In truth, we did not wish to use such a things, nor
                                            did we want all this to happen. However, we had no choice if we wanted to
                                            survive. Their attacks were just too strong, and we could only use our own
                                            strongest attack to deal with it. If it caused any problems to you, I hereby
                                            apologise sincerely.”</p>
                                        <p>A similar bitter smile flashed across Shangguan Longyin’s face. “Problems? Is
                                            it just so simple as problems? Luckily, the Palace Master and Second Palace
                                            Master came in time and took action. Alright, enough of that, let us just go
                                            according to the rules of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. The Third Match of
                                            the Heavenly Bow Battle Team versus the Dan Dun Battle Team, the victor is
                                            the Heavenly Bow Battle Team.”</p>
                                        <p>The last line was using the voice-transference with his Heavenly Energy, and
                                            all the audience could clearly hear it. At this point, the disorderly
                                            comments and discussions began to rise from the citizens.</p>
                                        <p>Although they had experienced the panic and fear earlier, in this current
                                            instant, they were all starting to get excited once more. Indeed, such an
                                            experience, such a splendidly large scene, perhaps they would never get to
                                            experience a second time in their ordinary lives. This would definitely be
                                            imprinted in their memories forever. In the future, they could even tell
                                            their stories to their grandchildren, it was something to be proud of.</p>
                                        <p>At this point, only then did the rest of the Dan Dun Battle Team members come
                                            to their senses. Quickly, the rest of the team members rushed to carry
                                            TianFeng and TianMa back to rest.</p>
                                        <p>This time, the entire Dan Dun Battle Team consisted of Blood Red Hell core
                                            disciples, and naturally some of them had the Light Attribute. Quickly,
                                            Light Attribute healing Skills were used one after the other on the two
                                            brothers, at least barely stabilizing them. In truth, their bodies were not
                                            injured at all, what was critically wounded were their souls and bloodline
                                            power. However, at this point, as both were unconscious, it was clear they
                                            could no longer continue fighting in the round. Originally, TianFeng could
                                            still participate in the individual matches, but that was no longer
                                            possible.</p>
                                        <p>...</p>
                                        <p>The Rest Houses were all gone…</p>
                                        <p>When Zhou Weiqing brought Tian’er back to their Rest House to rest, only then
                                            did he realise that all the Rest Houses were gone, destroyed. In their first
                                            violent clash, the destruction was not limited to the stage and the newly
                                            created chasm, even the Rest Houses of all the Battle Teams had been
                                            affected, and all the other battle team members had been forced to withdraw.
                                            Still, It was lucky that happened, as what happened next was the giant crab
                                            unleashing its Destruction Aura, disintegrating the Rest Houses. If not for
                                            the swift reaction of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, when the Demon God
                                            Projection appeared, perhaps it would not have been so simple as just the
                                            destruction of the Rest Houses.</p>
                                        <p>Returning to their companions, all of them looked at the two with gazes as if
                                            they were monsters. Especially for Yun Li, who had always had a hint of
                                            recalcitrant air in him. After all, they were both at the six-Jeweled stage.
                                            However, at this point, that had totally vanished, and there was even a hint
                                            of fear as he looked at Zhou Weiqing. This fellow was just too powerful, too
                                            terrifying. Previously, the sheer horror of that aura, Yun Li did not even
                                            wish to try and remember it. He knew that in his life, he would never be
                                            able to catch up to Zhou Weiqing in terms of cultivation level and power,
                                            and the only thing he could do was to focus and work harder on his
                                            Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.</p>
