                                            over two thousand Wolf Cavalry soldiers losing their lives under the
                                            onslaught of Consolidated Bows. At this point, the officers of the Swift
                                            Wolf Regiment were about five hundred yards from the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>However, at this moment, the salvo from the Peerless Battalion halted
                                            momentarily. Most of the soldiers had ran out of Heavenly energy, and their
                                            Consolidated Bows vanished. They took out their ordinary longbows, but that
                                            required some time.</p>
                                        <p>After all, the majority of the Peerless Battalion soldiers had only just
                                            Awakened their Jewels with the help of the medicine and Shangguan Fei’er and
                                            the others’ Heavenly Energy, barely at a single Jewel cultivation level.
                                            Being able to shoot ten arrows with their Consolidated Bows was their
                                            absolute limit. Of course, there were a still few who had not started
                                            shooting yet; they were currently standing ready behind Hua Feng. They were
                                            the special forces or commandos of the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Although these special forces soldiers usually trained individually, they
                                            still belonged to their respective Companies, just that they would be
                                            transferred out during actual combat. There were eighty of them in total,
                                            and the seven god archers of the Heavenly Bow Unit were in charge of them.
                                            Of course, the thirty six Fire Attribute Elemental Jewel Masters were also
                                            amongst them, seven were Heavenly Jewel Masters, and the rest were the other
                                            Elemental Jewel Masters.</p>
                                        <p>The seven Heavenly Jewel Masters had also just Awakened not long ago, and
                                            without question, their future potential was much greater. Although they
                                            were already past the age of twenty, a Heavenly Jewel Master was still a
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master. These people were naturally separated out for their
                                            training, and they would be the future pillars for the Peerless
                                            Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>The longbows continued firing, arrow after arrow. However, without the
                                            Consolidated Bows and the support of Heavenly Energy, their power had
                                            dropped drastically. Having unleashed their bloodline power, the defensive
                                            capabilities of the Wolf Cavalry soldiers had raised substantially, and it
                                            would take at least a dozen of these ordinary arrows to kill one. As such,
                                            the death count of the Swift Wolf Regiment dropped. After losing a total of
                                            two thousand and five hundred men, they finally charged to three hundred
                                            yards of the Peerless Battalion.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing sat on his Single Horned Ghost Demon Horse, not making a sound,
                                            after all his soldiers were now listening to Hua Feng’s command. His gaze
                                            was focused right on the front of the Swift Wolf Regiment, the massive gold
                                            war wolf and its rider, Butler. Without question, he also knew that this had
                                            to be the Regiment Commander of the Swift Wolf Regiment. From the ferocious
                                            aura that this person was giving forth, Zhou Weiqing could sense how
                                            powerful he was.</p>
                                        <p>He had to be at least at the eight Jeweled cultivation level. This was Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s judgement of Butler. His own personal mission was simple - that
                                            was to take on Butler as long as possible and not allow him to have his way
                                            in slaughtering the Peerless Battalion soldiers. As such, he did not take
                                            action and fire like his soldiers, instead waiting silently there.</p>
                                        <p>“Battalion Commander, that gold war wolf mount is not simple at all.
                                            Something like that is at least a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast… extremely
                                            powerful in its own right. A warrior who can use it as a mount, he can only
                                            be even stronger.” Wei Feng said in a low tone, reminding Zhou Weiqing at
                                            his side.</p>
                                        <p>On the battlefield, personal strength might not easily influence the outcome,
                                            but personal strength could easily bring up their side’s morale.</p>
                                        <p>Also, when personal strength was so huge up to a point, then it would
                                            definitely be able to influence the outcome.</p>
                                        <p>“Don’t worry. Leave him to me. The rest of them are all of yours. Teacher Hua
                                            Feng, that gold war wolf and his rider in front of their pack is mine. The
                                            rest of them, I leave it up to you and your special forces.”</p>
                                        <p>Hua Feng looked at Zhou Weiqing deeply. How could he not see Butler’s power?
                                            Yet, at this moment, he could not possibly doubt Zhou Weiqing’s decisions,
                                            or go against his orders. Zhou Weiqing was the head of the Peerless
                                            Battalion, and at this point on the battlefield, his orders were everything;
                                            even if he thought they were wrong, he could not go against it or it would
                                            cause chaos amongst the men, affecting morale, and possibly even causing all
                                            their deaths. There were still seven thousand more Wolf Cavalry soldiers,
                                            seven thousand enraged wolf cavalry soldiers, and none of them would suspect
                                            how cruel and terrifying these angry wolf cavalry soldiers could be. Once
                                            they managed to charge to the front of their own formation and begin melee
                                            combat, then this fight would be totally over for them pretty quickly.</p>
                                        <p>In Zhou Weiqing’s plan, there should be no melee combat. Although the close
                                            combat prowess and power of the Peerless Battalion soldiers had improved by
                                            leaps and bounds under the tutelage of Shangguan Fei’er, once melee combat
                                            started, too many variables would be introduced, the difficulty increased,
                                            and it was likely that injuries and death would occur. All of that would be
                                            counter to Zhou Weiqing’s original motive, to improve and allow his Peerless
                                            Battalion to grow stronger, and to improve their morale.</p>
                                        <p>Another round of arrows, and the enemies charged closer again.</p>
                                        <p>Butler, charging right at the head of the pack with his gold war wolf mount,
                                            could now be seen clearly. His war wolf exploded in a fresh burst of speed,
                                            like a bolt of gold light speeding in a straight line, far surpassing his
                                            men by at least a hundred yards as he charged towards the enemy's line,
                                            bloodlust in his eyes as he fixated upon his target.</p>
                                        <p>Naturally, Butler had also noticed Zhou Weiqing earlier, seated atop his
                                            Single Horned Ghost Demon Horse as he waited for him, tall and stout with
                                            the aura of command, proudly awaiting him, clearly indicating his
                                            status.</p>
                                        <p>“Kill!” Butler howled in rage, his blood boiling within from the sheer anger.
                                            He truly believed that as long as he managed to charge within the enemy’s
                                            formation, it was not impossible to finish them all off. After all, he was
                                            at the nine-Jeweled cultivation level, a Upper Level Zong Stage Heavenly
                                            Jewel Master! The enemy only numbered a thousand five hundred or so, and he
                                            estimated they did not have anyone as powerful as himself.</p>
                                        <p>At last, Zhou Weiqing reacted, his right hand slowly lifting up towards
                                            Butler. They were still about a hundred and fifty yards from each other, and
                                            as soon as the gap between them was at a hundred yards, they would be able
                                            to attack each other. As such, he chose such a time to reveal his own
                                            aura.</p>
                                        <p>With a loud clash, his titanium alloy mail was cast aside, revealing his
                                            naked upper body, the healthy bronzed muscles shimmering in the bright
                                            sunlight.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shouted out loud, and in the next moment, he charged forward
                                            like an arrow shot from a bow. His charge, so straightforward, so valiant,
                                            and in midair a killing intent filled with death defying resolution exploded
                                            forth.</p>
                                        <p>For any troop of army, the character of the leading general would definitely
                                            have a great effect on the entire troop. Zhou Weiqing’s sudden eruption and
                                            his fearless charge towards the enemy’s strongest powerhouse… in that
                                            instant, it caused the entire Peerless Battalion’s morale and will to fight
                                            to be raised to the maximum.</p>
                                        <p>Their firing rates increased noticeably, and under Hua Feng’s direction, all
                                            their projectile arcing arrows all avoided Zhou Weiqing’s direction,
                                            avoiding any possibility of an accidental injury.</p>
                                        <p>Still in midair, Zhou Weiqing’s body started to shift, as the magnificent
                                            tiger tattoos appeared on his skin, the thick black-grey colour appearing
                                            instantly across every inch of his body, as a powerful overbearing aura
                                            burst forth like a king surveying his subjects. His muscles bulged and his
                                            eyes turned bloodshot as he seemed to soar higher into the air like a demon
                                            god descending.</p>
                                        <p>That was not the only thing. At the same time as his body entered the Demonic
                                            Change State, a shimmering illusory purple red figure appeared around his
                                            back. It was the Heavenly Skill Image of the Demonic Dragon Lady!</p>
                                        <p>The majority of the soldiers on both sides would not know what the Heavenly
                                            Skill Image actually meant, but how could the charging, ferocious Butler not
                                            know? As a Nine Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, he had once ascended the
                                            Heavenly Snow Mountain. The Heavenly Skill Image was an unreachable target
                                            of power in his heart.</p>
                                        <p>The sudden burst of power and aura along combined the Heavenly Skill Image of
                                            Demonic Dragon Lady was like a bucket of ice cold water pouring suddenly on
                                            Butler’s original powerful bloodlust, causing a chill to run down his spine.
                                            Even more shockingly, his war wolf mount companion suddenly slowed down
                                            abruptly, and he could sense it was shivering in fear.</p>
                                        <p>Without knowing why, at that moment, Butler suddenly sensed a terrifying
                                            aura… one that he had only once sensed previously from the great Heavenly
                                            Snow Mountain Lord… an aura that caused him want to fall to his knees in
                                            supplication. In that instant, his heart was filled with fear.</p>
                                        <p>Alas for him, due to the distance they were at, and the sudden powerful aura
                                            that burst forth from Zhou Weiqing, he did not notice that the number of
                                            Heavenly Jewels around his wrist was a mere four.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, in truth Zhou Weiqing in the Demonic Change State, how could his
                                            aura be that of Four-Jeweled stage only? Butler’s senses did not fool him,
                                            after all just from the bloodline quality difference alone, Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            Dark Demon God Tiger was at least equal or higher than even the Divine
                                            Heavenly Spirit Tiger. Furthermore, he had the aura of the Solidified Dragon
                                            Spirit within him. Although he was unable to access the power of the
                                            Solidified Dragon Spirit, it did not change the fact that the aura had
                                            already been integrated within him, especially when he unleashed the Demonic
                                            Change State without holding back, it was naturally let loose as well.</p>
                                        <p>A cold light was in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, and in that moment he was immersed
                                            in a strange feeling.</p>
                                        <p>That unique feeling had started when the Peerless Battalion soldiers had been
                                            shooting his arrows, and it had been accumulating ever since. Along with the
                                            shrill cries of the Consolidated Bows, the blood within his body felt as if
                                            it had been ignited, and now his eyes were only for that single foe before
                                            him. As a result, Zhou Weiqing was able to bring his aura to a maximum as
                                            soon as Butler came within range.</p>
                                        <p>Before he had come to this northern border, if he had met a nine-Jeweled
                                            cultivation level enemy, Zhou Weiqing would only have one choice - turn tail
                                            and run. The gap between the two was just too huge.</p>
                                        <p>However, ever since he had come to the border, he had not only become the
                                            disciple of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, he had also personally faced
                                            off against a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse. Although at that point he had
                                            not been the main person to take on his blows, after having experienced a
                                            powerhouse at a whole different level, he no longer held fear in his heart
                                            when facing a Zong Stage powerhouse. Furthermore, towards this fight before
                                            him, he had prepared so much for it.</p>
