                                            such, even though Tyrannical Bear was at the six Jeweled Stage, his Heavenly
                                            Energy was only at the eighteenth level. In comparison, Zhou Weiqing was a
                                            Four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, and his Heavenly Energy was at least at
                                            the sixteenth level, the fourth level of the Heavenly Shen Energy stage. In
                                            addition, his boost was all purely strength, and at a greater percentage. As
                                            such, in terms of just his Physical Jewel boost, he already held the
                                            advantage over Tyrannical Bear.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing raised both his hands, blocking Tyrannical Bear’s fists as they
                                            smashed down. In that moment of impact, the entire stage shuddered along
                                            with the massive crash.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing stood there, unmoving, while Tyrannical Bear staggered back four
                                            steps before finally regaining his balance. His face changed as he
                                            exclaimed: “Heavenly Jewel Master!”</p>
                                        <p>In truth, Tyrannical Bear’s cultivation level and power were pretty decent,
                                            coupled with his inborn superhuman strength, it was no exaggeration that he
                                            claimed to have the bloodline of bears. As a six Jeweled Physical Jewel
                                            Master, he was already considered one of the top dogs in the army. However,
                                            comparing strength with Zhou Weiqing would definitely put him at a
                                            disadvantage.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing’s Four Heavenly Jewels, Tyrannical Bear was not the only
                                            shocked one, as everyone stared with their eyes wide open and jaw agape.
                                            Even in the ZhongTian army, Physical Jewel Masters and Elemental Jewel
                                            Masters were relatively common, but Heavenly Jewel Masters were not common
                                            at all. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing was still a Four Jeweled, Lower Level Zun
                                            Stage Heavenly Jewel Master. Facing the six Jewels of Tyrannical Bear, the
                                            audience which original did not have much hopes for him had their
                                            expectations totally overturned.</p>
                                        <p>The two company Leaders from earlier were perhaps the most shocked. In truth,
                                            as a Four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, Zhou Weiqing could at least be at
                                            the Company Leader level once he joined the army. Furthermore, as long as he
                                            displayed any hint of leadership qualities and military capabilities, his
                                            promotion speed would be extremely quick. More importantly, Zhou Weiqing
                                            looked so young, at most slightly over twenty years of age. Such a young
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master… what sort of potential did he have in the future? No
                                            one could know for sure how strong his cultivation level and power would
                                            grow to!</p>
                                        <p>In the army, personal power and strength was one of the key factors for
                                            promotion.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at Tyrannical Bear with a faint smile and said: “Are we
                                            still continuing?”</p>
                                        <p>Tyrannical Bear did not reply Zhou Weiqing, instead charging towards him once
                                            more. One could lose a fight, but face could not be thrown so easily. If he
                                            stepped down just like that, he would be looked down upon and no longer have
                                            any face in the army.</p>
                                        <p>Tyrannical Bear’s two thick arms were like two huge poles, smashing down
                                            towards Zhou Weiqing once more. If one likened his previous strike to a
                                            testing blow, then this was definitely him going all out.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, Tyrannical Bear knew that with his power, he had no chance
                                            against a Four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master. Even so, he did not want to
                                            surrender just like that, and if he could hold on against such an opponent
                                            for some time, that would be of great satisfaction to himself.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, Zhou Weiqing did not plan on tangling with him for too long. Today, his
                                            purpose of coming to this Duelling Corner was not just for a simple
                                            Intermediate Competition victory. Since the Duelling Corner was a chance for
                                            him to gain rank quickly, he would definitely seize this opportunity and not
                                            let it slip from his fingers, as he needed to gain rank within the ZhongTian
                                            Army as quickly as possible; only then would he be able to carry out his
                                            plan.</p>
                                        <p>*PENG* Once more, without any flourishes or extra actions. This time,
                                            Tyrannical Bear staggered back even further, more than an entire metre,
                                            along with a massive clash. This time, Zhou Weiqing followed along with a
                                            quick step forward, his right palm striking out onto Tyrannical Bear’s
                                            chest, causing him to fly all the way to land outside the stage.</p>
                                        <p>This Stage was after all for competition purposes, not life and death fights,
                                            and they were not allowed to use weapons, let alone Consolidated Equipment.
                                            Undoubtedly, that greatly restricted Tyrannical Bear’s power as well,
                                            otherwise if Zhou Weiqing was hiding his own Consolidated Equipment and
                                            Stored Skills, it would take him some time and effort to defeat Tyrannical
                                            Bear at his full power.</p>
                                        <p>Tyrannical Bear had just lost like that, and more so, losing in a fight of
                                            Strength, what he had always been famous for.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, for Tyrannical Bear to be defeated by Zhou Weiqing was not
                                            something to be surprised about. After all, even though he was born with a
                                            supernatural strength, compared with Crow from the Gold Crow Tribe, it was
                                            like the difference between heaven and earth. Even Crow could not match Zhou
                                            Weiqing in pure physical strength, let alone Tyrannical Bear.</p>
                                        <p>With great difficulty, the Company Leader judge recovered his poise and
                                            proclaimed: “Zhou Little Fatty, Victory.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “If possible, I would like to continue. Didn’t you say
                                            that if I get five consecutive victories in the Intermediate Competition, I
                                            can be promoted to the Company Leader level? I would like to try my hand at
                                            it. I don’t think we need to draw lots, isn’t there six more Intermediate
                                            Ringmasters? Let them come one by one, I don’t need to rest.”</p>
                                        <p>In the first place, he had not used any Stored Skills or Consolidated
                                            Equipment, and the usage of Heavenly Energy was very minimal. Even if he had
                                            used more, with the recovery rate of the Immortal Deity Technique, it would
                                            be easy for Zhou Weiqing to continue fighting quickly. This was of course
                                            not even counting the Devour Skill.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s voice was not very loud, but with some Heavenly Energy, his
                                            words spread throughout the entire building. In order to gain rank quickly,
                                            he did not care too much about offending others anymore. Furthermore, having
                                            been in the Heavenly Bow Empire army before, he knew that in the army, it
                                            was not wrong to be arrogant, as long as you had the strength to back that
                                            arrogance up. Zhou Weiqing did not know if their rules allowed him to fight
                                            five Intermediate Challenges in one day, so he decided he might as well use
                                            some arrogance to provoke the other Intermediate Ringleaders, allowing him
                                            to get his five fights.</p>
                                        <p>“Allow me.” A delicate voice rang out, and in the next instant, a figure
                                            appeared onto the center stage.</p>
                                        <p>When he first heard that voice, because it was a female one, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            given a fright. His first reaction was that it was Shangguan Fei’er going
                                            crazy. However, when he saw the lady on the stage, he let loose a hidden
                                            sigh of relief. It was not Shangguan Fei’er after all.</p>
                                        <p>The young lady on the stage was not dressed in the ZhongTian army uniform,
                                            instead wearing a tight fitting attire. With a head of pale green, short
                                            hair, she was a picture of beautiful, spirited  valiance. She looked to be
                                            in her mid twenties, slim and athletic figure, with her skin a wheat colour
                                            with a healthy glow that showed she spent much time in the sun. The sleeves
                                            of her clothes were rolled up currently, revealing her shapely arms, though
                                            her hands were gripped in fists at the moment, a she looked coldly at Zhou
                                            Weiqing, like an angry lioness.</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou Little Fatty right… you will regret humiliating Tyrannical Bear like
                                            that. I am his Battalion Leader, and I will personally wash away the insult
                                            that you have awarded our Battalion. Come on then, I am the top Intermediate
                                            Ringmaster in the entire Sixteenth Regiment; if you can defeat me, you have
                                            no need to continue fighting in the Intermediate Competition, and I can make
                                            the decision to reward you with twenty gold coins and give you a direct
                                            promotion to Company Leader.” As she said that, a shimmering faint white
                                            light appeared around her.</p>
                                        <p>Four Sets of Heavenly Jewels appeared around her wrists, with the Agility
                                            Dragonstone Jade and the Fire Attribute Star Rubies, a rather classic fire
                                            and agility combination.</p>
                                        <p>For a Battalion Commander to already be that of a Four Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master, that was something almost unimaginable in other smaller Empires,
                                            especially since this Battalion Commander was a young lady.</p>
                                        <p>Looking at her, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but think of Shangguan Bing’er. At
                                            that time, wasn’t she also his Battalion Commander?</p>
                                        <p>“Bro Zhou, shall we begin the fight then?” The Company Leader that was the
                                            temporary judge asked Zhou Weiqing.</p>
                                        <p>Hearing his words, only then did Zhou Weiqing recover from his stupor.
                                            Looking towards the valiant young lady Battalion Commander, he smiled
                                            faintly and said: “May I ask, this beautiful lady Battalion Commander, what
                                            is your name?”</p>
                                        <p>She replied with a cold humph: “My name is Shen Yi.”</p>
                                        <p>“Shen Yi? (Godly Doctor)[1. Her name is 神依 vs 神医 (godly doctor)]” Zhou
                                            Weiqing repeated in surprise.</p>
                                        <p>“Hmph! It is 依依不舍 (Yi Yi Bu She)‘s 依 Yi. [2. Can’t exactly translate that.
                                            Basically she is correcting him. 依依不舍 (Yi Yi Bu She) is a chinese idiom that
                                            means having sense of reluctance to part from somebody.] Aren’t you very
                                            arrogant? Stop wasting time, do you want to fight or not?” Without asking,
                                            Shen Yi already knew from that surprised tone that Zhou Weiqing used that he
                                            had misunderstood her name. He was not the first, and would definitely not
                                            be the last to do so, as such, she quickly corrected him.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Alright, let’s go then!”</p>
                                        <p>As the judge announced the start of the fight once more, Zhou Weiqing’s fifth
                                            fight in the Duelling Corner started.</p>
                                        <p>Facing Shen Yi, Zhou Weiqing knew that he could no longer fight as casually
                                            and do as he pleased so easily. After all, she was a Heavenly Jewel master;
                                            even though he was confident in fighting a Heavenly Jewel Master of the same
                                            cultivation level, since she was also at the Four-Jeweled Stage. However, he
                                            would not be careless; after all, a Heavenly Jewel Master was very different
                                            from ordinary Jewel Masters; who knew if she had any secret skills like
                                            himself? He had seen too many Heavenly Jewel Masters lose due to
                                            underestimating their opponent; just in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament alone,
                                            hadn’t so many lost to him and his teammates due to underestimation? As
                                            such, Zhou Weiqing would never make the same mistake.</p>
                                        <p>Striking the ground with the tip of her feet, Shen Yi’s slim figure flew
                                            towards Zhou Weiqing, both her hands blazing with red flame as she struck
                                            out towards him.</p>
                                        <p>This was the superiority of a Heavenly Jewel Master, with their bodies
                                            boosted by the Physical Jewel, while still able to use their Elemental
                                            Attributes against their enemies. Facing such a strong, powerful fire
                                            attack, even if Zhou Weiqing’s strength was much greater than his
                                            opponent’s, he would not receive the blow directly so easily. After all, he
                                            was not invulnerable, and would be injured by such powerful flames.</p>
                                        <p>Since he had chosen to reveal his Wind Attribute, he would need to act like a
                                            proper Wind Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master. Facing Shen Yi’s attack, Zhou
                                            Weiqing suddenly retreated in a burst of speed; with the boost of the Wind
                                            Attribute, his speed was as fast as Shen Yi’s. At the same time, two green
                                            lights lit up around his arms, and they formed an indistinct-looking, sharp
                                            green blade of light along each arm.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Yi’s first attack did not successfully strike Zhou Weiqing, but that was
                                            not the end of her attack. With a jerk of her hands, the two balls of fire
                                            left her hands and flew towards Zhou Weiqing, right at the same time as the
                                            green light consolidated into the blades.</p>
                                        <p>Facing these two orange-red fireballs that were clearly far beyond the
                                            ordinary low rated Fireball Skill, Zhou Weiqing remained calm. A simple wave
                                            of his arms in midair, and the two green blades of light crisscrossed. A
                                            strange sight happened next, as the two fireballs seemed to split apart like
                                            tomatoes, sliced neatly into four, dissipating into the air.</p>
                                        <p>“What Skill is that?!” Seeing her powerful fireballs destroyed so easily,
                                            Shen Yi was left stunned.</p>
                                        <p></p>
