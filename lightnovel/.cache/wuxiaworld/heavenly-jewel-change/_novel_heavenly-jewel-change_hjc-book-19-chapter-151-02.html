                                            drinking in camp, this is a very serious rule… do not tell me that you do
                                            not know.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing did not even bother looking at her, instead turning to Shen Ji,
                                            saying: “As long as Legion Commander Shen Ji can give me a proper accounting
                                            about the Sixteenth Regiment coming to cause trouble, I can easily give you
                                            an accounting about the drinking.”</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing those words, Shen Bu started. Causing trouble in camp was
                                            definitely no small matter, but both sides did not have any casualties, so
                                            it would not be too serious. However, having an entire Battalion drinking to
                                            a drunken state, that was definitely much more serious. As the officer in
                                            charge, if charged with maximum punishment, Zhou Weiqing could even be
                                            beheaded.</p>
                                        <p>Upon hearing that, Shen Ji was also in an awkward situation. At this point,
                                            he was clear that he needed to be absolutely fair in handling this matter.
                                            If not for the fact that Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er were from the
                                            Heaven’s Expanse Palace, perhaps he would have already ordered their arrest.
                                            Still, his vision was extremely sharp, and he had also been given a huge
                                            shock upon seeing the mail armour that the Peerless Battalion soldiers were
                                            wearing. From the look of it and the glow, it all seemed like titanium
                                            alloy! How could that be…!?</p>
                                        <p>“The Sixteenth Regiment has intruded into the First Unique Battalion’s Camp
                                            to cause trouble, Regiment Commander Shen Bu has not exercised properly
                                            leadership and will be recorded with a serious demerit. All those who
                                            participated in this incursion, step out now. Each will be punished with
                                            forty strokes, to be carried out immediately.” Shen Ji bit the bullet and
                                            made the decision on the spot, giving the order.</p>
                                        <p>If Green Wolf had really died, Zhou Weiqing would not have let the matter
                                            slide so easily with just that. However, since his teacher had already saved
                                            Green Wolf, and the Peerless Battalion did not have any actual losses, there
                                            was no necessity in further increasing the enmity to an irreversible point.
                                            As such, Zhou Weiqing did not sound off during the process, watching the
                                            over hundred soldiers from the Sixteenth Battalion, including the two
                                            Battalion Commanders, get dragged out. They had already gone through a
                                            beating from the Peerless Battalion, and now the other Sixteenth Regiment
                                            soldiers had to administer the beatings upon them, and watching this happen,
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s anger subsided. The other Peerless Battalion soldiers also
                                            showed looks of satisfaction on their faces. However, several of them still
                                            had worried looks on their faces. After all, no matter what, a collective
                                            drinking was no small matter, and they waited in silence to see how Zhou
                                            Weiqing would handle the matter.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu’s face had almost turned green as she watched her subordinates get
                                            beaten, but she could not do anything about it, and she could only watch on,
                                            stewing in anger.</p>
                                        <p>After the forty lashes, most of the Sixteenth Regiment men who had been
                                            beaten could not even get up, and they had to be carried away. As she
                                            watched that all happen, though she knew she should not continue provoking
                                            Zhou Weiqing, she could not help but ask him angrily: “My men have already
                                            received their punishment, so what is the accounting you said? You were all
                                            drinking, and even those Regiments camped around could smell the wine. What
                                            do you have to say to that? Don’t tell me that you lost your memory, let’s
                                            see how you account for that.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said passively: “Since I have already said I will give an
                                            accounting, I will definitely do so. Men, bring the remaining of the food we
                                            ate last night, and let Legion Commander Shen Ji and Regiment Commander Shen
                                            Bu have a look.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji was originally rather irritated that Shen Bu would continue pushing
                                            the issue, but now that he heard Zhou Weiqing’s words, he started in
                                            surprise. He was really going to give an actual accounting? After all,
                                            drinking in camp was a very huge issue. Previously, he had already been
                                            prepared to gloss over the matter, and if not for Shen Bu suddenly speaking
                                            out, he was already about to leave with his men. In his eyes, Zhou Weiqing
                                            was after all from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, how could he possibly go to
                                            military court? Even if he did so, they would not be able to actually punish
                                            him. However, now that he looked closely at Zhou Weiqing, he saw the
                                            confidence in him. It was clear he had something up his sleeve.</p>
                                        <p>Yet, what reason could he possibly have for allowing his men to drink?</p>
                                        <p>In a matter of moments, several large cauldrons were carted up, holding the
                                            remains of the last night’s meal. They had been drinking and eating through
                                            the night, and naturally they had not managed to clear it up yet. The
                                            cauldrons still had some remaining food, large pieces of meat floating in
                                            oil.</p>
                                        <p>Seeing the large cauldrons in front of him, Shen Ji looked towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing questioningly.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Legion Commander Shen Ji, this is what
                                            we ate last night. You have been fighting in the northern borders for many
                                            years, and I am sure you can tell what meat this is right?”</p>
                                        <p>On hearing his words, a notion struck Shen Ji, and he quickly stepped forward
                                            to examine the contents.</p>
                                        <p>The war wolf bones were not the same as other ordinary wild beasts, and
                                            ordinarily army rations would not be able to feed their soldiers with so
                                            much meet. Shen Bu also stepped up to look at the contents of the cauldrons,
                                            as she did not understand what Zhou Weiqing had meant.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, she exclaimed in surprise: “What… this is…? Is this wolf
                                            meat?”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji had also noticed the same thing, and he said: “This… it looks like
                                            the war wolf mounts of the Wolfman Tribe. The war wolf meats are large and
                                            tough, much unlike other wild animals, and their bones are also shaped
                                            differently and extremely tough.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded in agreement and said: “That is right, this is the meet
                                            from war wolves. This time, we have returned to the Seventh Legion, and we
                                            have also brought a gift for Commander Shen Ji. Men, bring over two hundred
                                            of the war wolf corpses for Legion Commander Shen Ji!”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu said uncertainly: “What does that got to do with your drinking?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her disdainfully before saying mockingly: “For you to
                                            be able to become a Regiment Commander with that brain of yours, I can’t
                                            help but say that you must have gotten in through the back door and
                                            connections. Let me ask you, in the army, under what circumstance is it
                                            allowed to drink?”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Bu said angrily: “What circumstance? There is no circumstance, it is
                                            against the rules.”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a humph and ignored her, turning his gaze to Shen Ji.</p>
                                        <p>By that point, Shen Ji had begun to understand, and he said solemnly: “There
                                            is only one circumstance where it is allowed to drink… that is after a
                                            victory over our enemies. Furthermore, it has to be a major victory before
                                            soldiers are allowed to drink in celebration. So many war wolves… Battalion
                                            Commander Zhou, you fought with the Wolf Cavalry soldiers?”</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Before we returned to camp yesterday, our
                                            Peerless Battalion fought again the Swift Wolf Regiment.”</p>
                                        <p>Hearing the words ‘Swift Wolf Regiment’, both Shen Ji and Shen Bu’s
                                            expressions changed. They had spent quite some time in the northern borders
                                            and had clashed many times with the WanShou Empire armies, and the losses
                                            every year was extremely high. Sometimes, they were even forced to retreat
                                            to the TianBei City for a last ditch defence. How could they not know of the
                                            notorious Swift Wolf Regiment? That was the absolute elite of the Wolfman
                                            Tribe, and their leader Butler was a well known nine-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel
                                            Master, extremely ferocious and savage in combat. Even if the entire Seventh
                                            Legion were to clash with them directly, they would not be at any good
                                            advantage.</p>
                                        <p>“Nonsense, with just the few of you, if you really met the Swift Wolf
                                            Regiment, you would all be dead.” Shen Bu’s expression was full of
                                            disbelief.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “I do not need you to believe me, as
                                            facts are louder than words. The Wolfman Tribe corpses are still littered in
                                            that area, and Legion Commander Shen Ji can always dispatch men to check. We
                                            only brought back a portion of the war wolf mount corpses as our spoils of
                                            war, and left all the rest there. In the battle against the Swift Wolf
                                            Regiment, we killed four thousand of them… is that considered a major
                                            victory? In the fight against the ferocious Swift Wolf Regiment, we did not
                                            sustain any injuries, yet when we returned here, we were injured by our
                                            allies. Legion Commander Shen Ji, if it were you, could you tolerate such a
                                            thing? Today, my brother here was lucky not to die, otherwise, I would not
                                            have let it go so easily.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji looked at Zhou Weiqing with a complicated expression in his eyes.
                                            Just like Shen Bu, he could believe what he had heard… could not believe
                                            that it was all true. After all, the Peerless Battalion only numbered how
                                            many people? At the most, slightly over a thousand men… being able to take
                                            down four times their number against the Swift Wolf Regiment, he just could
                                            not believe it. The war wolf mounts were unbelievably quick, and even if the
                                            Seventh Legion fought against them, as long as it wasn’t some sneaky ambush,
                                            they would not be able to get such a similar grand result.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, Shen Bu’s expression changed. However, she did not speak,
                                            instead tugging at Shen Ji’s sleeve, and her gaze shifted subtly towards
                                            Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>Although Shen Ji did not know what his junior sister meant, but he could
                                            easily tell that she wanted to beat a retreat.</p>
                                        <p>After a slight hesitation, Shen Ji said: “Battalion Commander Zhou, I will
                                            definitely check out what you mentioned. If things are as you said, the
                                            Peerless Battalion has indeed accomplished an outstanding merit, and I will
                                            report up to the higher ranks to award you all. Also, since it is a
                                            celebration, last night’s drinking is of no issue. Regiment Commander Shen
                                            Bu, lead your men away. Battalion Commander Zhou, I will also take my leave
                                            now.”</p>
                                        <p>He did not stay any longer, as he had many things to investigate before
                                            reaching a final conclusion. At the same time, he could sense that Shen Bu
                                            had something to tell him, and it would be best to leave this place as
                                            quickly as possible. Staying here in such a stalemate would also be a loss
                                            of face to him if it spread to other Legions.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing said passively: “In that case, I will not send you all off. I
                                            hope that no other Battalions will intrude in our Peerless Battalion camp,
                                            otherwise if something like this happens again, Legion Commander Shen Ji you
                                            can’t blame me.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji nodded and said: “I will give the order for the entire Legion to keep
                                            their men under control. Farewell.”</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji led Shen Bu and the other men away, and after they left the Peerless
                                            Battalion camp, they heard a loud cheer from behind, as if they had chased
                                            away some plague. The Peerless Battalion men’s loud cheers and laughter
                                            showed their lack of qualms or inhibitions, causing Shen Bu’s expression to
                                            turn ugly once more. If her psyche was any lesser, perhaps she would have
                                            been so enraged that she would have vomited blood.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, the Peerless Battalion soldiers were all extremely excited. Zhou
                                            Weiqing had sided with them without hesitation, standing up against an
                                            entire Regiment for their sakes, perhaps even against the entire Seventh
                                            Legion. Such a Battalion Commander, where else could they find one like him?
                                            In that moment, Zhou Weiqing’s standing and prestige in the entire Peerless
                                            Battalion was raised to a new maximum, and before he could even speak, the
                                            soldiers had swarmed forward to throw him up in the air in celebration,
                                            shouting and cheering as they did so.</p>
                                        <p>Shen Ji’s face was extremely overcast, but in order to save Shen Bu’s face,
                                            he remained silent until they entered her Sixteenth Regiment main tent. Once
                                            her guards had left, he shouted angrily: “Shen Bu, what are you doing?
                                            Didn’t I warn you not to provoke that Zhou Weiqing? Why didn’t you listen to
                                            me? If he were to actually kill you all today, how could I answer to
                                            Master?”</p>
                                        <p></p>
