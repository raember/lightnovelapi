                                        <p>Under Zhou Weiqing’s command, the Peerless Regiment soldiers entered their
                                            formation. The Gold Crow and Berserker Tribe Heavy Cavalry soldiers were in
                                            front, and the four hundred and fifty Peerless Cavalry behind. Zhou Weiqing
                                            and the classmates that he had brought from the Fei Li City remained behind
                                            the main troop. For this particular fight, they would not even be needed to
                                            join in. Zhou Weiqing wanted to let them familiarize themselves with how the
                                            Peerless Regiment soldiers fought, at the same time displaying to them the
                                            sheer power of their Peerless Regiment.</p>
                                        <p>…</p>
                                        <p>Crescent City. City Walls.</p>
                                        <p>A group of patrolling soldiers strolled about lazily on the city walls.
                                            Technically, they were supposed to be on shift for eight hours before the
                                            guard would change, but in truth, it was already considered very good when
                                            there were three or four Companies in total on guard[1. Previously the
                                            information Kou Rui scouted out was the ‘technical’ shift of 1000 guards, so
                                            they are saying only 300-400 are actually present at most times]. Most of
                                            the Kalise soldiers were complacently resting in their barracks.</p>
                                        <p>The Crescent City was a prosperous city with good positioning, and thus there
                                            were many visitors, especially traveling merchants, and it was without doubt
                                            that income was good. Taxes aside, which had to be sent back to the Kalise
                                            Empire, just the soldiers charging for entrance fee was already a rather
                                            large sum of gold and income for them.</p>
                                        <p>“Eh? Did you all hear something?” One of the soldiers with sharper ears
                                            suddenly asked.</p>
                                        <p>“I think so as well, rolling sounds of thunder… is it going to rain?” Another
                                            soldier said, even looking up into the skies. However, it was currently mid
                                            afternoon, and the skies were clear, bright and sunny with not even a cloud
                                            in sight. The weather was definitely good… what rain was there?”</p>
                                        <p>The Kalise soldiers were all puzzled, as the sound of rolling thunder grew
                                            more and more obvious.</p>
                                        <p>All of a sudden, one of the soldiers’ expression changed. “Could it be…
                                            cavalry soldiers?!”</p>
                                        <p>As he spoke those words, in the distance, a brilliant glint of reflected
                                            sunlight flashed into their eyes.</p>
                                        <p>It was the titanium mail of the Peerless Regiment Cavalry soldiers,
                                            reflecting light as they charged! More so, the two hundred Heavy Cavalry
                                            soldiers right in front were like majestic beasts charging forth.</p>
                                        <p>The speed of the Unicorn Heavenly Beasts were far superior than any ordinary
                                            warhorses, even if they were carrying the thousand jin Gold Crow and
                                            Berserker Tribe warriors.</p>
                                        <p>“Enemies…! We are under attack!!” Screams and shouts began to rang out from
                                            the city walls, and the alarms soon began to ring as well.</p>
                                        <p>For a time, chaos reigned upon the city walls. Ever since they had invaded
                                            and conquered the Heavenly Bow Empire, these Kalise soldiers had enjoyed
                                            peace and quiet in the Crescent City for too long. This sudden surprise
                                            attack from these unknown cavalry soldiers caused them to fall into a panic,
                                            the city walls thrown into confusion.</p>
                                        <p>One of the Company Leaders was relatively calm. “Do not panic, hurry up,
                                            remember your training! Prepare the ballista, archers get into position!
                                            Hurry, hurry! You there, get the brothers below to shut the city gates
                                            immediately!”</p>
                                        <p>Just as he was shouting out a flurry of commands, all of a sudden, a soldier
                                            beside him stared wildly into the skies, point as he yelled: “Wha… What is
                                            that?!”</p>
                                        <p>A few dozen figures had somehow floated in the skies. They had wings behind
                                            their backs, and in that instant, a shower of death rained down from the
                                            skies.</p>
                                        <p>In just a single salvo of arrows, all the soldiers around the eight ballista
                                            lined up along the city walls fell down. Some of the Kalise Empire soldiers
                                            with quicker reactions raised their bows returned fire.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, shooting arrows down from a vantage position was different from firing
                                            it upwards at such a distance. Let alone with most of their range was
                                            insufficient to reach the flying figures, even if their arrows could reach
                                            them, how could they possibly break through the titanium mail of the
                                            Peerless Regiment soldiers?</p>
                                        <p>For the sake of stability and safety, to prevent the ballista from causing
                                            any potential problems, Zhou Weiqing had specially arranged for another
                                            fifty Peerless Regiment soldiers to fly into the air to give the soldiers on
                                            the city wall a heavy blow. Furthermore, it would also be a good distraction
                                            for Lei Zi’s force inside.</p>
                                        <p>Almost at the exact same time, the city gates below was also in a mess. At
                                            this moment, Lei Zi was leading his fifty Peerless Regiment soldiers,
                                            clearing away the Kalise Empire soldiers guarding it like they were cutting
                                            melons and cabbages[2. Literal translation, basically means with great
                                            ease]. Fifty Jewel Masters, what kind of notion was that? That was already
                                            the sum of the Heavenly Bow Empire’s total number of Jewel Masters in the
                                            past! Towards ordinary soldiers, it was akin to wasting talents on trivial
                                            tasks, with not the least bit of suspense at all towards the completion of
                                            the task.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s voice suddenly rang out in all the Peerless Regiment soldiers’
                                            ears. “All of you better listen carefully. Once we enter the city, besides
                                            the Kalise soldiers, you are not to kill anyone or rob anyone. Otherwise,
                                            you will be strictly dealt with in our military code. It is not that Your
                                            Father, I, am unreasonable, but this is my homeland. Once we revive my
                                            homeland, and it is time to counterattack and invade the Kalise Empire, or
                                            even the Bai Da Empire, there will be chance for you to loot and plunder all
                                            you wish. Now, charge with all your might! Those who attempt to stop you,
                                            slaughter them all!”</p>
                                        <p>Suppression from the air, control of the city gates… In the end, the Peerless
                                            Regiment soldiers’ charge did not meet with much resistance at all. The
                                            arrows from the few Kalise archers who actually managed to shoot at them
                                            were just like a mere joke, so much so that the Heavy Cavalry soldiers in
                                            front did not even bother swinging their weapons at the arrows, allowing the
                                            arrows to bounce off their armour.</p>
                                        <p>By the time the garrisoned troops in the Crescent City had begun to react,
                                            the Peerless Regiment had already charged into through the open city gates.
                                            What followed next was just a pure one-sided slaughterfest.</p>
                                        <p>Towards these Kalise Empire soldiers who were occupying his homeland, Zhou
                                            Weiqing did not hold any thoughts of being lenient. If one came, he would
                                            kill one. If two arrived, he would slay the pair.</p>
                                        <p>Even the powerful WanShou Empire armies and their terrifying combat prowess
                                            had failed against the Peerless Regiment, let alone these ordinary soldiers
                                            from the Kalise Empire. Within a short period of a mere hour, more than a
                                            thousand of the garrisoned Kalise Empire soldiers had died, with the
                                            remaining surrendered.</p>
                                        <p>For Kou Rui, Yan Zhexi, these classmates that had followed Zhou Weiqing from
                                            the Fei Li Military Academy, they were all staring at the sight before them
                                            with their mouths agape, totally dumbfounded. This battle had totally
                                            overturned the military knowledge they had learned in the past few
                                            years!</p>
                                        <p>Just like Zhou Weiqing had told Tian’er, this was a battle which needed no
                                            strategy. Simple, direct, a headon clash. Yet, the result was a complete
                                            victory, perhaps ‘crushing’ victory would even be more apt. As the saying
                                            goes, what you hear may be false, but what you see is true… Zhou Weiqing had
                                            used actions to prove to them that following this big bro was definitely a
                                            right choice.</p>
                                        <p>After taking care of all the defending troops, Zhou Weiqing immediately
                                            issued a series of fresh commands. “Close all the city gates, and I want
                                            fifty men each stationed on all four walls. Do not let anyone leave the city
                                            at all. Lei Zi, lead a squad of brothers to the Governor’s Abode. Bring all
                                            the officials of the Crescent City to see me. All of you, when you are
                                            acting on these orders, shout out this slogan as you do so. As loud as you
                                            can. ‘Princess Difuya has returned, along with the Heavenly Bow Empire’s
                                            Peerless Regiment to revive our homeland! Heavenly Bow has returned!’”</p>
                                        <p>Previously, even when he had first set up the Peerless Battalion, Zhou
                                            Weiqing had already started to prepare for the future, of possible avenues
                                            of attacks for reviving the Heavenly Bow Empire. Indeed, though the Heavenly
                                            Bow Empire was considered small, they still had quite a number of cities.
                                            This Crescent City had been specially chosen by Zhou Weiqing to be his first
                                            target. Of course, the caveat for that was that he needed to gain the
                                            support of the Fei Li Empire first. In this way, the Crescent City would
                                            have the Fei Li Empire to its back, and supply lines ensured, leaving it a
                                            good place to be a primary base.</p>
                                        <p>Although the Peerless Regiment was extremely powerful and seemingly glorious
                                            all around, they definitely had their own weak points as well. The most
                                            glaring one was that they did not have their own logistics and supply team.
                                            In the ZhongTian Empire’s Northwest Army camp, that point was an issue as
                                            they had the full support of the Northwest Army. However, now that it was a
                                            full campaign to revive the Heavenly Bow Empire on their own, it was not
                                            possible to hope that the ZhongTian Empire would continue to send them
                                            supplies, and they could only depend on themselves. Everything else aside,
                                            even having their daily meals would be a problem.</p>
                                        <p>As such, Zhou Weiqing’s first plan was to set up a stable base and foundation
                                            for them to take care of any supplies and logistic issues. At the same time,
                                            it would serve to begin announcing themselves to the Heavenly Bow Empire
                                            borders, to recruit the warriors and fighters of the Heavenly Bow Empire who
                                            were scattered throughout. Gradually, as their foundation stabilized and
                                            they grew, they could continue with further plans and follow-up actions.</p>
                                        <p>As for the orders he had just issued, it could be said to be rather simple
                                            but ingenious. Firstly, not allowing anyone to leave the city would delay
                                            the arrival of any enemy troops. As for the slogan he had his men yell out,
                                            it was naturally to calm the populace down, and to sow the seeds of his
                                            recruitment plans. After all, he currently only had seven hundred men, and
                                            if he had to use them to maintain law and order, it was rather insufficient
                                            for an entire city. He couldn’t possibly use the Gold Crow and Berserker
                                            Tribe members as a policing force either, their size and stature would give
                                            most ordinary people a scare. As such, shouting out such a slogan was a
                                            relatively effective method. In the first place, the Kalise Empire’s
                                            occupation of the Heavenly Bow Empire was not that long yet, and the
                                            Heavenly Bow Empire had always treated its citizens well. Zhou Weiqing
                                            believed that the overall sentiment of the people would still be slightly
                                            inclined towards the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p>
                                        <p>Breaching and occupying a single city could be said to be very simple for the
                                            current Peerless Regiment soldiers. However, the continued control and
                                            maintenance of said city was a very different matter, especially to use it
                                            as a stable base; that was truly not an easy task. However, Zhou Weiqing was
                                            not in a rush at all. All he needed to do with his seven hundred men was to
                                            fortify their defenses and spread the news that Princess Difuya had returned
                                            together with him, leading a strong army to revive the Heavenly Bow Empire.
                                            At the same time, he would have to establish supply lines with the Fei Li
                                            Empire. Once all of that was arranged, only then could he begin the actual
                                            fighting to revive their homeland.</p>
                                        <p>With the city coming under attack so suddenly, citizens would usually learn
                                            of such news later. Most of them only realised the Crescent City had been
                                            under attack when they heard the shouts of the slogan.</p>
                                        <p>Princess Difuya of the Heavenly Bow Empire had returned with an army? They
                                            were looking to revive the Empire? Very quickly, the news spread in a short
                                            time over the entire Crescent City.</p>
                                        <p>The effect was even better than Zhou Weiqing had expected. Before long, the
                                            entire city had calmed down, and there were no disturbances at all. However,
                                            the traffic in the city had almost disappeared, all the houses with closed
                                            doors and sealed windows, as if afraid that they might be caught up any
                                            fighting or battles.</p>
                                        <p>With Zhou Weiqing’s strict orders in mind, the Peerless Regiment soldiers
                                            only guarded the city gates and walls, and did not violate any of the
                                            people’s interests. Of course, the exception were the three thousand Kalise
                                            Empire soldiers. Besides their arms and weaponry, all of their gold was also
                                            seized. Zhou Weiqing did not keep anything, splitting everything between his
                                            men.</p>
                                        <p>The Peerless Regiment had after all come from the Ruffian Battalions, and
                                            though their loyalty to him was already extremely high, and he no longer
                                            needed to use wealth as a binding tool, he did not remove any good
                                            treatments to them.</p>
                                        <p>Very soon, the Governor of the Crescent City and the other officials were
                                            brought in front of Zhou Weiqing. After some questioning, Zhou Weiqing
                                            quickly understood the current status and situation that the Crescent City
                                            was in, and he ordered for these officials to be kept under guard for now.
                                            At the same time, he got some official notices to be made and posted
                                            throughout the city.</p>
                                        <p>The notices were very simple, listing all the officials of the Crescent City.
                                            He had men stationed at the notices, allowing the citizens to make reports
                                            on how good or bad these officials were. At the end, he could use that
                                            information to decide who he could continue using, or if any were traitors
                                            or did too many ill deeds, he would kill them. It was as simple as that.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of governing and maintaining a city, Zhou Weiqing did not know
                                            anything about doing so. However, many of the current officials in the were
                                            not from the Kalise Empire, and many of the middle to lower officials were
                                            originally from the Heavenly Bow Empire. As such, he would only need to
                                            remove some of the Kalise officers in the upper echelons, as well as weeding
                                            out some of the other rotten ones. What Zhou Weiqing needed was for the
                                            entire city to resume its usual operations perfectly, and not just a simple
                                            occupation. At the same time, he also sent news that under their new
                                            command, the taxes in the entire city would be waived for a year.</p>
