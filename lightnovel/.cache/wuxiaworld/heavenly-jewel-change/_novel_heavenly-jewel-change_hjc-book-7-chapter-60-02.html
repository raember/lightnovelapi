                                            example, using it on Lin TianAo now would only give him an additional layer
                                            of defense.</p>
                                        <p>However, hearing Zhou Weiqing’s shout, Yun Li knew that Zhou Weiqing had
                                            found a chance. As the saying goes, opportunities had to be seized instantly
                                            or it would be lost forever. Despite his misgivings, Yun Li did not hesitate
                                            at all. So as not to ‘lose’ himself a second time in a day, he struck forth
                                            with all his might, pitting his life with his utmost strength.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li’s body leapt high into the air, a loud cry rang forth from his lips. A
                                            thick silver light covered him, as all four of his Gold-Green Cat’s Eye
                                            Elemental Jewels lit up together. His four Spatial Attribute skills once
                                            again focused on the Consolidated Equipment Spike in his hands as he sprang
                                            towards Lin TianAo’s left leg in this last strike.</p>
                                        <p>After the shout, Zhou Weiqing stopped his rapid fire arrow. Focusing all his
                                            Heavenly Energy and channeling it out, two of his Alexandrite Cat’s Eye
                                            Jewels fell into the sockets of the Overlord Bow, but it was covered by the
                                            left hand gripping the bow.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing’s shout not only alerted Yun Li, but also gave Lin TianAo an
                                            advance warning. Narrowing his eyes, he unleashed all the skills on his
                                            shield, instantly increasing the defense of not just his body but the shield
                                            again. Even without using his eyes, he could sense the massive power built
                                            up behind him, and knew that Yun Li was about to unleash his final attack.
                                            He was also clear that if he could defend against this attack, Yun Li would
                                            be useless for the rest of the fight. Under such a circumstance, it would be
                                            worth it to expend as much energy as was required.</p>
                                        <p>The arrow was finally released from the Overlord Bow. In the very instant
                                            when Zhou Weiqing let go of the drawstring, the red robed man at the side
                                            suddenly clutched his ears as a massive ringing resounded. The next instant,
                                            he felt a sharp pain in his head, as everything in front of him turned
                                            blurry.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing would never expect that Tian Er’s aid for him was not against
                                            Lin TianAo, but instead to draw the attention of this judge and audience -
                                            the red robed man. This was to ensure he would not learn of Zhou Weiqing’s
                                            secret of the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel and his many powerful skills.</p>
                                        <p>This time, the arrow shooting forth was pitch black. Even stranger, there
                                            were squiggly bright blue lines twisting and turning on the black arrow.</p>
                                        <p>Dodging this was definitely impossible as they were just too close to each
                                            other. Not talking about dodging, Lin TianAo wasn’t even able to see the
                                            arrow at all.</p>
                                        <p>Another huge explosion rang out, the double explosive effect of archery skill
                                            and Overlord Bow once more striking the heavy shield, no different from the
                                            previous arrows. The explosive power of the arrow was naturally totally
                                            blocked by the shield. However, in the next moment, Lin TianAo’s expression
                                            changed.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time as he released the arrow, Zhou Weiqing’s right foot had
                                            slammed into the ground, and his body charged forward as well. The Tornado
                                            Strike had been activated, along with the boost of speed from his Demonic
                                            Right Leg, caused him to instantly reach Lin TianAo.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li, who was behind Lin TianAo, was also given a big surprise, as he
                                            suddenly saw Lin TianAo, who was originally covered in the yellow Rock
                                            Armour, suddenly glow with a bright blue. An explosion followed soon after,
                                            and the entire Rock Armour actually disappeared.</p>
                                        <p>Not just that, a dark black also stained Lin TianAo’s body, and a strange,
                                            eerie looking black symbol appeared above his head.</p>
                                        <p>Curse - This was the Curse Skill. Yun Li immediately identified the black
                                            symbol above Lin TianAo’s head.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li had already known about Zhou Weiqing’s Darkness Attribute after having
                                            lost to him earlier in the shop 77 when Zhou Weiqing had used the Blood
                                            Rites - Seal of Darkness on him. However, he had not expected Zhou Weiqing
                                            to also have one of the rarer skills of the Darkness Attribute, the Curse
                                            Skill.</p>
                                        <p>The Curse Skill was actually a type of Skill within the Darkness Attribute
                                            skills, basically a form of reverse-support, or more commonly known as
                                            debuff skills. Support skills were used to buff or boost the user, or their
                                            allies, while Curse skills would weaken their enemies. The type, amount and
                                            extent of weakening, the duration, all of that would determine how powerful
                                            the Curse Skill was. By the black symbol above Lin TianAo’s head which had
                                            an obvious three red lines, it was clear that this particular Curse Skill
                                            weakened three attributes, and was probably at least a powerful Nine Star
                                            Rating Darkness Attribute.</p>
                                        <p>As for why the various defensive skills active on Lin TianAo suddenly
                                            dissipated, Yun Li did not know why. However, no matter how it happened, all
                                            that mattered was that it was definitely beneficial to his own attack. No
                                            matter how strong or tough Lin TianAo’s personal defense was, if he did not
                                            have his skills active and he did not block Yun Li’s powerful attack, he
                                            would definitely be in trouble.</p>
                                        <p>What Zhou Weiqing used was naturally an arrow with two skills due to the two
                                            sockets on the Overlord Bow, and the two skills were new skills that he had
                                            Stored when he entered the Fei Li City, and both were all considered support
                                            or control type skills.</p>
                                        <p>The Curse Skill was naturally a sort of support skill.</p>
                                        <p>Yun Li’s judgement was indeed accurate - the Darkness Attribute Skill was
                                            indeed a Curse Skill, and its name was the Curse of Doom. Its powerful
                                            effect was to weaken the opponent’s defense, attack and lastly to increase
                                            their sense of pain. This Skill was rather strange, the higher level it was,
                                            the shorter the duration, but the stronger the effect. At the first level,
                                            it lasted 12 seconds, and the three attributes were all weakened by ten
                                            percent. It was rather useless at that level, besides its long duration.
                                            However, every Jewel cultivation level that was added would increase the
                                            power of the curse by ten percent for all three attributes, but the duration
                                            would shorten by a second. As such, with three sets of Jewels, Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s Curse of Doom would weaken Lin TianAo’s defense, attack by thirty
                                            percent, and increase his sense of pain by thirty percent as well, for a
                                            total of ten seconds! This was extremely powerful indeed. In the future, if
                                            Zhou Weiqing ever became a twelve-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, this skill
                                            could possibly bring his opponent’s defense to a negative, even if it was
                                            just for a second, it would be more than sufficient for any other skill to
                                            deal a heavy injury.</p>
                                        <p>The Curse of Doom was even rarer than the Skills that Zhou Weiqing had Stored
                                            from the Silver Emperor. He had been lucky that he had managed to Store this
                                            Skill as well, as under ordinary circumstances it was less than a 1 in 10000
                                            chance that someone could manage to Store the Skill.</p>
                                        <p>As for the Skill that dissipated the Defense Skills on Lin TianAo, it was
                                            another powerful but niche support skills. This was the Lightning Attribute
                                            Skill, the Heavenly Lightning Shock.</p>
                                        <p>In most people’s eyes, the Heavenly Lightning Shock was another niche skill
                                            that was usually deemed useless despite its power. It did not have any
                                            attacking or damaging capabilities, and it had only one use - to dissipate
                                            skills. It only worked on Stored Skills, and also was similar to the
                                            Absolute Delay that it would never ‘level up’. That meant it would always
                                            last for 3 seconds no matter what cultivation level he was. Of course, at
                                            the same time, it was also another Absolute effect, and would definitely
                                            dissipate any Skill.</p>
                                        <p>As long as any Jewel Master was hit by the Heavenly Lightning Shock, any
                                            Skills they were in the midst of using, or was currently affecting them,
                                            would immediately be dissipated.</p>
                                        <p>There were two reasons why many Jewel Masters thought this skill to be niche
                                            and somewhat useless. First of all, it was only activated on touching the
                                            opponent’s body. The second was that although it could interrupt skills, it
                                            would not affect any that had already left the body. For example, if someone
                                            used a Fireball Skill which was already in mid air, and the Heavenly
                                            Lightning Shock was used on him, the Fireball would not dissipate.
                                            Furthermore, there was no other control provided by the Skill. Since
                                            Lightning Attribute Jewel Masters were very rare in the first place, and
                                            they were mostly known for their powerful damaging attacks, many would not
                                            choose this niche skill, and it was only rated at four stars. After all,
                                            every Jewel Master had a very limited amount of Skills, and who would pick a
                                            Skill that could only be useful in rare circumstances? Only someone like
                                            Zhou Weiqing, who had more than four times the usual skills most Jewel
                                            Masters had, could afford to do so.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, just like the Spatial Shackles, although the Heavenly Lightning
                                            Shock was niche, when used in the right circumstance, it could have an
                                            amazing god-like effect. This was just a perfect example - having it
                                            dissipate all three of Lin TianAo’s defensive skills, including the Rock
                                            Armour, right at the perfect timing. Although the Shield was able to weaken
                                            half of most support skills, it was not able to weaken this Absolute Skill!
                                            With the help of the Socket of the Overlord Bow, Zhou Weiqing was able to
                                            make use of it without being in close combat.</p>
                                        <p>With these two skills used in conjunction on Lin TianAo, although it wasn’t
                                            able to affect his shield, it did greatly lower the personal defense of his
                                            body.</p>
                                        <p>Still charging in midair, Zhou Weiqing let loose another arrow. This time, it
                                            was only imbued with a single skill - Absolute Delay.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo immediately felt a sense of impending doom. Just as he was about
                                            to spin his shield around, the Absolute Delay reached, and he felt his
                                            entire body slow down as it took effect, and the spin of the shield slowed
                                            to a crawl.</p>
                                        <p>Right at the same time, Yun Li had reached Lin TianAo’s back, the glittering
                                            spike striking out at his leg.</p>
                                        <p>A critical moment had finally arrived. If Lin TianAo took this full power
                                            blow from Yun Li without any defenses, it would be without question that he
                                            would lose the bet. Under such a circumstance, he had to use his last ace in
                                            the hole. The shield in his hand glowed brightly once more, and a thick
                                            layer of light immediately formed a shield around his back.</p>
                                        <p>Another huge explosion sounded out as Yun Li’s body flew back once more,
                                            rebounding heavily along with a ear-piercing shattering sound. The yellow
                                            light which blocked Yun Li’s attack also shattered, and Lin TianAo’s leg was
                                            clearly injured, with a deep bloody line. However, no matter what, Lin
                                            TianAo had not moved.</p>
                                        <p>Lin TianAo heaved a big sigh of relief. That last shield of yellow light was
                                            his last ace in hand, and was the strongest unique power of the five-Jewel
                                            Assembly Set Shield. It was called the Illusory Shield, and was basically an
                                            illusion of his shield that could appear in any nearby position according to
                                            his will. The illusion had a fifth of the defensive power of the actual
                                            shield, and it could only be used once every time he Consolidated the
                                            five-Jeweled Assembly Shield. Furthermore, to use it was a huge drain on his
                                            Heavenly Energy, and he only used it in his most desperate times to save his
                                            life. Naturally, this time it had done so once more.</p>
