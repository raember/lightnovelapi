                                        <p>To Shangguan Xue’er, the Boundless Infinitum Sword was like her own life.
                                            However, she did not wish to lose the fight just like this, and more so, did
                                            not wish to marry Zhou Weiqing. Yet, she also could not bring herself to
                                            kill him. Left with no choice, she could only compromise with this worst
                                            choice.</p>
                                        <p>As the Boundless Infinitum Sword left Shangguan Xue’er’s hands, it vanished
                                            instantly. In the next moment, her right hand slammed savagely towards Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s face.</p>
                                        <p>However, at that very instant, Shangguan Xue’er saw the crushing despair in
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s eyes.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, it was despair. Zhou Weiqing opened his mouth, and a mouthful of
                                            blood spat out, and his entire body fell back down before Shangguan Xue’er
                                            could even strike at him. His entire chest was stained red with blood.</p>
                                        <p>“Ahhh… no good!” Shangguan Xue’er was caught by surprise, immediately
                                            realising that Zhou Weiqing had been severely injured by her sword. Not the
                                            sword that had pierced right through his right chest, but the strongest blow
                                            that she had struck earlier!</p>
                                        <p>That’s right! Facing that strongest sword of hers, even a nine-Jeweled
                                            Heavenly Jewel Master might not be able to take it head on, let alone Zhou
                                            Weiqing with his six-Jeweled cultivation level. Oh no… was he really about
                                            to die?</p>
                                        <p>Shanggua Xue’er’s original palm strike turned into a grab, holding onto Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s left hand as she pulled the falling body back up. With a step
                                            forward, she held onto his body.</p>
                                        <p>However, before Shangguan Xue’er could even examine his wounds, her hand had
                                            been counter grabbed by Zhou Weiqing. The Devour Skill appeared once more.
                                            This time, it was direct contact, and was far stronger than when it was
                                            executed through the Boundless Infinitum Sword.</p>
                                        <p>His legs lifted up abruptly, wrapping around Shangguan Xue’er’s waist in a
                                            clinging fashion and with a wrestler’s twist, he had forced her onto the
                                            ground below him.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, after the previous period of recovery and the Devouring, his
                                            Heavenly Energy had already reached a point above Shangguan Xue’er. The
                                            reason why he continued using such shameless methods was because he did not
                                            want to face any more invincible techniques from Shangguan Xue’er if it
                                            wasn’t necessary.</p>
                                        <p>Alas, by the time Shangguan Xue’er had realised it, it was already too late.
                                            The remaining Heavenly Energy in her body was being drawn out bit by bit by
                                            Zhou Weiqing, and her body was being pressed down by his. The masculine
                                            scent from Zhou Weiqing, along with the smell of blood, and the drain of
                                            Heavenly Energy… coupled with the fact that she was so angry, with a muffled
                                            groan she actually fell unconscious.</p>
                                        <p>It was Zhou Weiqing’s turn to be frightened, and he quickly stopped the
                                            Devour Skill. Subconsciously, he patted her on the face, ensuring that she
                                            was alright before he relaxed. At this point, he was panting hard, the
                                            intense pain from his chest and hands causing him to grimace. However, after
                                            that, he was still feeling smug. No matter what, he had won this fight.
                                            Earlier, Shangguan Xue’er had even sworn that she would marry him…
                                            right?</p>
                                        <p>Foursome… Triplets! Was there anything more joyous than that?! With such
                                            sudden evil thoughts coming to his mind, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt like his
                                            chest wasn’t hurting as much anymore.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, when he had descended from the skies, he had already prepared for
                                            this. Of course, he knew why Shangguan Xue’er was so quick to agree to his
                                            bet. In that circumstance, it would have been impossible for him to defeat
                                            Shangguan Xue’er with a direct clash. As such, he had came up with such a
                                            plan. If Shangguan Xue’er had pierced towards his heart, he had his own way
                                            of dealing with it as well.</p>
                                        <p>Previously, up on the Heavenly Snow Mountain, the Entropic Nether Tiger
                                            Phelia had given Zhou Weiqing a present - a Stored Skill that belonged to
                                            her! This Skill did not have any offensive capabilities, but it was a
                                            miraculous defensive Skill. The Skill name was also a simple ‘Nether
                                            State’.</p>
                                        <p>When he activated the ‘Nether State’, he would enter a state of being totally
                                            immune to any physical attacks for the next three seconds. Although it was
                                            just three seconds, but what did being immune to physical damage mean! That
                                            means any weapons could not wound him. If timed correctly, that was
                                            tantamount to three seconds of total immunity!</p>
                                        <p>Previously, Zhou Weiqing had actually used this very Skill when he had
                                            clashed hard with Shangguan Xue’er, so that he did not take any damage from
                                            her sword intent as well. The greatest benefit of the ‘Nether State’ Skill
                                            was that it could be instantly activated without any sign, and at his level
                                            he could use it a maximum of three times daily.</p>
                                        <p>Since Zhou Weiqing had already used it once, if Shangguan Xue’er really tried
                                            to kill him, he could make use of the ‘Nether State’ Skill once more to
                                            protect himself as he activated his Devour Skill. It would still leave him
                                            with one more chance of using the ‘Nether State’ Skill in case of any
                                            unforeseen circumstances; for example if Shangguan Xue’er really tried to
                                            cut off his hands, he would have activated it instantly. As such, no matter
                                            what, Zhou Weiqing had a contingency plan for almost all possible
                                            outcomes.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, he definitely would not wish to use such a contingency plan.
                                            Furthermore, he had strong confidence that Shangguan Xue’er would not
                                            actually strike to kill. As such, he had gone through his daring plan that
                                            was almost like betting his life. More so, the smartest part of his plan
                                            that he would actually allow himself to be stabbed right through by
                                            Shangguan Xue’er, and she would never expect to what degree that Zhou
                                            Weiqing could control his own body and even innards.</p>
                                        <p>With the toughness and power of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, although it
                                            seemed like Zhou Weiqing was entirely pierced through his right chest, due
                                            to the fact that he had more than sufficient to prepare to receive that
                                            blow, in the instant that his right chest was pierced through, Zhou Weiqing
                                            had actually forcefully shifted his lungs to the side, allowing the sword to
                                            pierce right through the gap between his sternum. As such, although it was a
                                            thorough wound that looked horrifying, in truth it was not too serious. Zhou
                                            Weiqing had also managed to avoid injuring any of his important meridians as
                                            well!</p>
                                        <p>This was the miraculous power of his body in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation
                                            state. Under Zhou Weiqing’s meticulous control, he did not even bleed at the
                                            start. It was only at the end when he wanted to delude Shangguan Xue’er that
                                            he controlled the blood to flow out of those wounds, creating the illusion
                                            that he had been severely wounded. After he had forced out a decent looking
                                            amount of blood to cover all the wounded areas, he had actually closed off
                                            the wounded area once more. He did not even need anyone to help heal him,
                                            with just the regenerative powers of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation State,
                                            that horrifying looking wounds could be recovered fully in just a relatively
                                            short period of time.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s loss could be said to be truly an unjust win, yet at the
                                            same time, not at all. She had lost to the sheer experience of Zhou Weiqing…
                                            not in terms of combat abilities, but experience in terms of being shameless
                                            and perfect acting skills. In this manner, perhaps no one else could compare
                                            with our dear Zhou Little Fatty. In a manner of speaking, it was no shame to
                                            lose to Zhou Weiqing like this… after all she was not the first, or even the
                                            most powerful person to lose to him that way!</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing lay down on the floor, recovering his Heavenly Energy at the
                                            same time as he healed his wounds. The Dragon-Tiger Transformation state was
                                            truly quite disgusting; his skin and muscles were originally already
                                            extremely tough and flexible, and the damage taken was smaller than it
                                            seemed. As Zhou Weiqing lifted his hands, he could clearly see the muscles,
                                            meat and even skin knitting themselves together. It was the same scenario
                                            for the wound on his chest. Though he had lost quite some blood, with the
                                            toughness of his body it was not a big deal.</p>
                                        <p>One could say that in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state, his physical
                                            regenerative capabilities were almost as disgusting as his Heavenly Energy
                                            recovery rate! In just a short period of time, both wounds on his hands and
                                            chest were almost fully healed. His Heavenly Energy recovery was even more
                                            terrifying, with his tank almost back up to full. However, after that, he
                                            did not change to a fresh set of clothes, instead holding Shangguan Xue’er
                                            in his arms like before. This time, he did not press down on her, instead
                                            laying on the ground and having her lie atop him. He then closed his eyes
                                            and concentrated, slowly circulating a thin thread of Heavenly Energy into
                                            her body to rouse her back to consciousness.</p>
                                        <p>Acting pitiful to gain sympathy. Such an ‘art’ had long since been perfected
                                            by Master Zhou…</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er was after all not injured at all; it was a mixture of an
                                            excessive consumption of Heavenly Energy as well as too much rage at once
                                            that caused her to faint. Her physique might not be comparable to Zhou
                                            Weiqing in his Dragon-Tiger Transformation State, but it was far stronger
                                            than any ordinary human, or even most Jewel Masters. With the aid of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy, she quickly regained consciousness.</p>
                                        <p>With a small movement, Shangguan Xue’er slowly opened her eyes.</p>
                                        <p>“Ahhh---” The first thing she saw when she opened her eyes was a mess of red.
                                            That was because she was lying right on Zhou Weiqing’s chest, and was given
                                            a sudden fright by the blood soaked clothing.</p>
                                        <p>In her fright, she did not even realise that those wretched hands of Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s were rested on her pert buttocks. Vaulting up into a sitting
                                            position, she pressed her hand onto Zhou Weiqing’s chest as she examined his
                                            heartbeat worriedly.</p>
                                        <p>As the saying goes, acting had to come in a full package. Zhou Weiqing had
                                            released the Dragon-Tiger Transformation and was controlling his heartbeat
                                            to a feeble slow rate.</p>
                                        <p>“Zhou Weiqing, Zhou Weiqing, how are you?” Shangguan Xue’er wanted to use her
                                            Heavenly Energy to help him heal, but at that moment she barely had any
                                            left, and she was unable to do anything. In such a state, she was extremely
                                            worried, helping his upper body up into her embrace as she tried to wake him
                                            up.</p>
                                        <p>After a time, Zhou Weiqing gave a soft mumble as he slowly ‘awakened’, though
                                            the light in his eyes were dim, as if he was about to ‘go out’ at any
                                            time.</p>
                                        <p>“Xue’er… did…I... win…?” Zhou Weiqing said faintly and disjointedly.</p>
                                        <p>Shangguan Xue’er held on this his hand and said urgently: “In this situation,
                                            you still can’t forget about all that? How are you feeling?” She was all too
                                            familiar with the power of her Boundless Infinitum Sword. Once someone was
                                            struck by it, the boundless power would instantly destroy all meridians and
                                            internal organs in reach. That was the reason why Shangguan Xue’er did not
                                            have any suspicions about Zhou Weiqing being severely injured.</p>
                                        <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head gently, looking so horribly weak. “Xue… er… I… I
                                            don’t think I can make it. It… it doesn’t hurt, just… numb… Xue’er… it
                                            counts… as my victory right? Help… help me… tell Bing’er… and Fei’er… that I
                                            really love them. I might have some … philandering ways, but… I truly… love
                                            them… cannot control… my own… emotions…”</p>
                                        <p></p>
