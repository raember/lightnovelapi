                                        <p>“Please do not come looking for me… I beg you ok? I know you, and I know that
                                            with your character, it is very easy for you to charge into something
                                            without caring about the consequences. However, if you really do so… then
                                            you are letting down all my painstaking efforts in doing all this. You now
                                            have much more important things to do. At least… before you have sufficient
                                            power, do not come looking for me. I will try my best to convince my
                                            father.”</p>
                                        <p>“I’m going now, I do not have any regrets, only yearnings for you. Weiqing,
                                            you have not told me that you loved me forever yet… but I love you…”</p>
                                        <p>“Your Tian’er, your Fat Cat.”</p>
                                        <p>……….. <i>Yes! How could I give up so easily?? When I was at the lowest point
                                            of my life, when I first heard news of my Empire being invaded and
                                            destroyed… it was Tian’er who was beside me. It was she who comforted me,
                                            encouraged me, gave me the hope to live, the strength to start working
                                            towards everything I now have today. Tian’er gave me her most precious self
                                            in order to help me recover myself… As she said before herself, in her life,
                                            she will only belong to me! I haven’t even told her how much I love her
                                            yet...</i></p>
                                        <p>She is my Fat Cat, my Tian’er! Only mine!</p>
                                        <p>The memories of how Tian’er gave all of herself to him flooded back into his
                                            mind… the memories of the past few years, how he hugged Fat Cat to sleep...
                                            her warmth and comfort… Zhou Weiqing felt his spirit filled with an
                                            indescribable yet powerful strength.</p>
                                        <p>All of the pain seemed to be somehow suppressed by that powerful spiritual
                                            power, allowing his spirit core to be clear. His eyes, having turned
                                            bloodshot earlier, slowly turned back to their usual hue, recovering some of
                                            their lustre, yet turning deeper and more profound... forming a strange yet
                                            fresh contrast to his body, which had somehow subconsciously entered the
                                            Demonic Change State on its own accord.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, in those deep black orbs of Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, there was only
                                            firm resolution. No matter how much pain, how much torture and suffering
                                            that tore away at his very being… for Tian’er, I will definitely withstand
                                            everything. Definitely.</p>
                                        <p>Long Shiya stood at the side. He had personally witnessed everything
                                            happening in Zhou Weiqing’s body, and currently, this Six Ultimate Heavenly
                                            Emperor was truly stunned to his core.</p>
                                        <p>In his life, Long Shiya seldom felt true respect for anyone. Although he
                                            might not speak it outright, in the entire world, there were only two people
                                            he truly respected. One was Duan Tianlang, a man who had spent his life
                                            fully on the Legacy of Strength, reaching the pinnacle of the Consolidating
                                            Equipment Master world.</p>
                                        <p>The other one was the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian. Of course,
                                            regarding this, Long Shiya would never admit it, but Xue AoTian was truly at
                                            the height of the world, the Heavenly God Tier power that even he could not
                                            reach. In his heart, he always had that spark of respect towards Xue AoTian.
                                            Countless of times he had challenged Xue AoTian, and countless of times he
                                            had failed, and that had also given him a unique relationship between him
                                            and Xue AoTian.</p>
                                        <p>However, at this point, Long Shiya realised that deep in his heart, there was
                                            now one more person that was worthy of respect. His precious disciple…</p>
                                        <p>Ordinarily, a teacher, a master, would not respect or admire his own
                                            disciple, but now, it was without doubt that deep within Long Shiya’s heart,
                                            such an emotion had arisen.</p>
                                        <p>The change that had overcame Zhou Weiqing just now was just too clear.</p>
                                        <p>As Long Shiya had been constantly infusing Heavenly Energy into Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s body, he could clearly sense the changes in his mind’s core, and
                                            he was also clear how close Zhou Weiqing had been to breakdown. Although
                                            Long Shiya was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, he was helpless to provide aid
                                            at that moment, and could only watch on worriedly.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, Long Shiya had been filled with regret, regret that he had
                                            actually agreed to bring Zhou Weiqing here to Awaken his Solidified Dragon
                                            Spirit in advance… Now, he could only watch this unbelievable young talent
                                            that was his one and only disciple, full of hope to overtake himself and
                                            breakthrough to the Heavenly God Tier in the future, breakdown and perish.
                                            One could imagine the sheer agony in Long Shiya’s heart. However… just as he
                                            thought Zhou Weiqing would breakdown, a miracle truly appeared.</p>
                                        <p>In that instant, the illusory image of the Dark Demon God Tiger above Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s head seemed to shimmer and fade slightly, becoming paler. Right
                                            beside the immense black tiger, another illusory image shimmered into
                                            existence, even paler, but clearly a huge white tiger.</p>
                                        <p>Towards that image of the white tiger, Long Shiya was just too familiar.
                                            Although it was shimmering and faded, barely a shadow, he could instantly
                                            see that it was Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger of the Heavenly Snow
                                            Mountain!</p>
                                        <p>Along with the appearance of the illusory white tiger, four balls of light
                                            stealthily appeared above Zhou Weiqing’s head. One fully black, representing
                                            the Darkness Attribute, one grey, representing the Demonic Attribute, one
                                            gold representing the Divine Attribute, and the last purple, representing
                                            the Spirit Attribute. The four different colours forming a strange
                                            whirlpool, spinning around as they entered Zhou Weiqing’s head from his
                                            BaiHui Acupuncture Point. Right at that instant, Zhou Weiqing’s entire
                                            spirit seemed to lift up, the feeling that he was about to breakdown at any
                                            point disappearing totally. As his spirit raised, his own body clearly
                                            showed a change.</p>
                                        <p>The first change was that the two bouts of Light and Darkness Heavenly Energy
                                            that Long Shiya had sent into Zhou Weiqing’s mind’s core to protect him was
                                            actually forcefully shoved back out.</p>
                                        <p>Next, the two energies duking it out in Zhou Weiqing’s body, the Solidified
                                            Dragon Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline powers actually paused
                                            momentarily in a temporary peace. Although it was just an instant, it was
                                            clear that their fight afterwards was no longer as violent, as if they were
                                            being restrained by a third party energy.</p>
                                        <p>What kind of powerful spiritual energy was required to do something like
                                            that! At this point, Zhou Weiqing had finally truly reached the actual cycle
                                            of Awakening the Solidified Dragon Spirit, and he had finally tided over the
                                            initial danger period. Now that the initial danger period was over, the next
                                            process was even more smooth sailing than Long Shiya had expected.</p>
                                        <p>Without question, for all of that to have happened, the most important thing
                                            was Zhou Weiqing’s devotion and obsession. If not for that powerful
                                            willpower, he would have broke down long ago. This was also the reason why
                                            Long Shiya felt such respect. He had to ask himself, perhaps if he was in
                                            Zhou Weiqing’s place, he did not have confidence of being able to do the
                                            same.</p>
                                        <p>The most curious thing to Long Shiya was why the Four Saint Attributes [1. I
                                            checked several sources and the paragraphs above is accurate. However,
                                            Darkness Attribute isn’t one of the Saint Attributes, it should have been
                                            the Time Attribute instead I believe (so let’s just take it as such)] would
                                            appear above Zhou Weiqing’s head at the same time, along with the bloodline
                                            powers. This was truly inconceivable.</p>
                                        <p>In truth, the reason why such a state of affairs had happen was indeed
                                            because of Tian’er… and it could be said that in such a critical period,
                                            Tian’er had saved Zhou Weiqing’s life.</p>
                                        <p>Originally, Tian’er was in her evolving stage when she met up with Zhou
                                            Weiqing, and it was because of Zhou Weiqing’s two Saint Attributes of
                                            Demonic and Time that she had started staying together with him. It was
                                            exactly the complete combination of the Four Saint Attributes that had such
                                            a huge draw to Tian’er.</p>
                                        <p>At that time, Zhou Weiqing’s personal cultivation level and strength was just
                                            too low that he had not sensed anything about this, and that attraction
                                            level was not as obvious to him.</p>
                                        <p>After that, the two of them had spent several years together. During that
                                            time, Tian’er’s cultivation level had grown by leaps and bounds. It could be
                                            said that by staying with Zhou Weiqing, both of them had the complete
                                            combination of the Four Saint Attributes circulating, greatly improving the
                                            speed of their cultivation… just that Zhou Weiqing did not know anything
                                            about it.</p>
                                        <p>When Tian’er had broken through to her seven-Jeweled cultivation level, the
                                            four Saint Attributes had circulated, bringing Zhou Weiqing to breakthrough
                                            to his next cultivation level as well. At that time, although Tian’er had
                                            indeed gained a large amount of benefit from Zhou Weiqing, her own energy
                                            had definitely influenced him greatly as well.</p>
                                        <p>On that fateful day, on the Heavenly Jewel Island, both of them had shared a
                                            precious night, and Tian’er had given her most precious first time to Zhou
                                            Weiqing. However, in that process, the Four Saint Attributes had also gone
                                            through a most thorough ‘mixing’. As such, from that time on, not only
                                            Tian’er, but Zhou Weiqing as well, both their bodies held some of each
                                            others’ energies.</p>
                                        <p>At this current moment, as Zhou Weiqing was facing death, the last stubborn
                                            obsessive thought in his mind was Tian’er. The two Saint Attributes that
                                            belonged to Tian’er that were left remaining in Zhou Weiqing’s body was
                                            actually activated and awakened.</p>
                                        <p>The power of the Solidified Dragon Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger
                                            bloodline was undoubtedly extremely strong, but when the four Saint
                                            Attributes came together, the sheer vast and boundless power, and more
                                            importantly, their state was at a level above all. As such, as the stubborn
                                            obsession in Zhou Weiqing’s heart and the Four Saint Attributes came up
                                            together, they successfully brought him through his most dangerous period,
                                            bringing him to the right path of Awakening his Solidified Dragon
                                            Spirit.</p>
                                        <p>Such a turn of events, no one could have expected all the various paths that
                                            had led to this… and as Zhou Weiqing realised he was on the route to
                                            success, even he felt it was inconceivable… let alone Long Shiya.</p>
                                        <p>Right in the center of Zhou Weiqing’s forehead, a tiny glow of light
                                            appeared. It was not too large or obvious, just the size of a mere broad
                                            bean, but its sheer lustre caused the surrounding magma to almost pale in
                                            comparison.</p>
                                        <p>If one were to examine closely, they would be able to see that the light was
                                            actually made four different colours mixed together… it was the representing
                                            colours of the Four Saint Attributes. They slowly moved down from Zhou
                                            Weiqing’s forehead, slowly entering his skin that was submerged in the
                                            magma.</p>
                                        <p>At that point, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that strange energy
                                            circulating around his body before stopping right at his chest area.</p>
                                        <p>All the pain was still there, but by now, he no longer had any thought of
                                            giving up. Furthermore, as the strange whirlpool had intervened, both the
                                            Solidified Dragon Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline energies
                                            started gathering at the center of the whirlpool, merging within. Strangely,
                                            at this current point, they were being released in the center of the
                                            whirlpool, but miraculously able to fuse together, stopping right at the
                                            center of Zhou Weiqing’s chest area.</p>
                                        <p>At the beginning, due to the whirlpool being extremely small, it was only
                                            able to draw in and merge a very tiny amount of both energies. However, as
                                            time passed, and more of both energies were drawn in and merged, the
                                            whirlpool grew larger and larger, and its glow seemed to dim a little.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why the whirlpool grew larger was because the fresh energies that
                                            was being merged in was also starting to move along as well. As such,
                                            although the speed of the spinning did not increase, the draw on the
                                            Solidified Dragon Spirit and the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline energies
                                            continued increasing. This was also the reason why Zhou Weiqing’s pain was
                                            gradually weakening.</p>
